<p>
A tear, a falling raindrop from my eye.<br>
Amidst the fluffy white clouds sprinkled throughout the sky.<br>
Dazed an exquisite dove winged upon the ground.<br>
Wondering why freedom has bestowed him, earth bound.<br>
Mind, oh the rhyme of wanting to touch the highest peak.<br>
Down along the struggle how the dove sang his weep.<br>
Muscles honed as glass hesitating until the fall.<br>
Ensuing with a downward plunge, how fast, as fast as rhythm he saw.<br>
Then that split second, he'd risen up his beak.<br>
He danced unto the sky for the freedom that he reaped.<br>
Sing me, yes, that song little dove of your achievements that once was.<br>
Tell me where has your piper gone, and of who this story is of.<br>
Which of us has risen unto that sky above<br>
And of who casts that teardrop that now, bestows life unto a bud.<br>
