That is at this chakra known as Viśhuddhi chakra.<br /> Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa is the Complete Form. Where ... why do we say the Complete? Because for Him the whole Play, the whole Līlā, was to be just seen. This whole creation was nothing but just a play created.<br /> He had reached that stage, and He talked of it. He said, "Nainaṃ chindanti śhastrāṇi, nainaṃ dahati pāvakaḥ": "You cannot be killed by any instrument, or by anything."<br /> And He did Saṃhāra. His greatest quality was that He killed many demons on this Earth.<br /> Now those who talk of nonviolence will say, 'How? He was a violent man.' There is a Divine Method which has to be employed to kill those demons. That was needed, and He did kill.</font><br /> <b>1977-0222 Public Program, Day 1, About Different Chakras and Their Deities, Gāndhī Bhawan, Delhi University, North Campus, GC Narang Road, Timarpur, New Delhi, India</b><br /> <br /> <font color="DarkRed">And Kṛiṣhṇa had said, "Nainaṃ chindanti śhastrāṇi, nainaṃ dahati pāvakaḥ." This Ātmā and the Vibrations cannot be destroyed. Come what may, this cannot be destroyed.<br /> Just to prove this, the birth of Christ took place.</font><br /> <b>1978-0201 Public Program (Hindi), Brahma kā Gyān (Knowledge of Brahma) or Mūlādhāra to Viśhuddhi, Āgñyā, and Sahasrāra, 9 Raisina Road, New Delhi, India</b><br /> <br /> <font color="DarkRed">So-o-o, His purpose was to come on this Earth, on the Āgñyā chakra, as you know that, to open it, and the ... to give a new dimension to our awareness by which we try to understand what Kṛiṣhṇa had said: that, "Nainaṃ chindanti śhastrāṇi, nainaṃ dahati pāvakaḥ." Kṛiṣhṇa had said that, "The Spirit cannot be destroyed, It cannot be killed, It cannot be wiped out, It cannot be blown off." "Na chainaṃ kledayanty āpo, na śhoṣhayati mārutaḥ." "It cannot be sucked in by any air." <br /> And when Kṛiṣhṇa said that, people said, "What sort of a Spirit is that? Where is that Ātmā? What are You talking about? Which One it is?"<br /> So, Christ came on this Earth because He is the essence.<br /> And He showed by His Resurrection that Spirit does not die. And He showed it very clearly what Kṛiṣhṇa had said, because He was, you know, He was Kṛiṣhṇa's Son, and that's how He did it.<br /> But before He could deliver the complete thing to human beings they crucified Him. And that is ... mhh ... that is [laughing:] the way they respected Him and that is the way they came to Him. </font><br /> <b>1978-1224 Talk to Sahaja Yogis, Thankfulness Is the Way to Joy, There Is No Other Way and Christmas Is a Day of Thankfulness (Thank Every Moment, Every Minute), Āśhram, 8, Hamilton Road, Dollis Hill, London NW10 1NX, UK</b><br /> ......<br /> <br /> <font color="DarkRed">Uh [laughing:] only trouble with Sahaja Yogis is that they take things [a] little lightly. Of course, that is their character. But not Sahaja Yoga. Other things you can take lightly: if somebody shouts at you, somebody gets angry with you, somebody even slaps you, take it lightly. Doesn't matter. Makes no difference to you. Because you are the Spirit: nothing can destroy the Spirit. "Nainaṃ chindanti śhastrāṇi" ["Weapons do not cut It": first part of the first verse of Bhagavad Gītā 2.23].<br /> But when it comes to Sahaja Yoga, your attitude should be different. If you are relaxing on one side, another side you have to be dynamic. And that side is: where you have to put forward the theories of Sahaja Yoga, and you have to talk to people, you have to organize a press conference, or whatever sort of things you want to do.</font><br /> <b>1993-0321 Birthday Pūjā, Satya Yuga, New Delhi, India</b><br /> ......</p><p><br /></p><p> <b>2.47 IAST</b><br /> karmaṇy-evādhikāras te mā phaleṣhu kadāchana<br /> mā karma-phala-hetur bhūr mā te saṅgo 'stvakarmaṇi</p><p><br /></p><p> <b>2.47 Translations</b><br /> <font color="Peru">Thy concern is with action alone, never with results.

You will find these kind of self-satisfied people a lot.<br /> It is not possible. This is diplomacy.<br /> What is the essence of diplomacy? Let Me tell you the essence of diplomacy which is that, 'Put the absurd condition in front.' A person will fall trap into his own web.<br /> Now, see the play of the words here where He said that, "You do your karma and leave the fruit at the feet of God." It's an impossible situation where this is an absurd condition.<br /> Now human being is trying to do it like stupid. All right, keep on doing. Unless and until you are [<font color="orange">unclear</font> detached/broken], until your karma becomes akarma, until you become empty from within, this can't be achieved because ego and superego are sitting on your head. Whatever you will do it will be either by the force of ego or by superego.<br /> So how can you surrender to God unless you have a connection with God?<br /> He in fact said: "Karmaṇy-evādhikāras te mā phaleṣhu kadāchana." Kṛiṣhṇa said this and that too by putting this absurd condition because it's not easy to get human beings to the right understanding.<br /> I am watching that even after six thousand years the situation is still the same.</font><br /> <b>1978-0131 Public Program (Hindi), Day 2, Void, Heart, Viśhuddhi, Channels, New Delhi, India</b><br /> ......<br /> <font color="DarkRed">For karma, He said: that, "Do all the work and put it at the Lotus Feet of God Almighty." That's not possible. Many people say: that, "Mother, all my work, I put at the Lotus Feet of God." Even the murders, I think! [Smiles.] It['s] just a mental idea: that, 'I am putting it at the Lotus Feet of God.' You cannot! Because you are not at that state.<br /> But say, a Sahaja Yogi, he will not tell Me, that 'I am raising the Kuṇḍalinī,' he'll say, 'Mother, it doesn't come up. Is not coming, it ...', in the third person he talks. He will say: 'This won't go that side,' in the third person. Because he is no more there.<br /> So, this is what is the karma: automatically is at the Lotus Feet of God Almighty, if He is doing everything! We are just instruments!</font><br /> <b>1991-1206 Public Program, Day 1, Narada Gana Sabha, 254 Mowbrays Road, Alwarpet, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India</b><br /> ......<br /> <font color="DarkRed">The second one was the karma, that you do your work. You go on doing your work, with a 'detached mind'. I mean it's not possible, but that's what they say. And we are doing our karmas, good karmas, we do all kinds of good things, go to various places for our cleansing, meet many great people of spirituality, go to all various places, and pray. Visit all auspicious places which are being described, all kinds of rituals, we do for that.<br /> That is the ... Karma Yoga.<br /> And that is what: the Karma Yoga, according to us, is the right side.<br /> Many people, as you know, are right-sided. Right-sided people are the people who are, as you know, full of ego, arrogance, and think no end of themselves. Very difficult to correct them. They also never see anything wrong with them. Whichever way they act, they think, 'Is all right.'<br /> That is the Karma Yoga.<br /> But He has said that: "Whatever karmas you do, whatever its fruits are, that you cannot say." He said it in a very uncertain manner. Because, definitely, if He had said it with certainty, people would never have understood Him. So He said: "It's not possible! That whatever karmas you are doing could be the karmas which will get you the blessings of the Divine." "Karmaṇy-evādhikāras te phaleṣhu mā kadāchana" [mā phaleṣhu" reversed], He has said it.<br /> So then, 'Which karmas we should do? Or should we give up all the karmas? All the action, we should give up?' People were in two minds.<br /> This is the style of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa: is to put people in two minds, so they use their discretion.</font><br /> <b>2001-0729 Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa Pūjā, Ananya Bhakti, Hangar, Nirmal Nagarī, 287 Starkville Road, Fort Plain (5 kms NW of Canajoharie), NY, U.S.A.</b></p><p><br /></p><p> <b>2.55 IAST</b><br /> Śhrī Bhagavān uvācha<br /> prajahāti yadā kāmān sarvān pārtha mano-gatān<br /> ātmany evātmanā tuṣhṭaḥ sthita-prajñas tadochyate</p><p><br /></p><p> <b>2.55 Translations</b><br /> <font color="Peru">When a man, satisfied in the Self alone by himself, completely casts off all the desires of the mind, then is he said to be one of steady knowledge.</font><br /> <font color="blue">The Exalted one Spake "When he, O Son of Pṛthā, renounces all desires lodged in the heart, and is by himself, content within himself, then is he called a man perfectly-poised Discernment.</font><br /> <font color="DarkGreen">When a man surrenders all desires that come to the heart and by the grace of God finds the joy of God, then his soul has indeed found peace.</font></p><p><br /></p><p> <b>2.55 Quotes</b><br /> <font color="DarkRed">So at this time, what is your first job is to try to be more exposed to Me, so that automatically you'll go into your sattvaguṇa. This is the best!<br /> But if I am not there, and when you are alone, or when you are with other Sahaja Yogis, you must now compete in rising higher and higher: from tamoguṇa to rajoguṇa, and from rajoguṇa to sattvaguṇa.<br /> But, actually, by Realization you have gone beyond these three guṇas. You have gone beyond it. Actually that is what has happened to you.<br /> But, like clouds, they cover you again and again.<br /> And when the sky is covered with those clouds, you cannot see the sun, you cannot see the moon, you cannot see the stars.<br /> So we have to know how these clouds are coming into us. And that's how we go into our complete analysis: 'How these clouds are coming to us?'<br /> You find out about our different chakras: 'What are the chakras we are catching?' Here comes the another constant attention towards our chakras. 'Are our vibrations all right or not? Are we getting our vibrations? If not, what chakra am I catching? What must be the catch? I must raise my Kuṇḍalinī, see for myself, where is the catch. Do I do my meditation or not? If I do it, am I doing it just dozingly or am I ... am I really in it? Am I really feeling it or not? Am I alert or not?'<br /> All this is to be assiduously, sincerely, absolutely, truthfully should be worked out. Because it is a process between your Self: "Ātmane evātmanā tuṣhṭaḥ." You see, it's so very funny, it is so funny relationship: that it is the Ātmā is satisfied with Ātmā! You have to be satisfied with your Self.<br /> There's nobody, Mātājī is not concerned, nobody is concerned.

Those who cannot see, cannot see." "Yata [yaḥ] paśhyati, sa paśhyati." "The one who cannot see, cannot see." Is a simple thing.<br /> But to a normal human being, he can't understand, that, 'I can see everything. Why can't I see? I see the colors, I see the room, I see everything.'<br /> Now how ... why [it] is said, "That those who can see, can see, and those who cannot see, cannot see"? It's a very mysterious statement.</font><br /> <b>1980-0717 Public Program, Seeking Is the Force that Drives Us, Northampton, UK</b><br /> ......</p><div class="para-divider"></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <b>Chapter 6</b><br /> <font color="blue"><b>Ātma Saṃyama Yoga</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <b>Chapter 7</b><br /> <font color="blue"><b>Jñāna Vijñāna Yoga</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <b>Chapter 8</b><br /> <font color="blue"><b>Akṣhara Brahma Yoga</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <b>Chapter 9</b><br /> <font color="blue"><b>Rāja Vidyā Rāja Guhya Yoga</b></font></p><p><br /></p><p> <b>9.22 IAST</b><br /> ananyāśh chintayanto māṁ ye janāḥ paryupāsate<br /> teṣhāṁ nityābhiyuktānāṁ yogakṣhemaṁ vahāmyaham m</p><p><br /></p><p> <b>9.22 Translations</b><br /> <font color="Peru">Those men who, meditating on Me as non-separate, worship Me all around, -- to them who are ever devout, I secure gain and safety.</font><br /> <font color="blue">Those people who, thinking on Me with singleness of purpose, offer service unto Me, and who are constantly putting forth effort (in that service); for their sake I take upon myself (the burthen of all) earning, and saving.</font><br /> <font color="DarkGreen">But to those who adore me with pure oneness of soul, to those who are ever in harmony, I increase what they have and I give them what they have not.</font></p><p><br /></p><p> <b>9.22 Quotes</b><br /> <font color="DarkRed">We sometimes ask for worldly things, power, money: you are still entangled in little things.<br /> The Supreme Self that I am talking of is all seeing.

But you must do bhakti which is ananya."<br /> Now if you know Sanskrit, ananya: when you are not the other. When you are a realized Soul!<br /> If you are not connected, what is the bhakti on you? Many people complain: "Mother, I have been fasting, I have been doing this, I did this, and see my condition. I've become a nervous wreck." Is not the mistake of God: you are not yet connected.<br /> Is-s, simple thing like a telephone: is [if] the telephone is not connected, wha[t']s the use of telephoning? You spoil the telephone.<br /> So, bhakti without the connection is wrong. That's why Kṛiṣhṇa has said it: "Yogakṣhemaṁ vahāmyaham": "First Yog, then kṣhema." First you must achieve your Yoga, and then your benevolence will come. Otherwise, it won't work out.<br /> Very subtly He has put Yoga first. Why didn't He say, 'Kṣhema-yoga'?<br /> So, for bhakti He said like this.</font><br /> <b>1991-1206 Public Program, Day 1, Narada Gana Sabha, 254 Mowbrays Road, Alwarpet, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India</b><br /> ......</p><p><br /></p><p> <b>9.26 IAST</b><br /> patraṃ puṣhpaṃ phalaṃ toyaṃ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati<br /> tad ahaṃ bhakty-upahṛtam aśhnāmi prayatātmanaḥ</p><p><br /></p><p> <b>9.26 Translations</b><br /> <font color="Peru">When one offers to Me with devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit, water, -- that I eat, offered with devotion by the pure-minded.</font><br /> <font color="blue">A leaf, a flower, a fruit, (even) water, whoso offers unto Me in devotion: that same, proffered in devotion by one whose soul is pure, I accept.</font><br /> <font color="DarkGreen">He who offers to me with devotion only a leaf, or a flower, or a fruit, or even a little water, this I accept from that yearning soul, because with a pure heart it was offered with love.</font></p><p><br /></p><p> <b>9.26 Quotes</b><br /> <font color="blue"></font><br /> <b></b></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <b>Chapter 10</b><br /> <font color="blue"><b>Vibhūti Yoga</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <b>Chapter 11</b><br /> <font color="blue"><b>Viśhwarūpa Darśhana Yoga</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <b>Chapter 12</b><br /> <font color="blue"><b>Bhakti Yoga</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <b>Chapter 13</b><br /> <font color="blue"><b>Kṣhetra Kṣhetragñya Yoga</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <b>Chapter 14</b><br /> <font color="blue"><b>Guṇatraya Vibhāga Yoga</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <b>Chapter 15</b><br /> Chapter 15<br /> <font color="blue"><b>Puruṣhottama Yoga</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <b>Chapter 16</b><br /> <font color="blue"><b>Daivāsura Sampad Vibhāga Yoga</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <b>Chapter 17</b><br /> <font color="blue"><b>Śhraddhātaya Vibhāga Yoga</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <b>Chapter 18</b><br /> <font color="blue"><b>Mokṣha Saṃnyāsa Yoga</b></font></p><p><br /></p><p> <b>18.66 IAST</b><br /> sarva-dharmān parityajya Mām ekaṃ śharaṇaṃ vraja<br /> ahaṃ tvāṃ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣhayiṣhyāmi mā śhuchaḥ</p><p><br /></p><p> <b>18.66 Translations</b><br /> <font color="Peru">Abandoning all righteous deeds, seek me as thy sole Refuge; I will liberate thee from all sins; do thou not grieve.</font><br /> <font color="blue">Relinquish all (so-called) 'duties', and unto Me alone as shelter, betake thyself: I shall release thee from all 'sins' whatsoever.</font><br /> <font color="DarkGreen">Leave all things behind, and come to me for thy salvation.

"Forget about all your dharmas." Dharma means in His meaning that we have a dharma of a wife, of a husband, of a uh-uh-uh-uh member of the society, all of them have their own dharma. But He says, "Leave them! And leave it them to Me, and I'll manage."<br /> This is it, we have to learn: is to say that, 'Is this Divine Power which will solve our problems.'<br /> As human beings, it's a very difficult state.<br /> And this state only can be achieved through meditation. But I am say... not saying that you go on meditating for hours altogether: not necessary. But with full faith in yourself and in the Divine Power, if you work it out, I'm sure, is not difficult to rise to that state of consciousness. </font><br /> <b>1998-0510 Sahasrāra Pūjā, Blessing of the Divine Pours Only if the Sahasrāra is Open (Meditation Is the Only Way You Can Enrich Yourself with the Beauty of Reality), Hangar, Cabella Ligure, Alessandria, Italy</b></p><p><br /></p><p style="color:red;">Jay Śhrī Mātājī!<br /></p></section><footer class="page__meta"></footer><nav class="pagination"> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/scriptures/2022/0605" class="pagination--pager" title="Post 6: Up-date ">Previous</a> <a href="#" class="pagination--pager disabled">Next</a></nav></div></article></div><script src="https://seven-teams.github.io/assets/js/main.min.js"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', '', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script src="https://unpkg.com/vanilla-back-to-top@7.2.1/dist/vanilla-back-to-top.min.js"></script> <script>addBackToTop()</script></body></html>
