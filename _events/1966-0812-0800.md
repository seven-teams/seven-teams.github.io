Quote from 1983-0927 Public Program, Day 3, First United Church of Hollywood, 69817 Franklin Avenue, Los Angeles, CA, U.S.A.:</b> <i>"I went to Japan once, and they were having a[n] Ikebana competition [laughing:] or something, so I went to see the Ikebana class. Thes [they] requested Me: "Why don't You do some flower arrangement?" I said, "All right, I'll do it!" I did it, and I got the highest [laughing:] marks without knowing a word about Ikebana. Just surprising: I got the highest mark.<br>
I can do lots of things which I have never done before like architecture. I have built houses without being doing any architecture. I have done decorations of the houses, I have done all kinds of things without knowing how to it.<br>
Because you become you so creative."</i></list-item>
