  <list-item color="BlanchedAlmond" width="280"><b>Q1:</b> <i>So unless and until you touch your depth, you'll become like any other religion, because you won't be actually Sahaja Yogis, just nominal.<br>
So we have to work in such a manner, that: we understand ourselves and we understand our attention and we try to ascend. I don't have to tell you: you yourself have to work it out in such a manner that you touch your depth and you become an ascetic within yourself. Then only you will be really uh doing the divine work properly, with proper understanding.<br>
Sahaja Yoga is the integration of all these Great Prophets and these Incarnations. So, I have to tell you that, whatever were your conditionings and all that, to get rid of them, you must get out of this Ocean of Illusion.</i></list-item>
