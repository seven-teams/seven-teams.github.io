The stuffed animals were on Shri Mataji's bed pillow.<br>
During the conversation, it was said that we [Catherine and Patrick] were ready to expand the family; then Shri Mataji looked at Cathy, raised Her eyes to the sky and remained fixed on Cathy to whom She offered a tapestry of Shri Ganesha that was on Her bed table."</list-item>
