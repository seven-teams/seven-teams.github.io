Shri Mataji has put Her attention for a long time on this place and on the events that took place there.<br>
As this day was my birthday, I had the immense joy of receiving from Mother this charming heart-shaped porcelain box."</list-item>

Extract from the 2025-1000 pdf file 'Lille September 1980' of Catherine Paillusseau:</b> "On April 18th, we went to visit the Château de Versailles and have a picnic in the gardens. Shri Mataji spoke about the fact that the French Revolution was not a good thing because it was easier for the Divine to work out things through a king rather than through a president appointed temporarily by the people."</list-item>
