  <list-item color="BlanchedAlmond" width="280"><b>Q1:</b> <i>And I'm so happy I'm in London because, I find, in London people are really very much balanced. There's some sort of a force which I know already is there, which has worked, that people are balanced. There's some sort of a limiting force which makes them understand that they have to be in the c-c-center. And so many of them, I've met here, are really very beautiful people. </i></list-item>
  <list-item color="Lavender" width="280"><b>Q2:</b> <i>I came here because you wanted it. Because there was a force which worked it out. That's why I'm here: at your disposal and at your service.</i></list-item>
  <list-item color="BlanchedAlmond" width="280"><b>Q3:</b> <i>Again and again, I bless you with all My heart: that God should give you wisdom to choose the path of reality and work in His Kingdom, to be in His pattern, and to be in His whole organization, to give up our value structure and to accept His value structure.</i></list-item>
