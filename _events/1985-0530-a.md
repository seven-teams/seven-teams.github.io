Śhrī Mātājī went shopping, and some of us met at the designated restaurant where we were all to eat. As Śhrī Mātājī and those accompanying Her didn't arrive for some time, some leader sent me out to look for Her. I wandered around the shops for a while with the feeling that my search was unnecessary, as Śhrī  Ādi Śhakti would come at the perfect time anyway. And sure enough, when I returned She was there enjoying Her meal with the others."</list-item>
