Quote from 1985-0901 Talk to Sahaja Yogis of Belgium and Netherlands, before Departure after Śhrī Viṣhṇumāyā Pūjā, Southlands College, University of Roehampton, Wimbledon, London, UK:</b> <i>"Then [in 1964] I went to Hamburg, and in Hamburg there was a hundred years of the Hamburg boats [775 Years of Hamburg Hafen (Harbor)]. So they had a huge, big, uh-uh-uh uh, what you call them, eh-eh-eh ... celebration uh with crackers and a lot of these fireworks, all kinds of things, which was a tremendous uh idea. And we all were on a river [Elbe], on a boat, and from there we could see these. I've never seen such fireworks! Things used to break into trees, into flowers, into fruits, everything, their fire, you know? They'd made it such special ones. So that happened in Hamburg."</i></list-item>
