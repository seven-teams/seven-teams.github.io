  <list-item color="BlanchedAlmond"  width="280"><b>R1. Extract from the 2025-1000 pdf file 'Lille September 1980' of Catherine Paillusseau:</b> "Shri Mataji resided at the Hotel Bellevue. The room overlooked the place du General de Gaulle, called Grand Place. On this square, there is a big column topped by a statue. Shri Mataji laughed when She knew that the statue was called the Goddess. So I was staying with Mother and I remember that being at Her feet, She authorized me to put my head on Her lap. While doing so, I asked Her to forgive me for the mistakes made in this life and in previous lives. Shri Mataji told me that mistakes were part of the past. What was important was to face ourselves and to stay in the present. She said that when we overcome a difficulty, we help other human beings who have the same profile."</list-item>
