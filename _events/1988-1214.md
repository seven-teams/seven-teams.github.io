  <list-item color="BlanchedAlmond" width="280"><b>R1. 1989-0220 Email from Sarvesh Paulo to a Sahaja Yoga email group (Edward Saugstad Collection):</b> "On December 14th, the tour buses arrived at the outskirt of Pune. ...... Our tents were set up at Bhugao, Matarwadi Phata. This place is only 20 minutes away from the city.<br>
There was a Craft Exhibition at Pune when we arrived; we were taken to the exhibition in the afternoon. Of all the shopping places in the whole India tour, I think this was the best we have come to. Shri Mataji was there earlier and we found her signatures in the special-quest-book where She signed "Mataji Nirmala Devi"."</list-item>
