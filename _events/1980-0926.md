  <list-item color="BlanchedAlmond" width="280"><b>Q1:</b> <i>Now I have found out: that Western people waste so much of their energy in decision-making. And what are the decisions you have made, so far? Like, 'What food should we have?'<br>
'What does it become ultimately, all the food that you decide to eat?' Same about our lives. 'When we think and try to plan our lives, what do we make out of it? What is the ultimate result of our life?', we should think.<br>
Because of this ego orientation, this decision-making is there. I'm amazed: how this decision-making about food has started!</i></list-item>
  <list-item color="Lavender" width="280"><b>Q2:</b> <i>Please take decision-making at zero. Say, 'I do not take any decision. I will not take any decision. Let Mother take the decision.' This is the way you can do it.</i></list-item>  
  <list-item color="BlanchedAlmond" width="280"><b>Q3:</b> <i>You better all sit down and quietly meditate within yourself. And work it out, properly. Your vibrations should be all right, that's the main point is.</i></list-item>
