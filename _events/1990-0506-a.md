  <list-item color="BlanchedAlmond" width="280"><b>Q1:</b> <i>Sahaja Yoga is not by the way.<br>
......<br>
So Sahaja Yoga is a commitment. Is a commitment and complete involvement. Otherwise you are really useless for Sahaja Yoga, absolutely useless. Is better to have few people who are committed than to have thousands who are just useless.<br>
So, let us see what you have decided for yourself and what you have decided for Sahaja Yoga. If you have decided to opt for Sahaja Yoga, then just know that this is the main thing which you have to do. The whole attention should be on that.</i></list-item>
