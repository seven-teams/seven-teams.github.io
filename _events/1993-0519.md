  <list-item color="BlanchedAlmond"  width="280"><b>R1. 2024-0208 from Adrian Vasiu:</b> "The Sufi Quarter ws far away from where Romanian and other Sahaja Yogis were accommodated. As we were so many, walking was the only option. While walking, the Romanian leader lost the way several times, so a few times we started walking pretty much in the opposite direction. It was a great experience of surrendering by just following and walking with no reaction, after all we were already so much blessed during the last 3 days of being with Śhrī Mātājī  in Istanbul. We eventually reached the place. We also got the chance to dance, and, a few Sahaja Yogis, who had some familiarity with the Sufi whirling, surprised Śhrī Mātājī, and She very sweetly encouraged them to whirl."</list-item>
