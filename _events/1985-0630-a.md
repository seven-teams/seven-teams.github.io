Extract from the 2025-1000 pdf file 'Lille 1981 & 1980' of Patrick Lantoin:</b> "As I was driving Shri Mataji to Versailles for the inauguration of the French version of The Advent (June 30, 1985), Sir CP, who accompanied Her, asked me a question. In substance he said: "Was it easy for you to accept Sahaja Yoga?"<br>
My response was spontaneous and quite simple: "It was obvious!", which made Shri Mataji laugh and She made the following comment to Her husband: "You see!" "</list-item>
