  <list-item color="Lavender" width="280"><b>C2. 2023-0722 WhatsApp message to Mrs. Kalpana Srivastava:</b> "The SCI was formed on Oct. 2, 1961. That's why its Annual General Meetings have taken place around the end of September. Searched the internet: got Sir C.P.'s speeches from Sept. 21, 1967 and Sept. 28, 1968. Also, from 1997 to 2020 all AGMs were at the end of September or exceptionally very early October. Couldn't get more, but this is very relevant.<br>
So, used the end of Sept. 1962 for the 12th AGM of SCI for the event with Minister Ram."</list-item>
