I don’t remember the year. Standing next to PK is Ashok Varma and standing next to me is Sarita, Ashok’s wife. Standing next to Sarita is Vinita Mathur - all very good friends of mine and PK. Mummy was very fond of them, and had invited them for my birthday. Mummy would always come to Mumbai to celebrate my birthday. The sari I am wearing was bought by her for me. While buying it she had told me that this was a NILAMBARI from Benares, a muslin with real silver thread woven into it."</list-item>
