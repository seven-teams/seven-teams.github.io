Extract from the 2025-1000 pdf file 'Lille September 1980' of Catherine Paillusseau:</b> "During a nap in the bedroom of Marie, Mother had dozed off, at least I thought so, because Mother was lightly snoring. I was lying at the foot of the bed when somebody opened the door and I told him to be careful as Shri Mataji was sleeping. At that precise moment, Mother opened Her eyes and said: "Cathy, If I was asleep, the world would collapse." "</list-item>
