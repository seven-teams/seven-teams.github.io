  <list-title color="DarkSeaGreen" width="55">Key Quotes</list-title>
  <list-item color="BlanchedAlmond" width="280"><b>Q1:</b> <i>I have told them, in Marathi language because most of them are Maharashtrians here, that in every part of the country one has to work hard and one has to spread Sahaja Yoga with complete dedication and understanding. That today is the day for us to achieve that power, to absorb that power by which we are going to spread Sahaja Yoga all over the world.<br>
It's you who can enlighten other people. It's you who can show them the path and it's you who can bring forth this new transformation which has been promised thousands of years back.</i></list-item>
  <list-item color="Lavender" width="280"><b>Q2:</b> <i>When we try to play games with ourselves, we miss the point because it is the Self which is going to emit. It is the Self that is going to give you your glory. It is the Self which is going to bestow all the blessings of Divine Love and all the securities and all the help that is deserved by you.</i></list-item>
  <list-item color="BlanchedAlmond" width="280"><b>Q3:</b> <i>You have to face yourself clearly and you have to see yourself because your Self is the beauty, is the glory, is everything for you. Your Self is the most important thing and if you have to deceive yourself then what will you get in Sahaja Yoga? It is the waste of time for you and Me.</i></list-item>
  <list-item color="Lavender" width="280"><b>Q4:</b> <i>Here you don't have to sacrifice anything. You are blessed, even if you come once to My program, you are blessed. Even you once take My name, you are blessed. Even you once see My Photograph, you are blessed, free, free, free of charge.</i></list-item>
  <list-item color="BlanchedAlmond" width="280"><b>Q5:</b> <i>So, we have to put our life fixed for something that is noble, enlightening and higher.</i></list-item>
  <list-item color="Lavender" width="280"><b>Q6:</b> <i>So, I have to request you to all that face yourself, love yourself, respect yourself, understand yourself and stand on your self-respect and see for yourself that you are the king of kings, that you are the one who is to be worshiped. You are the one who is the Emblem of God's Love.<br>
Such a beautiful thing it is, you see, so many of you are enlightened and settled down so well in Sahaja Yoga, enjoying the blessings, all the time. But, still, we have to progress far more.<br>
For that, what you have to do is to just meditate and meditate every day, regularly, religiously, like it is the pūjā of your Self. You are worshiping your own Self. With humility, with surrender of your ego, you are worshiping your Self. You are not degrading it, you are not analyzing it, but you are absorbing the beautiful power and the light of your Ātmā into your attention.</i></list-item>
  <list-item color="BlanchedAlmond" width="280"><b>Q7:</b> <i>May God bless you this day when you all be full of light and full of understanding of Sahaja Yoga and may be in the bliss of Complete Understanding and Love of God.</i></list-item>
