  <list-item color="BlanchedAlmond" width="280"><b>Q1:</b> <i>So today, again a day of great determination, and taking a vow: that, 'For us, our ascent is the only concern, is the only idea.' Nothing else! And it will work out. All the rest will be taken care of. You have all the mechanics to do that. But first, give it to the mechanics to work out. All will work in a reflex action.<br>
Clear! Clear out your chakras! Don't say, 'I have this, I have that'! Just clear out! 'How dare I have all these problems? How dare I have all these chakras still lingering?' Clear out! Morning, evening, clear out!<br>
I'm sure it will work out.<br>
Next year, I hope I'll have some good news. </i></list-item>
