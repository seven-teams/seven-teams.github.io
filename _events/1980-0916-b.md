  <list-item color="BlanchedAlmond" width="280"><b>R1. Extract from the 2025-1000 pdf file 'Lille September 1980' of Catherine Paillusseau:</b> "The public program took place in the afternoon in a meeting room at la maison des métiers et de l'artisanat, rue Nationale, very near the hotel where Shri Mataji was staying. Around 30 people were present. The programme was not recorded but I remember that Shri Mataji pointed out the pleasant character of the town and of its inhabitants. She described the autonomic nervous system, the Kundalini and the importance of the Spirit above all. At the end of the programme, Mother worked on some of the new people.<br>
One of my friends came to the programme with a journalist from "the Voix du Nord" which is the most important newspaper in the area. I was disappointed when he told me that because of the subject (Self-Realization and the Spirit in us), he could not write an article for the newspaper as he would lose his job if he did so."</list-item>

Quote from 1980-0926 Talk to Sahaja Yogis, On Āśhram and Prayer, Āśhram, 44 Chelsham Road, Clapham, London, UK:</b> <i>"Now, first I want to tell you what happened where I went, and how we got lots of Sahaja Yogis all over. That's a very good news.<br>
The first thing was, I went to Lille, where you know Cathy is doing the organizing. She's a very sensible person. And her father is somehow little bit opposed to Sahaj Yog, but mother is not. And she called Me to her place for lunch."</i></list-item>
