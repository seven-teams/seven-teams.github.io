Mummy said that TAARINI is the Goddess who gives you moksha. She ferries you from your life on earth to eternal moksha, which is the Adishakti.<br> 
Please spell TAARINI as TAARINI. Mummy had specially asked me to spell it with a double A, so that there was no confusion with the pronunciation of the name."</list-item>
