  <list-item color="BlanchedAlmond" width="280"><b>Q1:</b> <i>If Sahaja Yoga can be carried for ten centuries, this world will be a different place.<br>
So one has to learn that we have to dedicate. We must fully dedicate ourself.</i></list-item>
  <list-item color="Lavender" width="280"><b>Q2:</b> <i>Committed means-s-s: 'Even if we have to give our life we should do it. Even if we have to give up everything, we should do it.'</i></list-item>
  <list-item color="BlanchedAlmond" width="280"><b>Q3:</b> <i>And when this commitment will start, I'm sure Sahaja Yoga will spread like anything.</i></list-item>
  <list-item color="Lavender" width="280"><b>Q4:</b> <i>And without commitment purity cannot come in. Will go up and down like a yo-yo.<br>
We are committed to Sahaja Yoga! If there are even five people who are really, fully committed to Sahaja Yoga, it can be built up that way.</i></list-item>
  <list-item color="BlanchedAlmond" width="280"><b>Q5:</b> <i>All those who are wise will take to this and understand that the life is only worth this. Otherwise it's useless, is good for nothing, it has no meaning. And this has to come from, first from the leaders, and then from others: complete commitment to Sahaja Yoga.<br>
It doesn't mean that you have to give up anything. For My sake you don't have to do anything. But for your own sake, for your own betterment, you have to do it.<br>
I hope next time when you come to India you will be coming better prepared for commitments.<</i></list-item>
  <list-item color="Lavender" width="280"><b>Q6:</b> <i>Now, all this is for your good, for your benevolence, that you get all the blessings. But that doesn't mean that you should stagnate, that you should not progress. One has to progress higher and higher.<br>
One has to decide the commitment: 'I have committed to Sahaja Yoga.' And that is what you have to be committed [to].</i></list-item>
