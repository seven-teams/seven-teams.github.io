  <list-item color="BlanchedAlmond" width="280"><b>Q1: 1980-0814 Public Program, Finding Out the Truth, Preston, Lancashire, UK</b> <i>There was one very good guru in uh Bengal, and I asked him, "Why don't you go to America?" And within three days he returned back from New York. He told Me, "Nothing doing! I am going back home. I am not going to work out with these people, I have no patience. They are very ignorant! They don't want the Truth. They want some sort of a circus. Let them have the circus."</i></list-item>
