Quote from 1995-0929 Meta Modern Era, Chapter 11: The Subtle System:</b> "Once we were traveling from London to Paris via the hover craft and we started our journey from Calais. At Lille, we found the houses were all closed at about seven thirty in the evening. We had lost our way, so we knocked at the door of every house which had lights on and we found a drunk man coming out of it or a lady who was completely drunk at the front door to answer our call. They were so drunk that we couldn't ask them anything. But we just thought it would be better to go to some pub to find our way out. But even they could not tell us where the village pub was. It was a very difficult task to talk to anyone after nine o'clock in that place, which was supposed to be a very fashionable part of France."</list-item>
