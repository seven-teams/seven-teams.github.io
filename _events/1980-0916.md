Quote from 1980-0926 Talk to Sahaja Yogis, On Āśhram and Prayer, Āśhram, 44 Chelsham Road, Clapham, London, U:</b> "<i>Now, first I want to tell you what happened where I went, and how we got lots of Sahaja Yogis all over. That's a very good news.<br>
The first thing was, I went to Lille, where you know Cathy is doing the organizing. She's a very sensible person. And her father is somehow little bit opposed to Sahaj Yog, but mother is not. And she called Me to her place for lunch.</i>"</list-item>
