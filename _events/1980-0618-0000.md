Quote from 1983-0304 Pūjā, Mother You Be in Our Brain, Rented House, Adelaide, SA, Australia:</b> <i>In England, they invited Me ah to launch one ship. And another to, they called it 'Naming the ship' but that was also another launching, in one day.<br>
Now, they were told that they have to make a swastika on the ship.<br>
So the first ship, they made a swastika with a stencil like that. And on the sh... other ship they turned it around and made the other swastika, you see.<br>
So, as first ship I launched, on second ship I saw, I said, "This swastika is not all right, it's the other way around." "Oooh." And they got such a fright! They said, "It is inauspicious! Is it inauspicious?", and they were so [laughing:] worried. I said, "Doesn't matter! Now change it over."<br>
So they removed all that, painted it up, and just put another swastika like that. So sweet.<br>
They were so much worried, I was amazed!</i></list-item>
