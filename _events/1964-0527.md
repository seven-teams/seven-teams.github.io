Quote from 1979-0114 Public Program (Hindi), Day 1, Satya kā Anveṣhaṇa (Exploration of Truth), Biralā Krīṛā Keṃdra, Chowpatty, Girgaum Chowpatty, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India:</b> <i>"When I first went to England in nineteen sixty-five [1965 (1964)], I wondered whether that country was under some calamity. Such a cold wind, such snow, sharp piercing wind, gets inside your body and pokes all over and fills the body with pain. People cover themselves with heavy capes and then only can they move. Then only you can go out. No one can live under a tree in London. No one can live in huts in London. You cannot sit in your house unless it is heated."</i></list-item>

So, in the beginning it was a shock! Not to see, 'What's happening? Is he all right?' Is gone mad or what is he doing about that?' [Laughter.] You could not accept it, is the way, it is really for old people like Me [laughter]. It was a shock to see the way people were holding on to it and, "Ho, ho, ho," [as laughter starts:] and the other people were shaking their legs like this and shaking like that, so they were going like that. One was raising the head.<br>
The, this was the first show we, I saw, I think about uh sixty-five ['65 ('64)] when I came here."</i></list-item>

First I went in sixty-five ['65 ('64)')], then it was good, but the hippies things has started. And by the time it was '70, I think, it was at the peak of the hippie era, where I picked up seven pickies ... pi... hippies. [Laughs.]<br>
