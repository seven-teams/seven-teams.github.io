   <list-item color="Lavender"  width="280"><b>R2. :</b> "We went for lunch at my parents' house, rue de Bourgogne (Burgundy street). My father couldnâ€™t be there so my mother welcomed Shri Mataji. I remember that we had a small dog who looked like a fox and he was usually sticking to my mother. But when Shri Mataji sat on the sofa, he rushed literally towards Her and he curled up in the folds of Her silk sari. I tried to pull him back but Shri Mataji told me, "Let him there, he knows who I am." "</list-item>
