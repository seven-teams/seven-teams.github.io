  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;"NEW DELHI, Jan. 28.<br> 
&emsp; Sahaj Yogis under the banner of Life Eternal Trust today staged a peace march in the capital which culminated at the Prime Minister's residence at Lodi Road.<br>
&emsp; The Yogis, followers of Her Holiness Sri Mataji Nirmala Devi, alleged that their movement for human upliftment and brotherhood has recently been victim of violent attacks and vandalism at the hands of the "Andh Shraddha Nirmoolan Samiti" in Maharashtra.<br>
&emsp; Alleging indifference on the part of the police, possibly with political connivance, the Yogis said the FIR lodged by them has not been pursued. A silent march taken out by them in Bombay two weeks ago did not get any response from the authorities. On the other hand, some adherents were victimized, harassed and arrested, a memorandum submitted to the Prime Minister's residence said. They demanded Central Government's intervention in the matter as according to them the Maharashtra Chief Minister and his brother were allegedly behind the floating of the Samiti, the memorandum said. — Our Staff Reporter"</list-item>

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; NEW DELHI, Jan. 28<br> 
  &emsp; Several hundred members of the Life Eternal Trust known as Sahaj Yogis undertook a peace march to the Prime Minister's house today to draw his attention to the alleged harassment meted out to them by unruly elements enjoying the patronage of Maharashtra Chief Minister Sharad Pawar.<br>
<br>
  &emsp; A spokesman of the trust said the harassment amounted to denial of the fundamental right to worship and practice faith as per one's conviction. He said they were harassed in public in Maharashtra with the connivance of the local administration and today's demonstration aimed to draw the attention of the Central Government to the "lawlessness prevailing in that State, endangering the safety of peaceful, law-abiding persons there".<br>
<br>
  &emsp; The spokesman alleged that Mr Sharad Pawar's brother Pratap Pawar recently floated an organization called Andh Shrad[d]ha Nirmoolan Samiti (ASNS). The members of that organization were disturbing the Sahaj Yoga programs of the trust in Maharashtra in the recent weeks."</list-item>

&emsp;   "The Sahaj Yogis, followers of Her Holiness Nirmala Devi, who started the Life Eternal Trust, staged a silent march in New Delhi on Sunday to draw the attention of the Prime Minister towards the manner in which they were being denied the right to practice their ' faith.<br>
 <br>
 &emsp; They had staged a similar march in Bombay, earlier this month, protesting against "some unruly elements who with the blessings of the Maharashtra Chief Minister" not only harassed them but disrupted their meetings.<br>
<br>
&emsp; The Sahaj Yogis adhere to fundamental values such as absolute morality in personal life, honesty in public life, dedication to peaceful co-existence and complete adherence to truth and universal brotherhood. Alcohol, drugs and tobacco find no place in their lives."</list-item>

&emsp;  "(by our office correspondent)<br>
&emsp; Today Sahaj Yogis did a peace march to Prime Minister's residence for depriving them from doing Pūjā and follow their dharma according to their desires which is their fundamental right.<br>
&emsp; Sahaj Yogis allegation is against Chief Minister of Maharashtra that he is depriving them of their rights. The allegation of Sahaj Yogis is that not only with the help of police some goons tried to trouble them personally but they created problems in public programs too."</list-item>

 "The Prime Minister's residence at Lodhi Estate witnessed a silent demonstration by Sahaj Yogis of the Life Eternal Trust, on Sunday. The Yogis, including women and children, were the followers of Mataji Nirmala Devi, who is known for her teachings regarding the awakening of Kundalini from one's self thus realizing truth.<br>
&emsp; The demonstration was in protest against the alleged attacks on the Mataji's supporters by a section of people in Maharashtra. She was addressing a gathering in Sātārā. The Yogis alleged that some people led by Pratap Pawaar, Maharashtra Chief Minister Sharad Pawar['s] brother with the support of their organization 'Andh Shrad[d]ha Nirmoolan Samiti's had disrupted Mataji's meeting in Sātārā. It was reported that 21 were seriously injured and had to be admitted in the Sātārā Civil Hospital.<br>
&emsp; Though an FIR was lodged with the Sātārā police on December 29, '89, day of the alleged attack, no further actions were taken by the authorities, maintained the Trust members."</list-item>
