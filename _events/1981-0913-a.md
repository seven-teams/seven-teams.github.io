Recollection of Antoinette Wells from the Book 'Eternally Inspired Recollections of Our Divine Mother', Volume 1, Page 284:</b> "The next day at the airport in Paris before leaving She spoke like Christ, as what She was saying was like the Sermon on the Mount. Once again I was translating Her and I got very moved because when She spoke about love it was exactly an answer to my silent prayer of the day before."</list-item>
