Dear Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginīs,<br>
<br>
Our subteam has started contributing to the Archives of the database via specific posts (so far 5 pdf files in 2 specific posts, on Divine Cool Breeze Magazine and on Letters and Press Releases) and via the table at the link <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/archives/table.html"> <font color="blue"><b>Data Table</b></font></a>, which currently has 1,280 rows and which is projected that in due time will have a number of rows between 4,000 and 21,000.
