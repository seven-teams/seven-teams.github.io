The main reasons for moving from Chronology Folder to Collections Folder are the flexibility of photographers/collectors to choose between downloadable and non-downloadable and the decision of not making the two XYZ Collections downloadable.Second, we would like to reiterate our expectation that all Photos downloaded from Eternal Moments will be exclusively used for worshiping and for the well-established Sahaja Yoga Projects, by which we mean projects which THROUGHOUT the history of Sahaja Yoga have been regarded as Sahaja Yoga Projects. Among these projects we explicitly mention the spreading of Sahaja Yoga via Public Programs or publications or dedicated, well-organized websites that have full self-control on their promotions. In particular, we do not regard websites or accounts that are either non-dedicated or are not well-organized or are promoted by third parties or mixed with other promotions as well-established Sahaja Yoga projects and as such our team would be very grateful to everyone if we could all refrain from downloading Photos and photos Moments of Joy and re-uploading them to such websites and accounts.The first and foremost protocol is towards our Divine Mother. Her Photos are so precious that their handling and sharing ought to be governed by sheer love, gratitude, owe, responsibility, and delicate feelings. We would like to suggest the constant inquiry: &#39;What I intend to do with a Photo, would I have been very comfortable doing it in Her Divine Presence?&#39;Next protocol is towards the photographers, their names, when known, show up in the titles of the Photos in the form &quot;(Photo credit Name)&quot;. In any usage of the Photos, credit to the photographers, the artists to whom we are very grateful for being able to enjoy these remarkable Photos, is a standard requirement in any art, regulated by well established copyrights, and in complete accordance to Sahaja Culture and the family spirit of brothers and sisters that makes Sahaja Yoga unique.Next protocol is towards the collectors, their names, when known, show up in the titles of the Photos in the form &quot;(Name Collection)&quot;. In any usage of the Photos, credit to the collectors is strongly suggested, especially as in many cases the collectors are in fact the photographers (who could not be fully confirmed). Between making the mistake of listing a wrong photographer and the mistake of listing a photographer just as a collector, the former is a more serious and unpleasant mistake, and as such our team makes every effort to avoid it.Last protocol, our subteam would like to continue on this project for many-many years and, as such, your support, your acknowledgement, and your appreciation would be very helpful and truly appreciated.We would like to suggest not to change the titles of the Photos downloaded from Eternal Moments. Please note down that a huge amount of time has been invested in the research, communications, sequencing, dating and placing in order to produce the titles.We would also like to suggest providing links to galleries of Eternal Moments from where the Photos have been downloaded.When the format of Photos is changed into new formats, such as print or film format, we suggest to include appropriate credits at the end of the new formats.If certain websites have a certain style of caption, then we suggest uploading the Photo with the original title and use the own style of caption while adding next to caption the suggested credits and/or links.If previously a Photo has been extracted from Eternal Moments using copy and save and it is now downloadable, please kindly make an effort to replace it by the downloaded version as it ought to be of a higher resolution. In this way, undesirable versions are as well avoided/eliminated.Finally, if a downloaded Photo has a size too big for a certain purpose, then please kindly use the save or copy version that PRESERVES the title.Our current recommendations to the photographers/collectors is &#39;for downloadable&#39;, but this could change in time if by chance inappropriate trends are noticed. Certainly, as much as possible, we would follow closely how the collective will use the downloadable feature. We really hope that together we will show maturity and that our suggestions and expectations will be duly followed and honored.We thank you for your kind understanding and cooperation.Jay Śhrī Mātājī!The Photo Subteamsahajayoga.compilations@gmail.comhttps://linktr.ee/comprehensivecompilationsteam"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2023-09-11T00:00:00-04:00"> <script type="application/ld+json"> { "@context" : "http://schema.org", "@type" : "Person", "name" : "Your Name", "url" : "https://seven-teams.github.io", "sameAs" : null } </script> <!-- end SEO --><link href="https://seven-teams.github.io/feed.xml" type="application/atom+xml" rel="alternate" title="Divine Treasures Feed"> <!-- http://t.co/dKP3o1e --><meta name="HandheldFriendly" content="True"><meta name="MobileOptimized" content="320"><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> <script> document.documentElement.className = document.documentElement.className.replace(/\bno-js\b/g, '') + ' js '; </script> <!-- For all browsers --><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://seven-teams.github.io/assets/css/main.css"><meta http-equiv="cleartype" content="on"> <!-- start custom head snippets --><link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="57x57" href="https://seven-teams.github.io/images/apple-touch-icon-57x57.png?v=M44lzPylqQ"><link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="60x60" href="https://seven-teams.github.io/images/apple-touch-icon-60x60.png?v=M44lzPylqQ"><link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="72x72" href="https://seven-teams.github.io/images/apple-touch-icon-72x72.png?v=M44lzPylqQ"><link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="76x76" href="https://seven-teams.github.io/images/apple-touch-icon-76x76.png?v=M44lzPylqQ"><link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="114x114" href="https://seven-teams.github.io/images/apple-touch-icon-114x114.png?v=M44lzPylqQ"><link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="120x120" href="https://seven-teams.github.io/images/apple-touch-icon-120x120.png?v=M44lzPylqQ"><link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="144x144" href="https://seven-teams.github.io/images/apple-touch-icon-144x144.png?v=M44lzPylqQ"><link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="152x152" href="https://seven-teams.github.io/images/apple-touch-icon-152x152.png?v=M44lzPylqQ"><link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="https://seven-teams.github.io/images/apple-touch-icon-180x180.png?v=M44lzPylqQ"><link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="https://seven-teams.github.io/images/favicon-32x32.png?v=M44lzPylqQ" sizes="32x32"><link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="https://seven-teams.github.io/images/android-chrome-192x192.png?v=M44lzPylqQ" sizes="192x192"><link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="https://seven-teams.github.io/images/favicon-96x96.png?v=M44lzPylqQ" sizes="96x96"><link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="https://seven-teams.github.io/images/favicon-16x16.png?v=M44lzPylqQ" sizes="16x16"><link rel="manifest" href="https://seven-teams.github.io/images/manifest.json?v=M44lzPylqQ"><link rel="mask-icon" href="https://seven-teams.github.io/images/safari-pinned-tab.svg?v=M44lzPylqQ" color="#000000"><link rel="shortcut icon" href="/images/favicon.ico?v=M44lzPylqQ"><meta name="msapplication-TileColor" content="#000000"><meta name="msapplication-TileImage" content="https://seven-teams.github.io/images/mstile-144x144.png?v=M44lzPylqQ"><meta name="msapplication-config" content="https://seven-teams.github.io/images/browserconfig.xml?v=M44lzPylqQ"><meta name="theme-color" content="#ffffff"><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://seven-teams.github.io/assets/css/academicons.css"/> <script type="text/x-mathjax-config"> MathJax.Hub.Config({ TeX: { equationNumbers: { autoNumber: "all" } } }); </script> <script type="text/x-mathjax-config"> MathJax.Hub.Config({ tex2jax: { inlineMath: [ ['$','$'], ["\\(","\\)"] ], processEscapes: true } }); </script> <script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.4/latest.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML' async></script> <!-- end custom head snippets --></head><body> <!--[if lt IE 9]><div class="notice--danger align-center" style="margin: 0;">You are using an <strong>outdated</strong> browser.
