Shri Mataji: Oh! I’ll tell you about that. It’s a very good question. It’s about Hatha Yoga and Raja Yoga. Now, the modern Hatha Yoga is something, I just don’t understand. But Patanjali Shastra, the one who has written “Ha Tha”, that is “Ha” and “Tha” is nothing, but you have these two nadis which these must have described to you. And, there are ashtangas, means there are eight aspects ofHatha Yoga, according to Patanjali who has written it. The most important and the primordial and the first one, is, Ishwara Pranidhana, means the establishment of God within you. Now in these acrobatic things that we do, we have no idea of God, we never talk of it, forget, forget about God, only you have to thin down, that’s all. Because they all want to be actors and actresses you see. They don’t want to be yogis. It’s a different style of things. It was Ishwara Pranidhana, first you must get your Realization. Out of these eight, one is Yama Niyama. In the Niyama, there is only one for physical exercises, that too, depending on where the Kundalini is. We also use Hatha Yoga in a way. Supposing Kundalini is stopping at a point at a certain center due to physical problem, we do a little asanas which are necessary, or some exercise, to do it. But that’s a very different thing. Modern Hatha Yoga is like this: that supposing I have to come from London to Birmingham, all right? I don’t start My car, nothing, but I turn it to the left and the right, standing there, static, you see, and I think I have reached Birmingham. Only I have the map, I’ll go right, left, this thing. Or even worse than that I would give an analogy, it is like taking all the medicines together without knowing what disease you have got. It’s very indiscriminate. None of these teachers have realization - how will they understand the importance of Hatha Yoga I don’t understand. In India, a Guru is the person who is a realized soul. He could be a Muslim, he could be Hindu, he could be anyone, but he has to be a realized soul to begin with. Brahmin is a realized soul. Now these days, these days the Brahmins can be kept as cooks. So the whole concept is so superficial, today’s Hatha Yoga. Then Raja Yoga, is … Now, so you understand Hatha Yoga is a thing. The beginning of Hatha Yoga starts with Sahaja Yoga, where it is established, but Hatha Yoga is a subsidiary thing. Wherever we need, we can use it. Wherever we need, the part of it, we use it. The second part is the Raja Yoga. Raja Yoga is another misconception people have got. That when the Kundalini rises you see, you must see this is a tremendous happening that takes place is the Kundalini rising from that, upwards. It’s not the work of gravity, its moving upwards. So to happen this, there must be some happenings taking place. For example, when it rises, suddenly, you see, when it crosses thesecond center, it goes into a kind of a kind of an augmentation there, so the Kundalini doesn’t fall off. That is called as bandhas. These bandhas, you see the augmentation we can say, the closing of it. Then it goes higher, it starts closing these. It comes to the Vishuddhi Chakra - there the all energy has to be brought into play. So there’s a khechari happens, that the tongue little bit put here. But you won’t feel anything, it’s so fast. It’s so quick you won’t feel it. I mean I cannot give any other analogy like that, that even if you say, ‘Concorde’, I mean you do feel something about it, but supposing if you have a plane that you just board in [Shri Mataji snaps Her fingers) and you are there. Its a split of a second the Kundalini [Shri Mataji snaps Her fingers again] can just shoot off. So you don’t feel any of these things, like, the whole earth is so big, but you don’t see that it’s round. The circumference, in relation to thing that you see, is so small, that you don’t see its round. In the same way, the Sahaja Yoga is such a quick method of Kundalini rising, I mean there’s no other method. But today’s Sahaja Yoga I should say, so fast that you don’t feel anything, but happens. Your eyes also get dilated. But I have seen these mad people called Raja Yogis - they even put atropine in their eyes to dilate their pupils, because is said your eyes must be dilated. They cut out their tongues, push it back. You see there was one in America used to cut out the tongue of the people, used to wag their tongues, even there are now today people affected by this great guru whose tongues are still wagging like this and they used to put back their tongues. Do you mean to say by doing all these tricks you are going to raise the Kundalini? Some hold their thing, there’s nothing tobe done, it is spontaneous. It is effortless. It is in the loving care of God. Why do you want to break your necks for nothing at all? What is the need? I first used to think, like children, you see, when they want to impress their Mother for something, they do these tantrums you see, just to attract the attention of the Mother. But now I think they are very serious about it. It’s most surprising. You’re going to that extent you see, it spoils your chakras. It spoils your position … in Sahaja Yoga, as a good Sahaja Yogi and a bad Sahaja Yogi. A Sahaja Yogi who gets it quick, stationed himself there, and mastered it, is a person who goes very fast, and a person who has ruined his chakras requires attention, or has to take a lot of trouble to improve them, to care for. So all these ideas can be only clarified when you get your Realization. All right?”</p><p>Video References (7:15):</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nK8knTP9r8A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nK8knTP9r8A</a></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DU8UknHahsU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DU8UknHahsU</a></p><p>1982-­0710: <font color="red">Public Program, Day 1, From Mooladhara to Void, Derby, UK</font></p><p>“Recently a girl who is a Sahaja Yogini in New York has cured a blood cancer patient. This boy was about to die. They had declared that “He is going to die.” This declaration they had given: “For about fifteen days,” they said he may live, “and then he is going to die.” I mean that’s the only thing they could do. With all the things poor fellow had gone through, the boy had come from India. All the money was spent, and this was the certificate he got, that he is going to die within fifteen days. Now, somehow these people contacted Me and I told them to contact a Sahaja Yogini in New York. And, they told that “Such and such boy is there, his name is Rahul, he is hardly about sixteen years of age.” He had blood cancer. The boy not only got cured, he came down to London to see Me and he is back in his home. It sounds very fantastic that how can a person who is not a doctor, who has nothing to do with Medicine, can cure. Beyond all these medicines, beyond all these things is thesubtle power, the Divine power from where everything has come from. If you somehow or other become the owner of that or the person who knows how to handle it, you can cure anyone you want to. It’s not that I am curing these days, My disciples are curing. I don’t know how many people this Dr. Warren, who was a doctor, has cured through Sahaja Yoga which is not a medical science. How many patients he, himself, has cured he won’t be able to count. So, the whole system is going tochange. Now you are going to become the master of yourself, of your powers and all these powers are going to be released from you. Now when we say that there were gurus who could cure, there were gurus who could stop a growth of a horrible disease and things like that, we think it’s not possible. We think it’s an impossible thing. How can it be? How can we believe it? It’s a cock and bull story. But you, yourself, when you see manifesting it, you’ll be amazed. Once I was traveling by a ship and the captain of the ship, I gave him Realization. And, it so happened that one of the ship’s staff got into the freezer and he got choked up and he got pneumonia. Of course, I was in a position, I was traveling because My husband was the chairman of that company. So, he would not ask Me to go down. He thought it was too much to ask Me. I said, “All right, if you don’t allow Me to go down. You better go down to the spot where he is. Don’t send an SOS to call a doctor, nothing. You just go and put your hand on his chest for about five minutes.” His pneumonia got cured completely and this captain could not believe it. He said, “How could it be?” I said, “It is. That has happened to you. Now you have become that, accept it.” You must assume that power whatever has been given to you, as in Sanskrit language we say “viraaj.” Assume it. You see, even if you are given a throne, if you don’t know how to assume the power of the throne, to believe into it, then like a beggar boy, if you put him on the throne he still sees people coming down, he puts his hand before, “Give me five rupees. Give me five rupees.” Unless and until you assume these powers you are still uncertain, but you have got them. And this is the point which is very difficult with the western mind specially, because they cannot believe that they can have these powers. They just can’t believe it. You tell them but they say, “How can that be?” But it is so. Now for example, this instrument. If you take it to a village and tell them that this will carry your voices around, or if you take, say, a television set and tell them that you can see all kinds of cinemas or, we can say, a drama and play or music out of this, he is not going to believe it. He will say, “This box? This looks like an ordinary wooden box.” But when you plug in, it shows its powers. In the same way, what you look at human beings as something very, very ordinary mundane thing. For us we take it for granted ourselves. We don’t know how glorified we are, how great we are, how God has created us with such difficulty, with such care, with such love for a very special purpose: that He wants to bestow all His powers upon you. He wants you to enter into the Kingdom of God and to enjoy His blessings, His love. It is something that we cannot believe, we are so frustrated, we are so disgusted with ourselves, with our societies, with everything. But it’s not so, it’s not so. It just has to happen. You are just to be plugged in to the mains and it works and it works. It has worked. It has worked with thousands and it should work with you.”</p><p>Video Reference (5:20):</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUTtaORgAsE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUTtaORgAsE</a></p><p>……<br /> “[Yogi explains the question of a seeker: You said You could cure after Self Realization. His problem is that his mother is deaf.] Can You fix that hearing problem? Shri Mataji: You see this question is such that it makes you feel that I am a person who have to cure everyone. You are sadly mistaken. It’s a by-product of awakening of the Kundalini you get cured. I’m sorry for that, that you have this understanding that I’m here to cure all the people. I should settle down in a hospital? But main thing is Kundalini has to be awakened to get you cured. All right? If your mother was here we could work it out. But the main thing you must understand, that God has lot of common sense as we have, and He’s only interested in such lights as we are which will work out His work. Those who are, say, very sick people, extremely sick, can get cured in a second. You’ll be amazed I tell you. Our President of India, he went to America for his treatment and they failed, and he was going back to India. And, I went to see him as Mrs. So and So. But the High Commissioner told him that I’m So and So and he had heard My name in India. His wife said, “Why don’t you cure my husband?” And, he was just on his last … they had prepared everything for his last rites in India. I just put My hand on his back for ten minutes, you won’t believe. He had not slept for days together with pain. He said, “My pain is relieved. I want to sleep.” And, he got up, he was perfectly all right. He walked down, people had brought stretchers and things. He just walked down. They couldn’t believe their eyes. But this has happened because he is going to be used for the work of God. In our house if you have lights which are never going to give light, we don’t bother about them. We sell them in the junk. In the same way, the Divine doesn’t cure people, all of them. It does many thousands but some of the people who are very sick, He says, “All right. You go through thesecond cycle. All right? Come back purified, rested and then it works out.” So not necessarily that everybody will be cured, not necessarily. But so many have got cured and it has worked. But that’s not our main job is to give cures to people. No. It is to give Realization to people and as a by-product as you said, of course if she gets Realization her deafness will go away. Many people have cured their deafness. Not only deafness but even bald headed people have got hair. He had no hair on his head when he came to Me. But I don’t say that after Realization, and before Realization it’s so tremendous that it’s better to take photographs before Realization and see yourself. Sometimes after Realization people, see, they have got their photographs before Realization, they have thrown them away. It is different but the main thing is not curing, it’s the Self Realization – that’s the main thing. And, age has no problem. Yesterday I think in Birmingham we gave Realization to somebody who was a very, very old man. So age has no consideration, health has no consideration, nothing of the kind. Everyone can get it and should try to get it. All right?”</p><p>Video Reference (4:45):</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzUQzb2Kjfs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzUQzb2Kjfs</a></p><p>……<br /> “When Kundalini rises a some sort of a muscular contraction takes place which keeps the risen Kundalini upward and then it dilates, it opens out and then it contracts. All these things take place automatically within ourselves. As we start the car, every machinery starts working. In the same way the Kriya takes place actually within ourselves. So the Kriya takes place within us in Sahaja Yoga. All are subsidiary to Sahaja Yoga, means the Yoga itself. But all these things take place inside ourselves. But on the contrary we can do one thing: without starting the car we can start moving the wheel. That is Kriya Yoga, so-called. So that is at juxtaposition with the real Kriya Yoga which is spontaneous, built-in within us. You don’t have to do anything, you are meant for it. I have seen people. Their tongues are cut. They are wagging their tongues. Very old people in India have got this from somebody from America. Horrible fellow. They cut their tongues and their tongues are wagging like this. They are useless people. One doctor was like that, one doctor. A seeker, imagine a seeker being ruined like that. I said, “Why? Why did you do that?” He said, “We are supposed to do khechari.” Khechari is a thing where you cut the tongue, put it back and try to touch this back side with the tongue tip. Can you imagine? As it call as dawedi raveni pranayams – these are of no use. These things have ruined the path of Kundalini. I have seen the Kundalini being hurt, wounded. She just tosses Her head all sides. This is the ego of man, he thinks, “I can do it and I’ll go to any extent to do it.” Forget it. It’s so simple. Just like an enlightened light, enlightened candle can enlighten another candle. It works out that simple ways. Don’t do all these things to yourself. If you are a real seeker, just forget it. Don’t ruin yourself. There’s nothing you did to ruin yourself. This is done because they are earnest seekers. Their ego is pampered that you can do it, they do it. In Sahaja Yoga, you don’t have to do anything till you are Realized. Like the people who don’t know how to swim are told, You keep silent. We’ll try to bring you to the shore.” So they are brought to the shore, they are taught how to swim, how to save people and then they save thepeople. You don’t have to do anything till you get your real Realization and the mastery over it. Unless and until you become the master you are not to do anything. You have to become the master first. It takes hardly any time to become the master. It’s too good to believe, but it is true. Everything that is perfect looks like that. Isn’t it?”</p><p>Video Reference (3:22):</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P30ZbjU66k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P30ZbjU66k</a></p><p>1982-­0711: <font color="red">Public Program, Day 2, From Heart to Sahasrara, Derby, UK</font></p><p>“As I told you yesterday, sitting down here, if you want to feel about anyone you can find out. Like just now I saw one gentlemen sitting a little awkwardly, I thought, he is not sitting properly, I said, “Sit properly.” But then I paid attention to him, I knew he is not well so I said, “Have you got any problem?” “Yes.” I said, “Then it is all right.” So with attention you immediately understand a person, what’s the problem with that person is. Sitting down here you can find out the vibrations of anyone. For example now we can say… if there is no Russian … that …, should I say or not, … Brezhnev is possessed, he is a possessed man, just like (that?). I’m going to Russia, I hope I’ll take out his possessions. He’s a possessed man. They are dealing in these parapsychology. Same in America it’s going to happen, it is going to happen everywhere where you try to practice these spirit, spiritualist and all that what you call preta vidya, smashana vidya and all that which is absolutely horrible things, calling them with sophisticated names like parapsychology and call it by - what other names do they call it? Charismatic movements and all sorts of … it’s nothing but spirits, nothing but spirits. All these people are practicing nothing but spirits. They bring out the dead spirits and call it the Holy Ghost, imagine? This charismatic movement is another horrible thing, I don’t know how to tell you about it, but I must say that the whole science has become so subtle that nobody knows that this is thescorpious, horrible, satanic force that is working through us and attracting us to these spirits. Some people said, “Mother there are good spirits and bad spirits.” But why, why, why go to the dead? You don’t know which is good and which is bad. How will you know? Why go to the dead? We have to be in the present, we don’t have to be in the past. So that’s one thing happens when you lose your valences that you go to the left. When you go to the right, you may be very austere, you don’t eat that food, that food, and this and that, you may become a very ego-oriented person. You go to another side, called supra-conscious, the collective supra-conscious. The left side is the collective subconscious and the right side is the collective supra-conscious. When I started My work I decided not to talk about these dead spirits. I said, “I’ll manage without that.” Was not possible. For three years I never talked about it. I didn’t talk about the deities, I didn’t talk about anything. For three years I managed it, but then among us a lady came who was practicing all these things, and she possessed so many people. And thousands of people used to go to her. She would tell them which horse will come first, where is the money lost. All sorts ofthings, and thousands of people used to throng, you know. Here we have so few people but let some tantrika come in, you won’t be able to control your traffic. This will be the condition, with any one of these horrible people coming in. And this lady really made Me talk of these things and that’s what it is. They exist. So going to the left or to the right, you go into a problem, because you enter into an unknown area which is very dangerous, very dangerous.”</p><p>Video Reference (4:20):</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQARN0ZWGL0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQARN0ZWGL0</a></p><p>……<br /> “For example eastern people suffer from too much talking - right side Vishuddhi we call it - and the western suffer from not talking at all, specially English, they never talk. Actually you have to pinch them, and they never laugh, that’s the problem with them, just smile and it’s regarded good manners but it is sometimes very boring. Now the Left Vishuddhi is a thing which is much very much more subtler than what we think of, is a very funny sort of a situation where you get a Left Vishuddhi and that you get very commonly among the western people, because they have developed a new sense of guilt. I mean everybody is guilty. Without going to the courts, without committing any guilt, everybody is guilty all the time. Like a lady, “Oh, I’m so guilty.” “What happened?” “I didn’t say ‘thank you’ to her.” So it doesn’t matter. What is there to be guilty after all? “Oh I’m so guilty.” “What happened?” I spilt some coffee.” So all right, doesn’t matter, it can be cleared out, what is there to be guilty? But it is an unknown guilt people have, they don’t know why they are guilty, why they are getting all the time this feeling. “Oh God, I should not have done it, I should not have done that.” What? What guilt we can have, and this guilt is a horrifying thing. I have seen start from America, England, Portugal, Spain, Italy, all that, Switzerland, all these places nothing but Left Vishuddhi is the first problem and the last which I have to conquer. One lady got up and she said, “Mother I am guilty because of Vietnam.” I said, “Vietnam? It is finished long time back now, what are you going to do about it?” “No, but I’m guilty about it.” “But why? What are you going to do about it, how are you concerned with it, what is your relationship with it, why are you guilty?” “I just feel guilty.” I said, “It’s nonsense.” Like that everybody has developed this, now from where does it come. Let’s see the source, the first source comes from Bible, which is very wrongly interpreted, saying that, “You are a sinner, a born sinner.” I mean absurd! What it means is that, that you are the one who is only aware of the sins, not the animals. You are the one who is aware of your ignorance, not the animals, you are the one who is aware of your blindness, others are not, animals are not. Why? Because within you is developed that I-ness. That I-ness as I told you yesterday is developed because of the ego and the super ego meeting here, because you raised your head, because this chakra was to be enlightened. You raised your head and this ego and super ego went and met here, it calcified, you got your I-ness and that’s why you think, “I’ve done wrong or I’ve done right.” Animals don’t think like that, they are not bothered, they have to do what they do, they want to do it, they never sit down and say, “I am guilty.” Have you ever met any animal who says that? Except for the human beings, all the time. Now this has come to, it’s a myth, it is a very big big myth with which you are living, is absolutely, believe Me. There is nothing like guilt and this guilt is eating you off all the time, it is making you an inertia, it is making you feel so much lost. And this center is very important to be opened out. So first of all before I start any program I tell them, one mantra should say, “Mother I am not guilty, Mother I am not guilty,” sixteen times, that’s the punishment for being guilty. If you are guilty you must go into punishment, all right? So this is the punishment for you, is to say, “Mother I am not guilty, Mother I am not guilty.” Say it sixteen times, and that’s how you get rid of it. It’s so practical, it works out. With that you get spondylitis, you get pain in the heart, you get this hand what you call frigid hand, all problems you get with that, and that is all because ofthis mythical guilt you are working out.”</p><p>Video Reference (5:11):</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnS1va0HL4k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnS1va0HL4k</a></p><p>……<br /> “There was a girl in India, which is very abnormal, she came to Me and she said that she wants to be with girls and she wants to marry a girl, she wants to dress up like a man. I said to her, “Really?” So I gave her some Sahaja Yoga treatment and I found that there was a man in her. She was reduced to nothing, this was a man who was possessing her, and she was given these ideas through that man, and that’s was how she was talking, she was a possessed person. All these abnormalities come because you get possessed. There was a girl in Cuba, came to see Me. From Cuba, in America, a short girl, very petite, small, good looking girl and she told Me, her husband told Me, “Mother, surprising, my wife can take whiskey bottle neat like that, one she drink it down.” So I said: “All right, sit down.” I give her a bandhan as we call it, and I saw a big, huge like a Globe Trotter, really a very huge negro coming out of her, and I looked at her. I said, “Do you know any negro?” She said, “Mother, do you see him? Do you see him? He is the one who drinks, I do not drink,” she said to Me, and when he was distracted from, she became such a sweet wife to her husband. All these abnormal behaviors when you overdo it, lead us to that collective subconscious, where you catch all these horrible people, also it can lead you to collective supra conscious if you become very, very egoistical. Then you can become Hitler. “What’s wrong? What’s wrong? What’s wrong with Hitler?” Nothing wrong, he was perfectly correct when he said that he has come to save all the Aryan race and his nose was a specially made one. I mean God must have been surprised to hear all that, I mean you have to create some variety, isn’t it? But this is what it is, I mean these absurd things that we do in our life as saying, “What’s wrong?” We jump into those ditches where you cannot return without some load on your head, and those loads work out all the things, and you become such abnormal people. Then on the street you’ll stand and shout like a madman, and if you provoke them they are even worse, so better not talk with them and argue with them. Forget them. All those fanatics that we see are nothing but possessed people. Most of them are possessed. I would say so many of presidents and these despotic people, most of them are possessed. I meet them, I shake hands with them, they shake before Me and I know that they are possessed people, how are they there? They should not be there, they are possessed, they possess other people, they make them work out and all this aggressiveness starts through their possessing powers.”</p><p>Video Reference (3:12):</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frqRPoLq9Nw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frqRPoLq9Nw</a></p></section><footer class="page__meta"></footer></div></article></div><script src="https://seven-teams.github.io/assets/js/main.min.js"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', '', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script src="https://unpkg.com/vanilla-back-to-top@7.2.1/dist/vanilla-back-to-top.min.js"></script> <script>addBackToTop()</script></body></html>
