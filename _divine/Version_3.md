<p>
<font color="DarkGreen">I. Primarily aimed at:</font><br>
Sahaja Yogis, Sahaja Yoginīs and Seekers of Truth. 
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkGreen">II. Numerical Data on</font>
<font color="blue"> Divine Message, Version 3:</font> <br>
1. has 16,041 pages (an increment of 4,309 pages from Version 2);<br>
2. contains 4,156 transcripts started (an increment of 1,099 from Version 2);<br>
3. contains 124 figures (an increment of 22 figures from Version 2 which apparently overreported due to a typo 108 instead of 102 figures);<br>
4. has a size of 190.4 mb.<br>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkGreen">III. Key features.</font><br>
01. Single English used throughout except for original hand writings.<br>
02. Full usage of International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration (IAST).<br>
03. Full access to the whole database without any dependency on internet access (of course, once the file is downloaded).<br>
04. Unlimited possibilities through lists (such as contents, categories, etc.): currently 5 main lists are used (Contents -- Lists -- Pūjā Types -- Countries -- Five countries).<br> 
05. Full navigation at the bottom of each page supplemented with a direct link to the whole list of the same category of the transcript at the end of each transcript.<br>
06. Three protocols observed towards <font color="red"><b>Śhrī Mātājī</b></font>: <font color="SaddleBrown"><b>Family Members</b></font>, <font color="Chocolate"><b>Seekers</b></font>, and <b>Sahaja Yogis</b>/<b>Sahaja Yoginīs</b>. [This feature is not completed but is already extensively implemented.]<br>
07. Three languages=three colors: English, <font color="DarkViolet">Hindi</font>, <font color="DarkOrange">Marathi</font>. These colors are tentative (subject to your kind input). So far, this feature is implemented fully only for 1 transcript as a sample (<font color="blue"><b>1979-0330 Public Program (Hindi), Dhyāna meṃ Śhraddhā kā Mahatva (Importance of Faith in Meditation), the day before the Departure to London, Pune, Maharashtra, India</b></font>) and exceptionally in few other places.<br>
08. Unabridged from all points of view.<br>
09. A double system of quotation marks for better grasping.<br>
10. Full itemization for the sake of localization, identification, references, etc.<br>
11. A careful capitalization of certain (groups of) words that are expressing Divine Poetry (such as Altar of Truth) or are often at the core of the Divine Message (such as Second Birth) or help the reading (such as "he ran after Him").<br>
12. A system of footnotes, subsections, etc. supports the comprehension and the presentation.<br>
13. A system of interconnections/references between transcripts.<br>
14. A system of <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Sources:</b></font>, [<font color="DarkOrange"><b>unclear</b></font>], [<font color="DarkOrange"><b>gap</b></font>], [<font color="DarkOrange"><b>missing</b></font>], [<font color="DeepPink"><b>SYNOPSIS!</b></font>], and ...... facilitates the references, warning, understanding and the reading.<br>
15. A uniform and comparative study of all transcripts.<br>
16. An extensive data collection for a high accuracy of dates and places (partially reflected in the Version 3 as well).<br>

<p>
<font color="DarkGreen">V. Your support.</font><br>
Your kind support for the other three teams (Quotes on Incarnations Team, Scriptures Team, Chronology Team), so that they become fully involved again, would be very much appreciated. 
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkGreen">VI. Current work flow.</font><br>
1. Intensive work on about 1,000 events with transcripts started.<br>
2. Gradual work on the other 3,156 events with transcripts started.<br>
3. Queued work on additional 7,513 events among which hundreds and hundreds will become events with transcripts.<br>
In the last 4 years, the <font color="mediumvioletred">Database of Transcripts/Quotes</font> grew up by 3.5 pages a day (as an average), and it is very much expected that this intensive growth will continue for at least 7 more years. Gradually, the file will grow to a number of pages between <font color="mediumvioletred">25,000 (an increment of 4,000 from Version 2) and 108,000.</font>
