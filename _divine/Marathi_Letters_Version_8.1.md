Dear Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginīs,<br>
<br>
We have been notified by the Photo Subteam that May 10 and May 11, 2023, were the first days so far when the Eternal Moments got more than 100K views in a day (1 Photo/photo viewed counts as 1 view), and this was mainly due to dozens of thousands of views of the Handwritings galleries. As such, we felt extremely inspired and highly motivated to share with you all a slim pdf file of just 28 mb with all the 31 Marathi Letters that are currently in our database and that, of course, will be part of the <font color="blue">Divine Message, Version 8.1</font> which will be shared next Sunday (most of them were also part of the earlier versions of <font color="blue">Divine Message</font>). The pdf file is available at the link
<a href="https://bit.ly/Marathi_Letters_Divine_Message_V8_1"><font color="blue">Marathi Letters, from Version 8.1</font></a>.<br>
<br>
We will keep sharing such files whenver new letters or new translations are added to it.<br>
<br>
Please kindly share the link with all our brothers and sisters.<br>
<br>
Jay Śhrī Mātājī!<br>
