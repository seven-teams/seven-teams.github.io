<br>

<p>
Shri Mother You Are My Shepard<br>
I shall want ...<br>
You are so solicitous of my wellbeing.<br>
You quieten my thoughts until they are like still waters.<br>
You have come to restore my soul.<br>
It is You who shows me the path of righteousness<br>
That I must travel, for Your name's sake.<br>
<br>
I know that even thought I walk through<br>
The valley of the shadow of death,
I should fear no evil:<br>
For You are with me.<br>
Your vibrations and my Kundalini<br>
Are there to comfort me.<br>
<br>
You make it know to my enemies<br>
That I am one of your children.<br>
You annoint my head with the Grace of God,<br>
And Chaitanya flows upon me.<br>
Surely goodness and mercy<br>
Shall follow me all the days of my life,<br>
And I shall dwell in the glow<br>
Of Your Heart forever.<br>
</p>
