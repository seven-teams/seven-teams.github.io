<p>
Little Johnny Bottlebee<br>
Was rosy, round, and full of glee.<br>
So full of merry glee was he<br>
That all the day he sang "tee-hee,<br>
"Tee-hee, tee-hee" he sang carefree,<br>
And no one ever disagreed.<br>
<br>
Now, one fine day<br>
As he was out,<br>
Out and about<br>
To sing and play,<br>
He took a shortcut<br>
Through the woods,<br>
The honey woods<br>
Where bears abound.<br>
And as he danced<br>
Along the trail<br>
He heard a sound,<br>
A long, sad wail,<br>
So Johnny stopped<br>
And cocked his head<br>
To see if he<br>
Could spot the spot<br>
Where that sad cry<br>
Was crying from.<br>
As he stepped<br>
Toward the sound.<br>
A furry face,<br>
All wet and round,<br>
Came poking through<br>
The bushy bush<br>
And almost pushed<br>
Round Johnny down!<br>
"Why do you cry?"<br>
Asked Johnny to<br>
That soft, brown bear<br>
Who cried "boo-hoo".<br>
"I have no one<br>
To hug", he hooed<br>
And then he booed<br>
And hooed again,<br>
And down his tears<br>
Did rain and rain.<br>
<br>
Now, Johnny knew<br>
That no one plays<br>
With wild bears<br>
Not night or day<br>
But here he was<br>
Now face to face,<br>
In such a bushy,<br>
Woodsy place,<br>
With a bear<br>
Who seemed to need<br>
A playful hug<br>
To cheer him up.<br>
'How to hug<br>
' A baby bear?'<br>
Thought Johnny<br>
Stepping just<br>
A little nearer.<br>
But very much<br>
To his surprise<br>
That bearly jumped<br>
And in a wink,<br>
Without a second<br>
More to think,<br>
Jolly Johnny<br>
And that bear<br>
Were rolling,<br>
Cuddling, giggling there<br>
Without a thought<br>
Or tear or care.<br>
And after hugging,<br>
Up jumped bear<br>
And smiling, ran<br>
Away from there.<br>
<br>
Johnny sat up<br>
And laughed "tee-hee"<br>
"Now I see<br>
"How it should be<br>
"If it's not safe<br>
"To hug a bear<br>
"I won't hug bears<br>
"- Let bears hug me!"<br>
