<br>

<p>
Damodara is He who is known through discipline<br>
Known through the mind which is purified<br>
By means of self-control<br>
And other qualities<br>
<br>
Dama is control of the senses<br>
Or because He, in His Krishna form<br>
Was tied up by Yeshoda<br>
By a cord around his waist between two trees.<br>
<br>
Waist is udara, hence Damodara<br>
Sage Vyasa says,<br>
Dama means the worlds<br>
And, as they are in Him,<br>
The Lord is named Damodara.<br>
