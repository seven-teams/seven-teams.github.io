<p>
There once was a child<br>
Who played with a ball<br>
And thought of the children<br>
With no ball at all:<br>
<br>
He picked up that ball<br>
And gave it a kiss<br>
And for every poor child<br>
A ball he did wish.<br>
<br>
There once was a child<br>
Who looked at the sky<br>
And seeing the dirt there<br>
She started to cry:<br>
<br>
She reached out her arms<br>
Hugged sky to her heart<br>
And prayed that the people<br>
Stop sending up dark.<br>
<br>
There once was a child<br>
Who dreamt in the night<br>
That God is inside us<br>
With comfort and light,<br>
<br>
And when the time comes<br>
For the Mother to rise<br>
All the problems will end<br>
In the love from our eyes.<br>
</p>
