<p>
A woman is seated beside a cradle,<br>
Therein a baby lies,<br>
Softly she sings a lullaby,<br>
To soothe it's anguished cries.<br>
<br>
A lioness licks her baby cub,<br>
And purrs in loving tones,<br>
It's her job to give it love,<br>
And listen to it's moans.<br>
<br>
An eagle swoops down and snatches a mouse,<br>
And glides to the perch of her young,<br>
She has spent the day in scorching heat,<br>
To feed her only son.<br>
<br>
But what more could a mother wish for,<br>
What more would a lioness want,<br>
Would an eagle wish for anyone else,<br>
To return to after a long day's hunt.<br>
</p>
