<p style="text-align:center;">
She can say what she thinks<br>
She can do what she wants<br>
<br>
She can laugh when she feels like laughing<br>
She can joke when she feels like joking<br>
<br>
Her brother is there to listen<br>
Her brother is there to understand<br>
<br>
She can be serious when required<br>
She doesn’t need to be afraid<br>
<br>
She is loved no matter what<br>
She is looked after when in need<br>
<br>
He can tease her if he wants<br>
As long as it’s not mean<br>
<br>
He can protect her if he sees a need<br>
He can be told off by her if he needs to be<br>
<br>
He can advise her if he feels<br>
He can embarrass himself It’s ok!<br>
<br>
The Mother is there to look after both of them
<br>
