Our school's senior section is divided into three groups of houses respectively Satyam, Shivam, Sundaram House. In September we had a "Just a Minute" competition which was held house-wise. It started like this: all the houses sat in their respective places and participants' names were given. Each person had to go and there was a lottery system by which they picked the topic that they had to talk on. A few topics were "If I were a Carpenter:, "If I were a World Leader" etc. Most of the children were very nervous. This was an exercise to get rid of stage-fear and encourage public speaking. Rishi Nicolai stood first with his topic "How do I go into Thoughtless Awareness and What Do I Feel". Everyone enjoyed it a lot.
