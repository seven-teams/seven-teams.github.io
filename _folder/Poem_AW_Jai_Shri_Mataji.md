<p>
"Houl' yer wisht" my granny said<br>
When Iasked her where me mammy was<br>
Or sometimes "She's run off with a sailor"<br>
A toddler's mind never knew what that meant.<br>
<br>
Once a girl in our street said,<br>
"Alan Wherry, you've got sleekit eyes like a Fenian."<br>
I wondered if she knew the derivation of sleekit.<br>
Or what a Fenian was?<br>
<br>
There was grace in them and in what they said And how they were, elemental fused with love<br>
In a stocking granny drowned newborn kittens<br>
Her aul' tabby looking on from the top of the back yard wall.<br>
<br>
Whoever would have thought I'd get Self-realized<br>
All part of the divine being.<br>
My aunt Annie knew and said of me<br>
"He was one of us, but different, he was in his own way."<br>
<br>
Sahai love at Krasni Ploshchad<br>
Synecdoche on a sunny September day<br>
Ananya, permanence, devotion to a wife to be<br>
Spiritually more evolved than me.<br>
