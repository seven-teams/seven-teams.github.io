<p>
Black, brown, red, white and yellow<br>
One race, the human race<br>
Four fingers, one thumb, one hand<br>
No separation, one nation, one race<br>
<br>
The drop becomes the ocean<br>
By dissolving its dropness<br>
Into the other drops<br>
<br>
For a moment, in a splash<br>
It feels itself separate, individual<br>
Then it falls back into the oneness<br>
<br>
Devotion is double-wedged<br>
One to each other, one to the mother<br>
She sees what we can't see<br>
She sees beyond us<br>
And whatever She sees happens<br>
<br>
Whosoever plays tricks with Her<br>
Plays tricks with themselves<br>
Surrender than, as the drop loses its dropness<br>
And becomes the ocean.<br>
</p>
