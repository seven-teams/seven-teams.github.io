<p>
The shennai calls our hearts and minds<br>
to stillness and repose.<br>
We sit in colourful array<br>
in long and segregated rows.<br>
Beneath a canopy of cloth<br>
to shield us from the noonday sun.<br>
We wait and watch, expectantly.<br>
Each in a world his own .....<br>
the eastern shadow marches on,<br>
as time ticks slowly by.<br>
The stillness flawed by cawing crows,<br>
braying their b[h]ajans to the sky.<br>
This is a timelessness, so dear<br>
to both the spirit and the soul ....<br>
the wondrous balm of Nirmala<br>
descends and makes us whole.<br>
And then when we at last have reached<br>
that place of deep and lasting peace,<br>
She comes - our mother of the universe.<br>
We rise with open hearts - our thoughts have ceased!<br>
There is a special magic to the scene,<br>
an expectation of we know not what.<br>
It is the essence of this holy land -<br>
exposed by puja in Bharat. 
Sometimes we hear her words,<br>
Like temple bells within our head.<br>
Sometimes we're startled and amazed<br>
that all is done and time, our enemy, has fled.<br>
Sometimes - those special times -<br>
we feel our hearts and minds expand.<br>
As if our Mother Nirmala has called<br>
us forth to take us by the hand.<br>
There are no words the human tongue<br>
can hopefully explain<br>
those heart fulfilling moments<br>
when we sing her love's refrain.<br>
Oh Nirmala - Shri Nirmala,<br>
a boon I pray, t'is that ....<br>
I never lose the memory of puja in Bharat.<br>
<br>
Beginning to understand the Power and Benevolence<br>
Of the blessings of the Adi Shakti;<br>
Our Will is inspired,<br>
Our hearts raised up<br>
And the Dharma of Sahaja is duely done.<br>
