<p>
I often hear a voice in my head,<br>
Which tells me what is wrong,<br>
And what is right.<br>
But there is yet another voice in my head,<br>
Which tells me to "just go ahead!"<br>
<br>
Now the problem with the people in this world,<br>
Is that they seem to fall for "just go ahead".<br>
They seem to push the good voice aside,<br>
That tells us what is right<br>
And of course what is wrong.<br>
<br>
Why? Because the bad voice inside,<br>
Tempts them with things,<br>
That they believe they would enjoy<br>
But in the end it leads them to their downfall.<br>
<br>
So please don't get lured,<br>
Be careful and be aware,<br>
Because that voice is always there!
</p>
