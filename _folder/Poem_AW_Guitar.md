<p>
Guitar I posed with my new guitar,<br>
a birthday present from my Dad<br>
Made in the shipyard joiner's shop<br>
The neck, balustrade and buttress<br>
Unplayable above the fourth fret<br>
<br>
Fretted where he thought they looked nice<br>
Love oozed from its every grain and pore<br>
Only cowboy chords played nicely<br>
The limits of my skill.<br>
<br>
Me and Bertie Richie<br>
Were photographed with an LP of Elvis<br>
Me with my guitar<br>
He with my Dad's banjo ukulele,<br>
Handier for George Formby<br>
Than Link Wray or Scottie Moore.<br>
<br>
We had more than one thing in common<br>
No sense of what was possible<br>
Had we kept at it.<br>
<br>
Teenage dreams are fervent, zealous<br>
They overpower the reality of hard work and practice.<br>
</p>
