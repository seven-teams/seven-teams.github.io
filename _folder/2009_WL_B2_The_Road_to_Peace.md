<p style="text-align:center;">
A step in evolution<br>
nearly always starts with chaos<br>
Evolution is a force not easily contained<br>
<br>
Peace is the desired stage<br>
to which the force should lead<br>
In between, though, there is a lot of sorting out<br>
<br>
Challenges, temptations, mistakes,<br>
and the ability to change<br>
all work together towards a higher state<br>
<br>
Love, compassion, knowledge, understanding<br>
are some of the helpers towards a state of peace<br>
<br>
Hate, aggression, frustration, desperation<br>
are some of the helpers for the sorting out<br>
<br>
Evolution does not only happen over generations<br>
Evolution happens inside of me and you<br>
<br>
May the force of evolution guide us as<br>
the world is moving<br>
towards a stage of newfound peace
</p>
