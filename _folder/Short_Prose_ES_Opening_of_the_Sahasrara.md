<p style="text-align:center;">
(We all know that the Sahasrara of the Virat was opened on 5th of May<br>
1970 at a place called Nargol, in India. We all understand what<br>
a significant event it was. But, what actually happened? Let us re-live<br>
the experience as described by our Holy Mother in Her own words.)<br>
