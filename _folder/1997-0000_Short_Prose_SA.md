<p>
It is a holiday and a celebration. On this day at night, we burn the effigy of Ravana, the king of Lanka. Earlier, he was a good saint but when his ego came over, he became bad. At the end, he was killed by Lord Rama. When he was about to die, he learnt his lesson that one must never let ego rule over one's self. We burnt him before dinner.
