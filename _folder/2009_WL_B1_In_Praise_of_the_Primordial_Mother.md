<p style="text-align:center;">
There exists<br>
a power in the universe<br>
Beyond space, beyond time<br>
<br>
It is<br>
a movement<br>
created by love, compassion and evolution<br>
The cause of time, cause of creation<br>
Cause of life and knowledge<br>
<br>
She is a power in you – a power in me<br>
A power you can feel – a power in motion<br>
A power you can give – a power you can receive<br>
<br>
She is so close to me<br>
Gently moving me to keep evolving<br>
<br>
She is so kind to me<br>
Gently making me forgive myself and others<br>
<br>
She is so dear to me<br>
Gently touching me to give comfort to my heart<br>
<br>
The Mother is a power without the need to rule<br>
The Mother is a power with a purpose to develop<br>
The Mother is a power free to share with all<br>
