Once upon a time there lived a very cunning rac[c]oon, he always used to joke around with creatures smaller than himself. He used to trample on ants and he also annoyed animals bigger than him, he used to scare the lion by doing plaits in his mane while he was sleeping and annoy the baboon by taking his best T-shirt and rubbing it in the mud.<br>
One day he was again abboying the baboon when he heard the lion roar. He saw the lion charging at him, so he climbed up a nearby tree. The tree said, "You have been annoying our animals for too long." The rac[c]oon said, "If I answer any of the questions you ask me, will you let me go?" The lion agreed. So he asked him "What kind of baths do Ghosts have?" The rac[c]oon replied "A Booble Bath". The lion was astonished at his clever answer He said, "Fine you have to answer just one more question. What do Italian Ghosts eat?" "They eat Spookhetti" was his clever reply. Again the lion was surprised. So he said, "I will let you go".<br>
After a few weeks, the lion and the rac[c]oon became best friends. So whenever the cunning jackals argued, the rac[c]oon came to his rescue with a more clever answer. The rac[c]oon never annoyed anyone anymore and gave lots of love and care to everyone. Now everyone was his friend.
