<p>
“He was one of us but different, he was in his own way,”<br>
Is what his family said of him.<br>
<br>
He met Lioudmila in Moscow, she was like him, different too.<br>
Her first thought when she saw him was, “This is my husband.”<br>
It took him longer to reach the same conclusion, that here was the love of his life<br>
- all of five minutes.<br>
<br>
He'd never known this feeling that enveloped him, but a feeling he recognized instantly.<br>
<br>
They walked in Red Square's September sunshine and barely spoke.<br>
She was shy, knew little English but words would have been superfluous, an excess, an intrusion on the depths of their communication.<br>
<br> 
He experienced satisfaction, completion,<br>
Parts of the puzzle that were him, that had made no sense before, now fell into place,<br>
and parts that he never knew were missing, were now present, upfront, out of nowhere.<br>
It had all been arranged, of course,<br>
<br> 
She had traveled seventeen hours by train and on the train had been told that he'd already been matched with someone else.<br>
She was unconcerned, surrendered, such was her trust in the living Goddess who'd made the arrangement and who had told her previously that She'd find her a husband but that he wasn't ready yet.<br>
<br>
And the Goddess had told him that She would find him a wife, a Russian wife.<br>
He'd waited, year by year, and knew that when the time came,<br>
He would never say no to Her choice, and he didn't.<br>
<br>
Both felt the cool breeze of paramchaitanya cascading all around them.<br>
<br>
For her part, she'd vaguely thought, in vacant mood,<br>
That she didn't particularly want to marry an Englishman,<br>
For the ones she'd met smelled of mothballs.<br>
And difference between English and Irish, was as alien to her<br>
As his understanding of the difference between Russian, Uzbek and Tatar.<br>
<br> 
Joy, satisfaction, bliss, mutual ascent - were the blessings that came their way.<br>
Who could want more? Not them, not ever.<br>
