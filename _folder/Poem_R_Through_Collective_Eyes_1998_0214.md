<p>
Candles on a wooden table glowing splendidly,<br>
casting beautiful shadows in semi-darkness,<br>
quivering slightly with the power of vibrations.<br>
<br>
A lamp glows, steadily with confidence<br>
Sweet smells of incense fills the air<br>
"Her Grace" is present, encast in brass and glass<br>
Crimson kumkum catches collective attention.<br>
<br>
Clutching my heart. bringing sheer pleasure and<br>
love at first sight of Her Holiness.<br>
Choking, trying to subdue our tears of joy,<br>
Devotees bow to Her Holiness's Divine Lotus<br>
Feet, confident of being blessed.<br>
<br>
Devotees settle down, knowing soon they will be<br>
enchanted by great power and joy.<br>
What greatness to feel Shri Adi Shakti soar<br>
through — taking you to Thoughtless Awareness —<br>
now you are in union with the Divine.<br>
<br>
Chilling coolness ripples through you —<br>
You know you are not alone —<br>
Her Holiness is now present.<br>
</p>
