<p style="text-align:center;">
Am I these thoughts?<br>
Am I the expanding space<br>
in between these searching thoughts?<br>
Am I this face, am I this heart, am I this longing?<br>
<br>
Am I the silence of deep emotion?<br>
Am I the silence beyond the flow of inspiration?<br>
Am I the silence penetrating every pore<br>
as I become aware of you?<br>
<br>
Am I eternity captured in a single moment?<br>
Am I awareness of the realm beyond a time or space?<br>
Am I joy of unison, Father, Child and Mother<br>
reflecting in my soul?<br>
<br>
I am I no more<br>
I am myself
</p>
