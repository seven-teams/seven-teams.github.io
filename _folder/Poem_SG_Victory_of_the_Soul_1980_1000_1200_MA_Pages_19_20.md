<p>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Let us sing, let us sing ever the glory of the Mother;<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Let us dance, let us dance ever with the bliss of the Divine.<br>
<br>
The glory of the soul is ages old,<br>
With the setting of mankind in the soil of mother Earth,<br>
And the coming of incarnations ever revealed the path,<br>
All often for the victory of the soul.<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Let us sing, let us sing ever the glory of the Mother;<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Let us dance, Let us dance ever with the bliss of the Divine.<br>
<br>
The Universe is a poetry of the Divine in nature,<br>
In a nutshell representation of a human with virtues;<br>
Marvelous enough to know marvelous combinations,<br>
All often for the victory of the soul.<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Let us sing, let us sing ever the glory of Mother;<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Let us dance, let us dance ever with the bliss of the Divine.<br>
<br>
The chapter in the poetry, telling ever the reality,<br>
Are the coming of incarnations to guide the humanity;<br>
When fallen in sick and sullen in goal,<br>
All often for the victory of the soul.<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Let us sing, let us sing ever the glory of Mother;<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Let us dance, let us dance ever with the bliss of the Divine.<br>
<br>
The concluding chapter to conclude near is Sahaja Yoga,<br>
Surprise thee not! certain to happen in this Yuga;<br>
With the advent of the Mother we attain the goal,<br>
All often for the victory of the soul.<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Let us sing, let us sing ever the glory of Mother;<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Let us dance, let us dance ever with the bliss of the Divine.<br>
<br>
Fear thee not, the Mother is here,<br>
Worry thee not, the Divine is here;<br>
Perfect in our pursuit, sincere in our devotion,<br>
All often for the victory of the soul.<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Let us sing, let us sing ever the glory of Mother;<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Let us dance, let us dance ever with the bliss of the Divine.<br>
<br>
Sinking of a ship with sailors of offenders<br>
Yet to come a long long distance;<br>
Look thee not, look thee not; for us the Divine,<br>
All often for the victory of the soul.<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Let us sing, let us sing ever the glory of Mother;<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Let us dance, Let us dance ever with the bliss of the Divine.<br>
<br>
Forget thee not the purpose of life,<br>
With the pursuit of truth in the kingdom of God;<br>
Foretold by the sages of the ages and saints of the legends<br>
All often for the victory of the soul.<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Let us sing, let us sing ever the glory of Mother;<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Let us dance, let us dance ever with the bliss of the Divine.<br>
<br>
The victory of the soul is with thy hands,<br>
The nectar of the Divine is wetted in the vein;<br>
With the advent of the Mother we achieve the goal,<br>
All often for the victory of the soul.<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Let us sing, let us sing ever the glory of Mother;<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Let us dance, let us dance ever with the bliss of the Divine.<br>
