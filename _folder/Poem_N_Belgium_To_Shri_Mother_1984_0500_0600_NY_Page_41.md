<p>
I am a humble little flower<br>
&emsp;&emsp; blooming in your Garden of Divinity<br>
Your Holy grace and unending Love<br>
&emsp;&emsp; makes me grow stronger and stronger,<br>
Until I have become a great honorable tree,<br>
&emsp;&emsp; who manages to reach with my<br>
&emsp;&emsp; powerful branches, at last...Eternity!<br>
</p>
