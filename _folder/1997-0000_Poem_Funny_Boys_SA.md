<p>
Once he was very gay,<br>
So his mummy told him to go and play,<br>
Then he looked up at the sun,<br>
And tried to have fun,<br>
"Ho ! sunny sunny toy,<br>
How are you going boy!''<br>
"You are very naughty", said the Sun,<br>
"I was just having fun!"<br>
So he bent, and home he went<br>
He had his supper,<br>
with his mother. Then he went to sleep, does it seem<br>
Of course with a dream. 
</p>
