<p>
Native of my mind is the motive of my life.<br>
Oh, my Divine Mother;<br>
Identification of 'my-self' is the purification of my soul;<br>
Oh, my al Pervading Mother;<br>
Realization of my soul is the authorization of my path;<br>
Oh, my Blissful Mother;<br>
Making of my perfectness is the shaking of my devils,<br>
Oh, my Protecting Mother;<br>
Avtar of God is the maker of divinity,<br>
Oh, my Primordial Mother;<br>
Least of the desires is the most of the sermons,<br>
Oh, my Breezeful Mother;<br>
Amenity of the nature is the enmity of the vulture,<br>
Oh, my Everloving Mother;<br>
Diviner of the soul is finer than the nature,<br>
Oh, my Everliving Mother;<br>
Amicable of the world is the placeable of the universe,<br>
Oh, my Universal Mother;<br>
Victor of the soul is the nectar of the Divine,<br>
Oh, my Graceful Mother;<br>
Ideal of the life is the needle of the compass,<br>
Oh, my Immaculate Mother;<br>
Victory to thee AUM, AUM, AUM.<br>
</p>
