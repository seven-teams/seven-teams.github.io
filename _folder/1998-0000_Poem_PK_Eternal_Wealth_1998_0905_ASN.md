<p>
The question of material wealth<br>
a spectred myth that haunts by stealth<br>
the minds, desires of mortal man<br>
consumes the heart and thwarts the Plan<br>
<br>
For what is Man, his destination?<br>
and what The Plan, what explanation?<br>
and what our Seeking, what our Need?<br>
and why this vast material greed?<br>
<br>
These gross desires for more and more<br>
are but a shadow I am sure<br>
of that deepest Primordial Fire<br>
that raised us all with pure desire<br>
<br>
For we are not just low and base<br>
our Source is from a higher place<br>
and as we grow, evolve together<br>
our Worth is not our fiscal measure<br>
<br>
Our needs are truly very small<br>
yet wants go on, o'ershadow all<br>
and yet our greatest need is not<br>
Fulfilled by all these things we've got<br>
<br>
Aversions are the things that scar<br>
attachments are the things that bar<br>
us from That Moment ~ in the Now<br>
Freedom is free of these somehow<br>
<br>
No no, say no, to all impure<br>
let go, let God, and so endure<br>
silence desires when they shout,<br>
your Self's within ~ even without<br>
<br>
Yet burdens might a blessing be-<br>
are undulations rocking thee?<br>
Or are you Rock, unmoved, unbound<br>
as these illusions crash around?<br>
<br>
A measure of ourselves you see<br>
is just how peaceful we can be<br>
when pushed about by our inflations<br>
by myths and Maya- Life's undulations<br>
<br>
We've come to Earth to Learn to Love<br>
Her Grace is raining from above<br>
as empty Cups we can be filled<br>
yet in God's time, as He so willed<br>
<br>
And when at last we let it go<br>
commit ourselves to God and so<br>
relinquish the myth of self-control<br>
then God takes over life and Soul<br>
<br>
And when our Spirit becomes the Doer<br>
when we do nothing, we are pure<br>
immortal hollow reed we'll be<br>
then as He plays us we will see<br>
<br>
That all that's gone and been before<br>
and all the myths that we endure<br>
were there because we had false needs<br>
tormented by insatiable greeds<br>
<br>
And yet alone untouched and true<br>
that Pure Desire that slept in you<br>
witnessed desires that made you bleed<br>
lay dormant as your Silent Seed<br>
<br>
Until that great and promised day<br>
when you awoke to truly say<br>
"My God I am Thy grateful son<br>
surrendered now ~ Thy Will Be Done"<br>
<br>
This was no shortage you have had<br>
these undulations you'll be glad<br>
have showered you now with a grin<br>
you've found without, our Wealth's within<br>
<br>
The myth of having more or less<br>
was just a drama now confess<br>
for in your Self, you truly see<br>
Source always was protecting thee.<br>
<br>
Our whole life's purpose is Divine<br>
sometimes we Grapes are pressed for Wine<br>
that He may quaff our Bliss to see<br>
how Shakti the Shiva, shines in me ~<br>
<br>
To Realise God, our Spirit pure<br>
full freedom, choice, we must endure<br>
until at last, when truly Free,<br>
God's own Reflection, we must Be<br>
<br>
Then money matters not to thee<br>
thy Heart open, always will be,<br>
and She fulfills, Eternal Youth ~<br>
Eternal Wealth ~ Eternal Truth ~.<br>
