<p>
You look above you high -<br>
Your sight is lost in sky,<br>
You see beneath your feet<br>
All green and lovely land<br>
But further you should see<br>
Where land is meeting sea:<br>
They shine with blinding light -<br>
The dangerous quicksands<br>
<br>
Choose your way, stay away<br>
Once you step into that<br>
Mass of sand closes in<br>
Over top of your head<br>
Choose your way, go around<br>
Forewarn can be seen<br>
There are steps coming in<br>
And no steps going out!<br>
No way out!<br>
<br> 
Sometimes the way of wrong<br>
Seems powerful and strong<br>
And shield of Inner Truth<br>
Feels heavy in your hands<br>
But stick to rightful way,<br>
And never step astray<br>
Because the way of wrong<br>
Leads straight into quicksands<br>
<br>
Choose your way, stay away<br>
Once you step into that<br>
Mass of sand closes in<br>
Over top of your head<br>
Choose your way, go around<br>
Forewarn can be seen<br>
There are steps coming in<br>
And no steps going out!<br>
No way out!
