<p>
One fine morning, down the street,<br>
An elephant I chanced to meet:<br>
"Good day", I said, and trying to pass<br>
Spoiled my shoes in the dewy grass.<br>
<br>
(For he filled the sidewalk, where<br>
He stood without a thought or care.)<br>
<br>
"Excuse me sir. I'm late for work!"<br>
I shouted up, a bit berserk.<br>
"If I'm not there by half-passed eight<br>
'I'II loose my job for being late!"<br>
<br>
(But he pretended not to hear<br>
And simply smiled from ear-to-ear.)<br>
<br>
"What's wrong with elephants these days?!"<br>
I cursed, my liver now ablaze.<br>
"Don't you watch the stock-exchange?!"<br>
"Time is money! Life is change!"<br>
<br>
(He waved his ears and gave a yawn<br>
And nodded to the rising sun.)<br>
<br>
"I've sweated all my life to be<br>
"Important in the company!<br>
"No elephant will make me stop<br>
"My ardent race to reach the top!"<br>
<br>
(With his trunk he picked a rose<br>
And pushed it up against my nose.)<br>
<br>
"Listen here you thoughtless brute,<br>
"Perhaps you think you're being cute<br>
"But you'd better face the fact:<br>
"You're holding evolution back!"<br>
<br>
At this remark he seemed to grow<br>
And over me, a shadow throw;<br>
A shadow cool and comforting<br>
I wondered what was happening.<br>
<br>
Just then I noticed in his eyes<br>
A clear blue depth, like endless skies.<br>
And did, or did I not there see<br>
Al life, all hope, all destiny?<br>
<br>
Suddenly I seemed to wake<br>
And gave myself a good, strong shake<br>
"What is ... where am . . . how did . . .?" said I.<br>
"Where is that god who made me cry?"<br>
<br>
(Then wiping tears from both my eyes<br>
I stepped back in great surprise.)<br>
<br>
For there before me on the walk<br>
A little child s t o o d looking up.<br>
With head just slightly to one side<br>
He sweetly watched my melting pride.<br>
<br>
(I felt embarrassed by his gaze<br>
Which read me like the sun's pure rays.)<br>
<br>
With smile playing on his lips<br>
He quickly turned, and off he skipped.<br>
Was it my heart that, by his whim,<br>
Ran that day along with him?<br>
<br>
That was a long, long time ago.<br>
And though today I'm grey and old<br>
I feel t h a t child within me still.<br>
And gratefully, I always will.<br>
</p>
