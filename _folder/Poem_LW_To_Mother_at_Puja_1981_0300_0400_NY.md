<p>
Mother you are my heart,<br>
You can give us food,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You are our heart,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You give us love,<br>
And we give You flowers and honey,<br>
And yoghurt and sugar and flowers again.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Mother you are our God,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And we give you presents,<br>
And Kumkum and the mirror that you bought,<br>
And a blessed comb to comb<br>
Your beautiful hair,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I love Your beautiful hair,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Because it is golden and silver<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and beautiful colours,<br>
We love you very much, Mother.<br>
</p>
