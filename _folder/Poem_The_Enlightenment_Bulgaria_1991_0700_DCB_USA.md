<p>
Remoting in infinity of Space,<br>
A tiny mote of Mother Earth;<br>
"Who am l? Where's God? Why like that?"<br>
I've asked, but answer haven't heard.<br>
<br>
And shot up the spring of yore,<br>
l've gone so slowly, pathless.<br>
Where have I been in times past born,<br>
Thrown out now in this dark recess?<br>
<br>
What is my connection with others?<br>
Why are others so much merciless?<br>
Why can't we be like brothers?<br>
Why not all of us be only smile?<br>
<br>
But suddenly a lightning tore the darkness<br>
And She came into view - The Heaven Brightness.<br>
The Mother of Divine steps on the Earth<br>
And gathered us forever through rebirth.<br>
<br>
To be united in a real whole,<br>
Just hand in hand, and eye in eye.<br>
The Soul is changing in a Loving Dove;<br>
At such a miracle even devil is tongue-tied!<br>
<br>
Let dear friends kneel down humbly,<br>
In all humility to thank, because<br>
Of blessing transformation lovely<br>
And link with the everlasting source.<br>
<br>
The Golden Goddess now is arisen in us;<br>
And never, never more the karmas be.<br>
So let in greatest hope repeat by voice:<br>
JAY! JAY! JAY SHRI MATAJI!<br>
</p>
