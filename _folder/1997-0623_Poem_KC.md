<p>
"Go thoughtless" used to be a great "idea".<br>
It never worked, I wasn't in that state.<br>
I tried and tried to do it, now it's clear<br>
It only works when "I" am separate,<br>
Connected constantly with that great Power<br>
Which is the Self, is Atma, is eternal -<br>
Chaitanya, Paramatma, Boundless Love.<br>
Shri Mataji, Oh Mother, always there,<br>
The thoughtless state must always be AWARE.<br>
</p>
