<p>
Al the children of the world,<br>
Every boy and every girl,<br>
Give a bandhan, don't you cry,<br>
Hanumana smiles nearby!<br>
<br>
Lord of Angels, see Him fly<br>
Through the wide and windy sky,<br>
Call His name and you will fee<br>
All your pain and sorrow heal.<br>
<br>
Al the children of the world,<br>
Every boy and every girl,<br>
Give a bandhan, don't you cry,<br>
Hanumana smiles nearby!<br>
<br>
Stronger than ten Supermans,<br>
He lifts mountains with His hands.<br>
With His happy monkey jokes,<br>
He turns egos into smoke.<br>
<br>
Al the children of the world,<br>
Every boy and every girl,<br>
Give a bandhan, don't you cry,<br>
Hanumana smiles nearby!<br>
<br>
When you sleep and when you play,<br>
He is there both night and day.<br>
If you share your love and toys,<br>
He will fill your heart with joy.<br>
<br>
Al the children of the world<br>
Every boy and every girl,<br>
Give a bandhan, don't you cry,<br>
Hanumana smiles nearby!<br>
<br>
Hanumana smiles nearby,<br>
In the Earth and in the sky,<br>
In your school and in your home,
In the wind and in this poem.<br>
