<br>

<p>
What if the babbling brook was not permitted to babble?<br>
Nor the whispering wind able to sigh<br>
What if there was never any opposition?<br>
No friction, no resistance, no struggle<br>
What if all the stones were as the river rocks; Smooth, even and flat<br>
What if we loved our spirit more than our life?<br>
Then what prayers would we need?<br>
The play continues, the wheel turns<br>
And we feel that we have never been here before<br>
We fear tomorrow, as we fear the unknown<br>
We hold fast to the wavering reed<br>
As the current of false impression glides over us,<br>
Here in this stream of life.<br>
