<p>
I long to fill my bucket with sky<br>
But for the holes - bucket would be full<br>
So, I pray to the divine to fix my buckets' holes<br>
So that I may feel its fullness<br>
<br>
Wonderful sky, you are peace and tranquility<br>
Even in your rage / have never seen you cast a cloud to<br>
the ground<br>
And, I watch how you hold the sun and hide your<br>
stars until you tire<br>
Then gently put the sun down, allowing again the stars<br>
to shine<br>
<br>
I see you everywhere<br>
Everywhere, except in my bucket with holes<br>
There is only emptiness there<br>
Emptiness and longing<br>
<br>
What would it be to have wisdom?<br>
To lose sight of emptiness and longing<br>
To lose sight and be full<br>
Oh, Divine, please fix my buckets' holes<br>
</p>
