<p>
Teatralnaya, a name poetic to Irish ears.<br>
<br>
Moscow, sunny mid September afternoon<br>
Teatralnaya, where we met.<br>
She'd traveled seventeen hours from Zhiguli.<br>
<br>
We walked around Red Square<br>
She, four red roses in her hand,<br>
I experienced emotions previously unknown<br>
Joy, completion, satisfaction.<br>
<br>
Twenty five years later, still the same.<br>
<br>
In the ethereal light of a new day<br>
I see her face beside me.<br>
The most beautiful I've ever seen.<br>
<br>
A gift from God<br>
From the Adi Shakti Herself.<br>
