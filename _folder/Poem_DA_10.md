<p align="center">
On a lake I'm drifting.<br>
When a wind begins to blow my craft at will.<br>
The moon silhouettes on the lake, the trees upon the shore, and sounds of wildness pervade<br>
the skies.<br>
While drifting on my boat, without oars.<br>
Which heading should I take?<br>
Possibilities satiate my head.<br>
All in a feeble attempt, to preserve the self, within.<br>
Yet in the end I must concede to the will of the wind.<br>
For anything else is but a fallacy entertained.<br>
Gazing into the water.<br>
Distorted likenesses of my face I perceive. Emotions of helplessness surmount me. While<br>
drifting on this boat with merely me. Somehow, I must surrender this kismet.<br>
To the forces that eternally be.<br>
While the wind blows upon the lake.<br>
And the moon makes silhouettes of the trees. I must discern the corporeality of life.<br>
While on this lake, alone, with merely me.<br>
</p>
