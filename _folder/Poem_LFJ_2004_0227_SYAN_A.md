<br>

<p>
We are surrounded by angels<br>
Who have come from this earth,<br>
So giving; so loving<br>
It feels in this Her embrace<br>
Every bird, every tree<br>
Was put here by Her<br>
To give us this joy<br>
And join us in Her song<br>
There is no way of telling<br>
Of the beauty of this place<br>
This Universe we are in<br>
At Her lotus feet<br>
It overcomes me<br>
And my heart swells<br>
Like a well overflowing<br>
</p>

We very soon realised that we were not there purely by our own good fortune and long- time desire, but the fact that we were there was simply a very precious gift from our Holy Mother! Just to set foot there was an enormous privilege - we were on Holy Land.<br>
We were warmly greeted by our dear teachers and all of the staff. At first I felt these people were not real—they had such a beautiful dignity and vibrations. It was as if they had been sent by Her directly from heaven, or had emerged from the earth. These were my thoughts: [Poem above follows.]"</list-item>
