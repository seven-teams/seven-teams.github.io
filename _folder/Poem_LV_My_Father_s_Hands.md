<br>

<p>
His hands were broad and square, articulate and clever<br>
Cracked and blackend from years immersed in grease<br>
And solvents - while solving internal combustion problems<br>
Left his nails hard as horn, and fissures running down to the moons.<br>
<br>
His tools precisely hung above his bench of kerosine-soaked wood.<br>
His overalls smelt of petrol and hot metal<br>
His spectacles were pitted by sparks<br>
His thumbs pierced each day by fine metal filings.<br>
<br>
And in the evenings, by the kitchen fire, with fine tweezers<br>
Or a needle, together we would work them out.<br>
Then he showed me how to knit.<br>
</p>
