<p>
Mother how do I sing your prayers?<br>
You are the nourisher, Protector of the world<br>
Remover of all obstacles,<br>
The One who does away with all sorrows and fears.<br>
But I am ignorant of all these high ideas and talks<br>
For me, You are simply the Beloved Mother.<br>
Mother how do I sing Your prayers?<br>
<br>
You have lifted us above the gods,<br>
Revealed to the essence of Mahadev<br>
Shown to us the conjunction of Shiva with Shakti<br>
Led us on the path to Sadashiv<br>
Illuminated our inner self and world<br>
Mother You have given all this to us just like that!<br>
<br>
Me the mantra-bound and innocent child,<br>
I know nothing of this high talk<br>
I simply like your incomparable look.<br>
Your lovely bindi, Your unending compassion,<br>
For me, You remain the beloved Mother.<br>
Mother how do I sing Your prayers?<br>
<br>
What is this small talk of Manipur and Anahat?<br>
We have left behind these rituals of the chakras,<br>
Having risen above the seven heavens<br>
We now control the fate of the twelve Adityas.<br>
Rooted firmly in the enlightened sangha.<br>
We are mast and enraptured with Chaitanya<br>
<br>
Fully satiated are Your children,<br>
Grateful eternally for your motherly love.<br>
We wish our lives be added to Yours, because<br>
Incomparably soothing is the shade of Your saree<br>
You are the princess with adorable countenance<br>
But you above all are my most Beloved Mother,<br>
Mother how do I sing Your prayers?<br>
</p>
