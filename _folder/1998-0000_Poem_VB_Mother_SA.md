<p>
Nirmala Her name,<br>
The Devi who came<br>
Her vibrations are our aim,<br>
With a bright flame,<br>
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi She became,<br>
Then She started playing Her holy game.<br>
She started with one,<br>
The world became one,<br>
Sahaja Yoga is the one,<br>
The pure and true one.<br>
</p>
