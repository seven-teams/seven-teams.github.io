<p>
I saw an old man put a little sweet between her lips<br>
more tenderly<br>
than ever he would have done when they were young.<br>
It is a secret of senescence<br>
to have learned how<br>
to care for the beloved.<br>
It is the wisdom of innocence. Children can show us<br>
such direct tenderness.<br>
</p>
