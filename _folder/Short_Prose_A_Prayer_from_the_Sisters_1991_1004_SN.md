<p>
Oh Most Beloved Shri Mother, loving salutations and best wishes for Your continued good health!<br>
<br>
Your daughters entreat You, grant us Your powers of love.<br>
<br>
Help us to learn and embody all the qualities we need for our ascent and for the well-being of our Sahaja family. Help us to wash away those things detrimental to the collective.<br>
<br>
Let us realise Your unlimited joy, peace and compassion. Let us be a real source of joy, peace and compassion.<br>
<br>
Let us recognise the imbalance and error of criticism, impatience, expectations and judgmentalism. Allow us to be fully content with the blessings You most lovingly and generously send our way. For this, may we be humbleand wholly surrendered to Your Divine Play. Please grant us patience and forbearance. Let us be alert.<br>
<br>
Please illuminate our brain with the Pure Light of the Spirit. Please grant us pure attention so that this Light permeates all that which our attention touches. Please l e t the seekers of ages recognise this Light.<br>
<br>
Let us fully realise our relationship with You and with our brothers, sisters, husbands and children. Allow us the depth and strength to nurture these relationships properly.<br>
<br>
In our love and devotion to our eldest brother, Lord shri Ganesha, may we establish our innocence, chastity, wisdom and discrimination. We pray that His powers help us to become the best that we can be and thereby please You. Please allow us the joy and privilege of becoming hollow instruments for Your Most Holy Orchestration.<br>
<br>
Shri Mataji, with all our heart and soul, we love You.<br>
<br>
Shri Mother, with our very breath we dedicate to You.<br>
<br>
Only with You are we complete. Only with You are we in joy. Only wit h You can we ascend as Your offering to the Resplendent Lotus Feet of our father, Lord Sadashiva. May Your son, our brother, pave the way for our Holy journey out of the mire and into Your Loving Grace.<br>
<br>
We desire only to be with You, one and all, part and parcel. That is all.<br>
</p>
