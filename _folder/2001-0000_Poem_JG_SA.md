<p>
You are my dearest friend,<br>
A melodious song in legend.<br>
You are at the root of my life,<br>
Union with you forever, is my strife.<br>
<br>
Your beauty is dazzlingly splendid,<br>
You are the world's support indeed.<br>
Your eyes are deep like sea,<br>
Your words are nectar to me.<br>
<br>
The day I came across you,<br>
I came across myself too.<br>
What's to gain and what's to lose,<br>
Since I've left nothing to choose?<br>
<br>
The more I merge into you,<br>
The more I get to unfold you.<br>
It must be my merits earlier<br>
That have given the fruits so rare.<br>
<br>
I pray from the depth of my mind,<br>
Let us know you Mother, be kind.<br>
Then there'll be no tumult anywhere,<br>
But benevolence and serenity's rule everywhere
</p>
