<p>
Grass is humble, always grass.<br>
So that we'd know it anywhere –<br>
Africa or Italy, walking<br>
In and our of time.<br>
Blink, and a century is gone.<br>
The whole delicate web that makes<br>
a world – intricate,<br>
insistent as this pulse<br>
inside my wrist –<br>
continues without effort.<br>
<br>
There's no weariness now,<br>
no sense that I must shoulder guilt,<br>
assume responsibility.<br>
I have put down the world, grown lighter.<br>
I have become 'brightface'.<br>
The spirit moves within,<br>
and in and out of time:<br>
this life, that one;<br>
rich, poor; speaking English<br>
or a tongue I have never dreamed<br>
my lips could find as familiar as fruit.<br>
<br>
No matter where, or how,<br>
only the why:<br>
that I should grow within,<br>
the ‘I' that is this humble spirit,<br>
swift as grass, humble,<br>
certain – everywhere grass,<br>
under the bright and changeless sky.<br>
</p>
