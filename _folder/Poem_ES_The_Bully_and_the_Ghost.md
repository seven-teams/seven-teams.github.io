<p>
The Earth where we live is a very old place.<br>
She has seen many things come and go.<br>
From the left to the right, and right to the left,<br>
The people have moved, fast and slow.<br>
<br>
Here is a story about someone who's left,<br>
And someone who went very right.<br>
And how, when they met, everything for them changed<br>
And they came to the centre of Light...<br>
<br>
There once was a boy called Billy the Bull<br>
Who walked with his nose in the air.<br>
And when someone tried to show him their love,<br>
He said that, I"really don't care!"<br>
<br>
But deep down inside Billy cared very much<br>
And he wanted to show that he cared;<br>
But when he was small he was hurt and abused,<br>
And now he was angry and scared.<br>
<br>
Every time big, bad Billy went out in the world<br>
To find someone small to pick on,<br>
He hid in his heart a big ocean of love,<br>
And wished that the hate was all gone.<br>
<br>
One lonely night, as he lay in his bed,<br>
Billy felt he's the worst in the world.<br>
And as he sat up to shout out his shame,<br>
He saw the small shape of a girl.<br>
<br>
"What-who are you?" asked the boy in the dark.<br>
But the little white shape hid and cried,<br>
Till he walked 'cross the room and sat on the floor<br>
And told her to sit by his side.<br>
<br>
There in the dark, on the cold bedroom floor,<br>
Sat the bully and the white fairy.<br>
Billy was trying to stay calm and strong,<br>
But really he found her quite scary.<br>
<br>
"You need not fear me", came her quivering voice,<br>
I'm a soul who has gone from this Earth.<br>
When I was alive I was treated so bad<br>
That I left, for I had little worth."<br>
<br>
And as she moved o'er, as fi to fly of,<br>
Billy begged her to stay and cheer-up.<br>
Just because you were hurt, it's no reason to die.<br>
Why didn't you fight and bear up?"<br>
<br>
"You think it is better to fight like a fool?"<br>
Asked the shimmering shape by his side.<br>
"It is better to run and hide from the world,<br>
Than show-off your hate and false pride."<br>
<br>
"What do you mean? Running off is for fools!"<br>
But before he could say any more<br>
The room filled with golden, grand, sunny, warm Light,<br>
And the children were filled with great awe!<br>
<br>
Before them, a Boy with an elephant's head<br>
And the crown and the jewels of a king,<br>
Stood smiling and shining like sun on a stream<br>
With joy and sweet love o'erflowing.<br>
<br>
"Take not to heart, all the pain that you've lived.<br>
The dark ages of fear are to end.<br>
For, coming to Earth, is the Mother's sweet Realm.<br>
All the wounds and dark thoughts, She will mend!"<br>
<br>
"Little sister, fly up now and wait till you're called.<br> 
A dear family is waiting for you.<br>
You'll come back, a baby in loving, warm arms<br>
In a world with hearts clear and true!"<br>
<br>
"And my brother, you've also been lonely too long.<br>
Come with me and I'll show you the times<br>
That are coming to Earth, when innocence shines,<br>
And all heart-songs, together, will rhyme!"<br>
<br>
And up they did fly through great, wondrous dreams,<br>
Till the whole world was laughing with joy.<br>
Then down Billy bounced, into his soft bed,<br>
Where he cuddled his favorite of toys.<br>
<br>
When he awoke, with the sun in his eyes,<br>
He looked out to see the new world.<br>
Deep in his heart he saw, for the first time,<br>
New hope shine for each boy and girl.<br>
