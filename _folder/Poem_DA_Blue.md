<br>

<p>
In times remembered<br>
When feeling down<br>
Your essence comes upon me<br>
Laying my troubles down<br>
<br>
Against a bloom<br>
Between green leaves<br>
Your shades of feelings<br>
Creep down deep inside me<br>
<br>
Blue, in an afternoon sky<br>
Lingering in the meadow<br>
Or at the bow of a knoll<br>
I see you resting, fondling the pasture<br>
<br>
Blue, without a sound<br>
Hurling shades and hues<br>
Penetrating a hush<br>
Enmeshing quietly<br>
<br>
In reflections on calm water<br>
Or upon soothed souls<br>
Within placid eyes<br>
Blue, your beauty I behold<br>
<br>
Together today and tomorrow<br>
Blue, I will drink you. I will breathe you in<br>
I will watch you riding the sunrise<br>
And I will join you at the gathering of clouds<br>
</p>
