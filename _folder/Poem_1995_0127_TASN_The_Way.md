<p>
In innocence lies our support<br>
with wisdom to our brother,<br>
Whilst just above, coils of pure love,<br>
abides the holy Mother.<br>
When pure desire to take us higher<br>
calls Her to evolution<br>
Then movement starts, towards our hearts<br>
spirals in revolution.<br>
So first must ask, most Holy task<br>
for knowledge pure and true<br>
The Way to see, become and be<br>
begins as we find You.<br>
And so we grow, begin to go<br>
across the void with You<br>
Encounter storms, master the norms<br>
we sail with our Guru.<br>
Until at last, through tempest's blast<br>
we reach the farthest shore<br>
Dharrna endures, heart's Peace secures<br>
and Joy flows evermore.<br>
Oh blissful flight, we stand in light<br>
and find our heart's on fire<br>
Still up above, we find the Dove<br>
She waits to take us higher.<br>
My God did You, see such a view<br>
we see the whole Virata<br>
We see the Play, of night and day<br>
This dance of Holy Mata.<br>
So through the Door, we pass in awe<br>
and blend With Christ in Oneness<br>
We see that He, humility<br>
is Light that now becomes us.<br>
To take our seat, Her Lotus Feet<br>
we prostrate low before them<br>
Her Holy powers have made us flowers<br>
She offers up before Him.<br>
<br>
We are flowers in the garden<br>
of Her holy Sahasrara<br>
Created by the Shakti,<br>
as puja to Shiva.<br>
