<p>
Stand in the flow of Divine Vibrations<br>
Stand in the Attention of our Mother<br>
Focus on the true expression of your powers as Saint,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;as Sahaji,<br>
You can change, help, Love other people<br>
Set your attention back into Sahasrara in a second<br>
Help someone awaken his Kundalini<br>
With only a bandhan or a prayer,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;you can correct your child<br>
Say ‘No!’ to destructive thoughts or attitudes<br>
Your physical contribution to any project<br>
&emsp;&emsp;makes a difference in its success and beauty<br>
This brings depth to our meditation,<br>
Silent but dynamic,<br>
Sensitive to Vibrations,<br>
With devotion,<br>
Joy...<br>
One is always inspired by such yogis,<br>
They carry that strength within themselves.<br>
Stand in the Middle Path.<br>
</p>
