<p>
Slow down my busy brain, behave!<br>
It's time you changed! You're not the slave<br>
Of every dark, conditioned thought<br>
That rises from the past unsought:<br>
You're not an engine shuffling facts<br>
And shaping them to future acts;<br>
Nor yet a pendulum that scans<br>
The tos and fros from past to plans.<br>
Each time you swing from "What's to do"<br>
To "What's been done" you flicker through<br>
The precious present, wherein lies<br>
A glint of God's great enterprise.<br>
If we could stretch that moment where<br>
You're thoughtless, still, and yet aware,<br>
Then we, my brain, might start to sense<br>
Creation's vast magnificence.<br>
Oh Mother, slow my bustling brain:<br>
Detach it from the brash, insane,<br>
Dishonest, pampering, uncouth<br>
Illusions that conceal the truth:<br>
And Mother, that I might fulfil<br>
My part of the Creator's ill,<br>
In-turn my mind and teach it how<br>
To live the ever-present now.<br>
</p>
