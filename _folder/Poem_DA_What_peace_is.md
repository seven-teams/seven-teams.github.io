<p>
Peril, doom and gloom<br>
Jealousy, plotting and revolt<br>
Words that have weight<br>
for those who measure, assess and contemplate<br>
<br>
But seek not "peace" within any action<br>
And certainly not through inaction<br>
<br>
"Peace" fi any thing is a state of being.<br>
The center of the storm<br>
A thing beyond words<br>
Nirvikalpa.....<br>
