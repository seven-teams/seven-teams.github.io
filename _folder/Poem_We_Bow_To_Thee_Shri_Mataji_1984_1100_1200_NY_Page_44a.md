<p>
Beyond time is the Spirit,<br>
&ensp;That, You've helped us become,<br>
For n o w w e know, that we are,<br>
&ensp;And what it is you've done.<br>
We bow to Thee, Shri Mataji,<br>
&ensp;The voice of God who speaks,<br>
From far beyond duality,<br>
&ensp;You guide the one who seeks.<br>
Evolving thus, through many lives,<br>
&ensp;Fighting what must be fought,<br>
With Your help, the seeker wins,<br>
&ensp;The victory he's sought.<br>
In winning, he surrenders,<br>
&ensp;Desires that come to him,<br>
He withdraws all his senses,<br>
&ensp;In Yoga goes within.<br>
There he finds, in Love with God<br>
&ensp;Heart's peace and joy, indeed,<br>
Becomes the bloom and the fruit,<br>
&ensp;You planted, as a seed.<br>
