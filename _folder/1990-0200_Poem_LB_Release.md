<p>
He emerged, walked free<br>
looking like an ordinary, sweet grandfather<br>
from the Eastern Cape:<br>
those lovely old men we children knew<br>
were wise and saintly,<br>
walking down the streets<br>
in ancient suits, greatcoats<br>
from the First World War. We always greeted,<br>
an exchange both courteous and right.<br>
<br>
Grown older, we salute Mandela.<br>
Not the bogeyman whose face<br>
was a forbidden sight (abroad,<br>
we looked in libraries); nor charismatic<br>
warrior, giving tongue in blood and flame.<br>
<br>
The heavens did not fall.<br>
But then, for days before, the mountain<br>
(struck by lightning) burned,<br>
the dark alive with crimson snakes<br>
writhing on air, black elevation of the night.<br>
<br>
Confirmation came<br>
less from our eyes, watching the images that flew<br>
about the world, than from the way we felt:<br>
elated, cool, not doubting this was true,<br>
the destined time and place.<br>
<br>
This is the way messiahs come -<br>
when time can stand no more delay,<br>
and people throng the streets, mill in the square,<br>
climb trees to see.<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Even the soldiers,<br>
nervous in the mob (since they alone are armed,<br>
and so not free) are part of the convergence,<br>
the dislocated, sudden calm of knowing:<br>
This was the way it had to be.<br>
