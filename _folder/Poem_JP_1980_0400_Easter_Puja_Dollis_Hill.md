<p>
Mother,<br>
Your Name is our Truth<br>
Your Love is our Support<br>
<br>
Mother,<br>
Your Words fill us with Joy<br>
May our Joy fill every Universe<br>
<br>
Mother<br>
W hat May we do but Serve You?<br>
What should we do but praise You?<br>
What can we do without You?<br>
<br>
Mother,<br>
Most Glorious You are<br>
And forever<br>
Mataji Nirmala Devi.<br>
