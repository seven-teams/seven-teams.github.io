<p>
We were sitting still at Her Lotus Feet,<br>
And the Time just stopped, and then it moved again,<br>
and then it rushed ahead with a tremendous speed<br>
And before our sight the whole Eternity came.<br>
<br>
The whole Eternity came and it was moving away,<br>
It was passing by like a rolling wave,<br>
And a sabre-tooth tiger we saw on its way<br>
And a primitive man in his ancient cave.<br>
<br>
Then from the Eyes of The Goddess<br>
the stars and planets came,<br>
while the ages were changing<br>
just like sunset and sunrise,<br>
<br>
And we saw that the Cosmos<br>
was all contained in Her eyes<br>
And that the whole Creation<br>
was all contained in Her eyes.
</p>

<b>From Bala Kanayson's memory:</b> "She just gazed at me and I felt as though I was being pulled into Her eyes.<br>
The next thing I knew, [...] I distinctly saw/heard/smelt/felt certain objects like a sabre-tooth tiger, the universe, planets, etc., until it came back to "the beginning."<br>
And then there was nothing, just nothing. And, in the middle of this nothing was Shri Mataji."</list-item>
