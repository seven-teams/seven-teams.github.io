<br>

<p>
Under a giant fissured limestone boulder,<br>
the goddess Ériu lies<br>
Her heart was pierced<br>
by remembrance of a grievous wrong<br>
Forgiveness was Her response<br>
The balm and succor of her distress<br>
<br>
Ireland suffered many long centuries<br>
Ireland, the center heart<br>
And the Hill of Uisneach<br>
The center heart of the center heart.<br>
<br>
A swayambhu, known by a mere handful<br>
Self-manifested, created by its own accord<br>
Born out of itself.<br>
<br>
Jai Shri Ériu, Victory to Ériu<br>
</p>

  <list-item color="BlanchedAlmond"  width="280"><b>2024-0203 Author's email:</b> "About sixteen yogis who live in Ireland, went to visit the Hill of Uisineach, in the precise geographical center of Ireland, It's a powerful swayambhu, a huge limestone boulder that was deposited during the last ice age. Under the boulder is said to be buried Eriu, a goddess, from which the name Erin, hence Ireland is derived. Thus, it is the center heart of the center heart. It's in the middle of a working farm, where the farmer allow visitors to come and pay respects. Seamus Harten, the Irish leader took us there. The Irish collective is small, but growing now thanks to yogis from India, Bulgaria, Spain, and other countries.</list-item>
  <list-item color="Lavender"  width="280"><b>2024-0204 Author's email:</b> Seamus Harten, leader of Sahaja Yoga in Ireland, had told me about Uisneach, a swayambhu in the geographical center of Ireland, and there, under a huge limestone boulder is said to be buried a goddess called Eriu. I wrote the poem and when we visited the site with about sixteen yogis, the vibrations were very powerful. A husband and wife lead tours of the site, and when I showed the wife my poem, she asked if she could frame a copy for their office wall, in which they sell books and T shirts. I was pleased to agree."</list-item>
