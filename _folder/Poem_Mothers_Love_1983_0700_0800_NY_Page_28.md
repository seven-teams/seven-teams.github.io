<p>
O! my beloved Mother!<br>
When I go out for work,<br>
I get heat of the world.br>
When I come back home,<br>
Your Love cools me down.<br>
Your love dissolves all that I gather,<br>
your love refreshes me.<br>
&emsp;When I get injury outside,<br>
When I come to you.<br>
I get healing touch of your love.<br>
The world though full of miseries,<br>
your love makes it peaceful.<br>
There is no place in the world to hide,<br>
when I come to you, you conceal me in<br>
your depth,<br>
You make me forget all the pangs and<br>
sufferings.<br>
There is no better place than your Lotus Feet,<br>
Where I find my sole refuge. I pray not only for me,<br>
but for the whole world.<br>
To extend your soothing Love to all<br>
To fill the whole Universe with your<br>
infinite joy, that you are.<br>
That who is infinite joy, Love, peace and<br>
beauty is going to make the whole creation<br>
manifested with His real nature, the eternal happiness.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Aum Amen<br>
