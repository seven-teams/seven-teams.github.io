<p>
Before Time was, You were my Lord<br>
You are, always will be<br>
You are the Lord of every thing<br>
You are Shri Ganapati<br>
<br>
You are first principle of all<br>
Innocence, undefiled<br>
And all that is, is part of You<br>
You are that divine child<br>
<br>
You are the thought, You are the scribe<br>
You are the tusk and hands<br>
You are the words, You are the ink<br>
You are That, which understands<br>
<br>
And You my Lord are Path and Goal<br>
You are the Sun each day<br>
You are the Dance, You are the Moon<br>
You are the Music ~ Play<br>
<br>
Yours is the circle and the square<br>
Yours is the movement too<br>
You are auspiciousness itself<br>
And You are all that's true<br>
<br>
You are the Spark in every child<br>
In every girl and boy<br>
You are their smiles and laughter<br>
You are their endless Joy<br>
<br>
And You are Love with pure desire<br>
That River ever flowing<br>
That washes clean, renews,<br>
invigorates our growing<br>
<br>
And You fix up, remove, refine<br>
so we become Your brothers<br>
You lead us on, show us the Way<br>
Her Lotus Feet ~ our Mother's<br>
<br>
Jai! Jai! Ganesh! You are the Guide<br>
The Path of pure desire<br>
Yours are the rope and goad to use<br>
Please lead us, ever Higher<br>
<br>
Maha Ganesh, You are the Lord<br>
You are, sweet Jesus, mild<br>
We pray, become, just like Him<br>
Pure Innocence, a Child<br>
<br>
Nought is there Lord You cannot do,<br>
Nought is there not in You<br>
You are my Lord, this very self<br>
All this, is only You.<br>
<br>
Before Time was, You were my Lord<br>
You are, always will be<br>
You are the Lord of every thing<br>
You are Shri Ganapati<br>
