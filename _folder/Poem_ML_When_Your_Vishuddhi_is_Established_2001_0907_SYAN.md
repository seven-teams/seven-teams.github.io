<p>
When you are having a lot of difficulties<br>
and, despite that, you stay in the Sahaj collective,<br>
your Vishuddhi is established.<br>
<br>
When you can see every event, bad or good,<br>
as a film shot in life and you are a spectator,<br>
your Vishuddhi is established.<br>
<br>
When someone insults you and you stay indifferent<br>
and donâ€™t react,<br>
your Vishuddhi is established.<br>
<br>
When people harm you by their speeches<br>
and you respond with the silence of a bandhan,<br>
even if you are right,<br>
your Vishuddhi is established.<br>
<br>
When a Sahaj brother, a Sahaj sister or anyone<br>
expresses to you his or her problems and, by your advice,<br>
you relieve him and calm his anxiety,<br>
your Vishuddhi is established.<br>
<br>
When you take the floor somewhere<br>
and people seem to hear a divine melody and relax,<br>
your Vishuddhi is established.<br>
<br>
When you dress properly<br>
without exposing the ultimate parts of your body,<br>
your Vishuddhi is established.<br>
<br>
When opening your mouth, you tell only the truth,<br>
your Vishuddhi is established.<br>
<br>
When you have something<br>
and you can share it with your brother, sister or anyone,<br>
without ego,<br>
your Vishuddhi is established.<br>
<br>
When you make people happy by your presence only,<br>
your Vishuddhi is established.<br>
<br>
When you can easily talk to someone about Sahaja Yoga,<br>
your Vishuddhi is established.<br>
<br>
When people are from the American continent<br>
and you have all these qualities ...<br>
America is established.<br>
