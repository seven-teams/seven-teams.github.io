<br>

<p>
She walked the Earth to gather jewels<br>
<br>
Rocks turned to gems by Her touch<br>
Wasted, misled and out of fuel<br>
But we renewed in Her attentive watch<br>
She placed a force within us deep<br>
It replenished us again and again<br>
She showed us love so no heart weeps<br>
No one had told us this way before<br>
<br>
A prophet came, a prophet passed<br>
But the Mother finally made us unite<br>
She brought to light their message wise<br>
Universal one religion pure<br>
She taught us so we may rise<br>
And establish love - hatred's cure<br>
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi is Her Name<br>
May Her children forward Her blissful domain<br>
