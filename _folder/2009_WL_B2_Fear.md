<p style="text-align:center;">
Where is my fear originating<br>
if not inside of me?<br>
<br>
How can it be that my fear is dominating me?<br>
What does it want to tell me? Is it justified?<br>
<br>
I want to conquer my fear<br>
and replace it with wisdom<br>
I want to silence the anger<br>
and replace it with love<br>
<br>
I want to know the danger<br>
but be able to dissolve it with compassion<br>
<br>
My mind is playing tricks with me<br>
But so is my heart<br>
<br>
My emotions are getting in the way<br>
of me being myself<br>
But so is my brain<br>
<br>
My memories spell insecurity<br>
And my plans are too ambitious<br>
<br>
But<br>
<br>
When I go to the silent lotus<br>
wisdom, love and compassion start to flow<br>
penetrating my heart, making sense of memories<br>
<br>
When I go to the silent lotus<br>
my fears seem so silly<br>
that laughter replaces the anger<br>
<br>
I feel secure within myself<br>
And allow intuition to guide me to the future<br>
<br>
Love and silence fill my heart and mind
