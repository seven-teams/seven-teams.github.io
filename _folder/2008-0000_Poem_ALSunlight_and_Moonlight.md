<p>
Sunlight and Moonlight fail to remove the darkness of confusion and ignorance,<br>
But the Light that emanates from Your Lotus Feet, O Mother,<br>
fills the whole Universe with the shine of Truth.<br>
<br>
Please put Your Lotus Feet into our hearts, Dear Mother,<br>
so, we may see the Truth with the eyes of our hearts,<br>
Not with the eyes of our minds,<br>
which are lost in a play of Sunlight and Moonlight.
</p>
