<br>

<p>
The air is heavy<br>
Yet not so dense as to hold me high<br>
The sight that fills my eyes<br>
The thought that fills my mind<br>
Is love?<br>
But this love draws "fear" near<br>
<br>
High on a plank<br>
I stare a 20 feet towards the ground<br>
And being not sure of my balance,<br>
I lay frozen<br>
Watching moments elapse by<br>
<br>
Sometimes it seems better<br>
To lay frozen with fear<br>
Than to shirk off fear and take a chance<br>
After all what is balance, but poise and lack of fear.<br>
<br>
This six inch plank is now my path, narrow without options<br>
Such a simple innocence path, that leads to over there.<br>
But, what wish and wanting, incites ones desire to travel there?<br>
What lack of contentment motivates one to leave?<br>
<br>
Life is a passageway of desires<br>
Desires that are consumed every day<br>
For without desire there would be no life.<br>
And I, otherwise would be satisfied<br>
To lay here frozen on this plank and not venture past fear.<br>
</p>
