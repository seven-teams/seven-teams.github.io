<p>
Buddha and Mahavira:<br>
two princes seeking the essential Self<br>
discarded kingdoms, wives and children<br>
even wealth: became reflective, solitary. They<br>
both rejected sacrifices and parades of piety<br>
as methods of discovering the Deity.<br>
Each searched within<br>
to find the all-pervading Self<br>
<br>
Kindness and pity for their fellow man<br>
inspired them to share<br>
their path to truth.<br>
Imagine their dismay to see now<br>
all their loving plans distorted:<br>
simple truths contorted to religious rites;<br>
even idols, manufactured in their likeness -<br>
tools for oppression -<br>
in the hands of priests.<br>
<br>
Imagine Socrates or Lao Tse, consoling them, might say:<br>
"It was the same for us. But what you did was quite correct.<br>
The human ego always was so tough.<br>
See how steam-power added madness<br>
to their lust for speed.<br>
Their minds have run amok;<br>
they love to name and claim things as their own.<br>
Even the stars, once viewed with awe<br>
can excite avarice today in men.<br>
<br>
You did the best you could," says Socrates.<br>
"No-one can find the words in any tongue<br>
to perfectly convey what we all know as 'One'<br>
that which I called the 'Self'<br>
which Lao Tse in his time has called the 'Tao - Mother of us all'<br>
and Moses called - the name unspeakable - 'Yahweh'<br>
Which Buddha tried not to give any name; Mahavira also did the same.<br>
<br>
It makes no difference to the human race. But soon<br>
enough of them will see the vein of gold<br>
which ran through all our lives.<br>
When that day comes they'll finally evolve."<br>
