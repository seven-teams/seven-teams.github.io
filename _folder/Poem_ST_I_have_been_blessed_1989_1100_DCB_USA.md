<br>
I have been blessed!<br>
Beyond the expectations of the saints.<br>
I have been raised from out the mire<br>
Of temporal impurity.<br>
<br>
I know not why these blessings<br>
Fall upon my insubstantial self.<br>
Nor why She called me forth<br>
Out of the mists of comfortable obscurity.<br>
<br>
I only know that what was once<br>
A dream, a vague and flimsy paradox,<br>
Has blossomed forth upon my waiting<br>
Self - A Shining light of certainty.<br>
<br>
I have been blessed.<br>
My spirit and the Holy Ghost<br>
Have danced upon the grave of my unrighteousness.<br>
I lie, a new born babe, a product of divine maternity.<br>
<br>
I hear you call my brethren.<br>
I yearn to share the fellowship of long lost kin.<br>
We ail are cells within the one divine.<br>
A twice born joyous laity.<br>
<br>
I have been blessed.<br>
My hands detect the miracle of heaven's breeze.<br>
The love of God reverberates within my spine:<br>
It is a vibrant, sanctified and living deity.<br>
<br>
I have been blessed.
