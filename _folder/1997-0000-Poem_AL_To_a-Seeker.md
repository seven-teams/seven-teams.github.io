<p>
In morning light when stars are pale<br>
You long to leave the nest<br>
And then your journey sets the sail<br>
For your eternal quest<br>
Across the seas and mountain heights<br>
So many roads go<br>
But only one that reaches the Truth<br>
Resides inside of you.<br>
<br> 
In rainy days you see the drops<br>
But cannot see the way;<br>
In piles of books you read the words<br>
But meaning slips away<br>
Across the seas and mountain heights<br>
So many roads go<br>
But only one that reaches the Truth<br>
Resides inside of you.<br>
<br> 
In sea of Love the Time is still<br>
And waves of spirit shine<br>
And in the depth of heart you feel<br>
The presence of Divine<br>
Across the seas and mountain heights<br>
So many roads go<br>
But only one that reaches the Truth<br>
Resides inside of you.<br>
</p>
