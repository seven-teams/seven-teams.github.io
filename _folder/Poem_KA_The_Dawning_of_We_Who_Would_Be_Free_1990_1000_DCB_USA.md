<p>
Ohl The urgency of blood madly pounding in the brain,<br>
Desire burning a quick agonizing flame.<br>
Lurid eyes leering in the half light.<br>
Gouache limpets in the stream.<br>
Biting fighting screaming; horrors of the dream.<br>
<br>
Oh: The urgency of humans forcing through, momentum drawn;<br>
Battle scarred, frustrate, weary, echoes of the past begone:<br>
The time has come, it's here and now: God's Kingdom is for thee.<br>
Judgment time is upon us: We who would be free.<br>
Away there in the distance, the great swayambhus rise,<br>
Vibrating in their glory: Ganesha forms<br>
materialize as waves upon the sea,<br>
Frozen their peaks; for all eternity.<br>
The power is their story; pulsating the forms,<br>
The monoliths, the standing stones,<br>
Vibrating with the dawn of the Aquarians:<br>
<br>
Hosanna: Hosanna: Arise: We who are reborn.<br>
Kundalini glowing, Almighty Lava flows, engulfing all the sworn.<br>
The time has come, it's here and now: God's kingdom is for thee.<br>
Judgment time is upon us and we are the blossoms on<br>
The tree of life and this life is full and free.<br>
Become the stream of love and peace flowing to the sea,<br>
The ocean of this love is for all eternity;<br>
Be free: be free: be free:
</p>
