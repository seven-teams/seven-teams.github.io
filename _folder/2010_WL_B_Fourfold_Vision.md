<p style="text-align:center;">
Fourfold Vision<br>
is a state of my mind<br>
in which aspects of any given issue<br>
present themselves in four dimensions<br>
<br>
Four dimensions bring a state of bliss and joy<br>
as truth brings beauty to my sight<br>
Time is like a field of flowers, meanings but a cloud<br>
<br>
Three dimensions when I rest<br>
Dreams are not bound by contradictions<br>
<br>
Three dimensions even when my mind is still<br>
Silence fills my brain with clarity without a thought<br>
Judgments are lost in the flattened realm of rationality<br>
Happiness and sadness fade away<br>
<br>
As long as I am awake and free<br>
two dimensions of any given issue<br>
will always be present in my heart and mind<br>
<br>
May the divine prevent me<br>
from seeing something with a singular vision<br>
with disregard to wisdom, disregard to an awakened mind
