<p align="center">
Pale white feather Slipping from high places<br>
Your decent so beautiful Upon invisible flows<br>
<br>
I wait for words to come<br>
From within unknown regions<br>
<br>
Carrying your flight<br>
Through cryptic spaces within my mind<br>
<br>
Until you settle my heart will stir Among those frenzied leaves upon the green willows<br>
bent by the currents you ride<br>
Willows unable to know their desires Inclined to bend<br>
As fragile youths languishing for wisdom Sold as fragments of time<br>
Pale white feather<br>
Who left those many plumes To sail without aim<br>
Such as I<br>
A bond we share<br>
For love of the invisible flows<br>
That carries us over the golden fields<br>
While we listen to the sounds of other's lives<br>
</p>
