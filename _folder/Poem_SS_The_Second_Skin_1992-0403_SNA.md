<p>
This one is not<br>
The Sita of <i>Ramayana</i><br>
Nor from Ayodhya<br>
She is Sita from Chapel Street<br>
Hounslow Middlesex sick with<br>
Chronic heart disease<br>
When the nurse asked her to<br>
change<br>
Into something more comfortable<br>
Sita replied<br>
This is the most comfortable thing<br>
Next to my skin I have<br>
The sari is my second skin<br>
I would like to die wearing it<br>
It is my <i>pahchan</i> my identity<br>
Her husband standing nearby<br>
Smiled happily and told the nurse<br>
My dear<br>
Not very long ago<br>
But certainly long before you were born<br>
Some strange Englishmen went to<br>
India<br>
They wanted to turn Indians into<br>
Dark coloured Brits<br>
But they miserably failed<br>
You know why<br>
Because the Sitas of India<br>
Like this one<br>
Never discarded<br>
Their second skin<br>
</p>
