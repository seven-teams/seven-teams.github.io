<p style="text-align:center;">
The sun has hidden beyond the horizon<br>
Darkness envelops man and nature<br>
<br>
The stars give light from far<br>
Twinkling with joy but not enough to see<br>
the path in front of me<br>
<br>
The sun, though, has not left completely<br>
While warming man and nature on the other side<br>
the moon gives witness to its presence<br>
Reflecting light enough to see<br>
the path in front of me<br>
<br>
Reminds me of the spirit inside<br>
Reflecting the eternal in the darkest times<br>
<br>
With light enough<br>
to see the path for growth<br>
<br>
Until the sun dissolves the darkness yet again<br>
and man and nature can revel in its glow
</p>
