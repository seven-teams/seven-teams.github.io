<p style="text-align:center;">
The Mother gave me birth<br>
when I was 20 years of age<br>
She gave me life in a way<br>
I could never have imagined<br>
<br>
While I was waiting to be born<br>
She took care of me in subtle ways<br>
While I was looking for nutrition<br>
She nurtured me without me realizing<br>
<br>

After she gave me birth, my evolution started<br>
Brothers and sisters acted as mirrors for my growth<br>
The Mother held out her hand and guided many steps<br>
Protecting me by clearing obstacles before they harm<br>
Then slowly, she started weaning me from protection<br>
<br>
Inner evolution happens if we keep an open mind<br>
Inner evolution is required for growing strong<br>
<br>
Subtle changes give us knowledge<br>
Small mistakes, chances for corrections<br>
Thought patterns, if correct, give joy<br>
Thought patterns, if negative, give pain<br>
<br>
Thoughts, though, are fleeting<br>
They don’t survive for long<br>
<br>
But slowly<br>
with time and patience<br>
patterns do start to evolve<br>
Initiating change and growth<br>
<br>
Steps of inner evolution, though<br>
require times of silence<br>
<br>
Times of silence for patterns to be tested<br>
Times of silence for patterns to be strengthened or dissolved<br>
<br>
Real growth by evolution<br>
requires a flow of love throughout our being<br>
<br>
Love is the force<br>
which gives evolution its direction<br>
<br>
Love is the measure<br>
for how our evolution is progressing<br>
<br>
Love is how the Mother guides us<br>
towards a higher state
