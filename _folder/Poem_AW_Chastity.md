<p>
Johnny drives a Lamborghini<br>
It's a beauty to the eye<br>
But he'd never have the notion that<br>
At its fastest motion<br>
It can't move as fast as his Kundalini can rise<br>
<br>
He owns an apartment building,<br>
Been engaged three times,<br>
The women all loved him,<br>
But he sleeps alone at night<br>
<br>
Chastity is the foundation of dharma<br>
In dharma we sustain<br>
Joy, we become as little children<br>
See heaven in a wild flower.<br>
<br>
To advocate chastity now<br>
Offers a contradictory view<br>
A condition without apparent benefit<br>
It's joy beyond understanding but only once you experience it.<br>
<br>
The practiced air of wellbeing that all is well<br>
Is offered through a wafer thin veneer<br>
We exercise, express concern for climate change, the extinction of species,<br>
While electing politicians who represent only capital and the status quo.<br>
<br>
Even a child can see that despite their attempts at spiritual practice<br>
They swirl in depression's mist<br>
They talk about soul in a disconnect with spirit.<br>
Chastity and innocence are the missing sparks to reignite the flame of joy.<br>
<br>
But this old order is under threat<br>
What seems changelessness is always illusory<br>
Innocence is a power not acted upon<br>
Its enactment is through chastity<br>
<br>
There are three stages, first<br>
Sthita pragya, a realized soul<br>
Detached, beyond ego and conditioning<br>
Beyond jealousies and grievances.<br>
<br>
Second, work, without regards for the fruits of it<br>
"Pushpam phalam toyum.‚Äù Flowers, fruit and water.<br>
Whatever you offer Me, I will take it." The state of ananya bhakti<br>
<br>
Third: we the Virata,<br>
As Christ said, 'When you enter into the Kingdom of God you have to be like children.'<br>
Chaste, Innocent like children.<br>
Chaste, Innocent like children.<br>
