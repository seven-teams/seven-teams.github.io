<p>
If you can start the day without caffeine,<br>
If you can get going without pep pills,<br>
If you can always be cheerful, ignoring aches and pains,<br>
If you can resist complaining and boring people with your troubles,<br>
If you can eat the same food every day and be grateful for it,<br>
If you can understand when your loved ones are too busy to give you any time,<br>
If you can take criticism and blame without resentment<br>
If you can ignore a friend’s limited education and never correct him,<br>
If you can resist treating a rich friend better than a poor friend,<br>
If you can conquer tension without medical help, If you can relax without liquor,<br>
If you can sleep without the aid of drugs, ...Then you are probably the Family Dog!<br>
[or a Sahaja Yogi who had a good meditation this morning!! – Editor]<br>
