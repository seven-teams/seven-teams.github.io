<p>
It can hardly be said that we knew Her<br>
although sometimes we breathed the same air,<br>
Or we stood in a similar landscape,<br>
Or we seemed to be speaking with Her.<br>
<br>
But always She knew us: since we were amoeba<br>
And followed our journey with loving attention<br>
All our lives on this Earth, from amoeba to now<br>
Our great Mother was seeking for us<br>
<br>
And has loved us forever since that is Her nature. While we<br>
Have been startled to find that She knew us:<br>
We who were distracted with longing inside us, confused,<br>
Not quite present, unable to settle,<br>
<br>
Or even to value this beautiful Earth.<br>
How She laughed, when She told us how much<br>
We resembled the musk deer, which runs about<br>
Franticly seeking the source of its perfume.<br>
<br>
She found us and settled us, pulling us upright.<br>
She soothed us and cleansed us and gave us new language.<br>
She has brought us to God (while She taught us that love<br>
Is the nature of everything) - making us heirs to His kingdom on Earth.<br>
