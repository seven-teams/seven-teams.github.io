<p>
I waded through fire and brimstone<br>
to get to my Mother Divine.<br>
I went through the hell of a seeker<br>
and found that the fault was all mine:<br>
<br>
I'd created the mess that I stood in<br>
and fell in and drowned in so long;<br>
I'd muddied the life that She gave me<br>
- it was I who had been in the wrong.<br>
<br>
And when I could see what the mess was<br>
- how I'd covered the light that was mine,<br>
I wanted to die like a demon<br>
- I was doomed to the end of all time.<br>
<br>
But my Mother said "Don't be a doubter,<br>
You CAN get to me through the mire,<br>
for you are My child, a part of pure Me<br>
- I forged you in My Divine fire.<br>
<br>
"I love you forever, dear child,<br>
it's your ego that covers your eyes<br>
and keeps you apart from My bosom<br>
- the Spirit in you never dies.<br>
<br>
"Your ego made fire and brimstone<br>
and there will your ego reside,<br>
but your Spirit is part of My Body<br>
- you're with Me on this heavenly ride.<br>
<br>
"So give me your ego, My darling,<br>
I'll fling it into its own hell.<br>
The real you is part of My Body<br>
and within Me you always will dwell."<br>
<br>
I gave Her my ego, so black and so dark<br>
- the one thing She asked, I gave up.<br>
And now I live on in Her heavenly home<br>
and drink nectar from Her Divine Cup.<br>
<br>
For She always was there, and She always could see<br>
- it was I who was blind from the start:<br>
I was born from the love between Her and Her Lord<br>
- all the time I was safe in Her Heart.<br>
</p>
