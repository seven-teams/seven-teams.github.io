It all happened because of the extra letter. What letter you might ask? And rightly so! But that is what I'm about to explain.<br>
L.W.Pilkington, that well known firm of printers, had run off one hundred and twenty one thousand Christmas cards, as was their habit in late October of each year.<br>
The trouble was that this year, one of those infuriating errors of the sort that plagues the printing industry, had cropped up.<br>
To their horror, as they completed the last run of this years four colour Yuletide spectacular, some one spotted the mistake.....<br>
The word Christmas had somehow collected an extra letter and had come out as Christlmas!<br>
Well, as you can imagine, there was consternation all round. Who type set the card? Who proofed the card? Who authorised the printing - and so it went on - an exercise in 'buck passing' and 'duck shoving' that would have made the proponents of the domino theory beam with pleasure at the predictability of it all.<br>
Then Herbert Bonfleur, the studious member of the board, announced that it was not in fact a mistake and that his studies on the subject had shown that in the 15th century, it had indeed been called Christlmass.<br>
The confusion this piece of information caused can well be imagined! A full board meting was called for the following Friday and all those who could be held responsible for the alleged error, waited with baited breath and the situations vacant portion of the newspaper in their hip pockets.<br> 
The meeting started at 11 AM: at a PM, they had lunch sent in. At 2 PM, they called for all the references quoted by Herbert Bonfleur. At 3 PM, there was a phone call from the bishop and at 3.15 PM a phone call from the bank. But still the dark cloud of indecision floated over Pilkingtons like a thunder storm on a hot summer afternoon.<br>
At 6 PM the board made up its mind. It was not a long and carefully worded decision. It was not one of those masterpieces of blame apportioning and retributive statements that boards are so fond of and so good at! No! It was one word.<br>
It simply said "Noelle."
