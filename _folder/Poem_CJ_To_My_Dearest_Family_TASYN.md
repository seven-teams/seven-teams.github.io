<p>
How long we have spent together in such wondrous joy,<br>
How much we have grown as one,<br>
How nice it is to see from where we’ve begun to what we’ve become,<br>
Brothers, sisters, aunties, uncles,<br>
With all my heart I love you all!<br>
Your sweetness, your kindness, your collectivity,<br>
Your laughter, your fun and endless creativity.<br>
Your guidance and good words,<br>
Your mountain of strength!<br>
With all your love and support.<br>
Your talents and qualities.<br>
And your unique personalities<br>
No matter what age or race.<br>
A joyful expression on your face.<br>
Thank you dear family, thank you, thank you.<br>
Your beautiful souls radiating light.<br>
Living and growing in a Sahaj life.<br>
Spiritually connected through God’s divine love,<br>
Heaven has truly descended from above.<br>
One being, one family, one world, one love,<br>
One vision, one goal, one God in us all.<br>
My heart, you see, is overjoyed<br>
To feel this heavenly bond of love in us all.<br>
</p>
