<p>
Kingdoms have come and gone.<br>
&emsp;Their testaments are the wind blown dust;<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Their powerful roots lay crumbled and buried for all time.<br>
Only Thou canst recall the ebb and flow of the ages<br>
&emsp;And, to fruit, all the heartfelt strivings of Thy children, bring.<br>
<br>
Fabled Fountain of Youth,<br>
O' Revealer of Truth,<br>
Holy Mother within, please awake<br>
&emsp;And us take<br>
&emsp;&emsp;To Thy heavenly City of Light.<br>
<br>
Mountains of books have been written<br>
&emsp;To play upon our imaginations and carry, to and fro, our desire.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;We have sailed the ships of want in all directions.<br>
Only Thou canst ,our deepest yearnings, quench<br>
&emsp;And, to fruit, all the heartfelt strivings of Thy children, bring.<br>
<br>
Fabled Fountain of Youth,<br>
O' Revealer of Truth,<br>
Holy Mother within, please awake<br>
&emsp;And us take<br>
&emsp;&emsp;To Thy heavenly City of Light.<br>
<br>
We were seekers of Truth<br>
&emsp;Risen up out of animal obscurity<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Guided by Thy reassuring rouch, have we dared to aspire to attain<br>
&emsp;&emsp;evolution's highest treasure.<br>
Only Thou art the comfortingFire in all our darkest nights.<br>
&emsp;Thou bringeth to fruit all the heartfelt strivings of Thy children.<br>
<br>
Fabled Fountain of Youth,<br>
O' Revealer of Truth,<br>
Holy Mother within, please awake<br>
&emsp;And us take<br>
&emsp;&emsp;To Thy heavenly City of Light.<br>
<br>
Chaitanya dances in our midst.<br>
&emsp;Thy Love sparkles in our eye sand laughs in our smiles.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;We are aimless, fulfilled, eternally young!<br>
Only Thou knoweth the undying gratitude in our hearts.<br>
&emsp;Thou hast brought to fruit all the heartfelt strivings of Thy children.<br>
<br>
Fabled Fountain of Youth,<br>
O' Revealer of Truth.<br>
Holy Mother within, please accept<br>
&emsp;Our pure thanks<br>
&emsp;&emsp;At Thy heavenlyLotus Feet.
