<p style="text-align:center;">
Recently I had a realization:<br>
If I know and care about something<br>
then I love it<br>
<br>
Some might say that<br>
if I know and care about something<br>
then I might also hate it<br>
<br>
But I had another realization:<br>
I realized that hate is just the same as love<br>
projected through an ugly screen of thoughts<br>
<br>
I realized that<br>
there are only two solutions<br>
if I think I hate something<br>
<br>
Either I stop caring about it<br>
or I remove the ugly screen of thoughts<br>
<br>
Now my love is much more free<br>
<br>
It cares for beauty<br>
and dissolves its grip from ugliness
</p>
