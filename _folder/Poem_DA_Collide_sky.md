<p>
I was a swell<br>
Then a wave<br>
Yet, I did not realize what I had become<br>
Until I lost my form to the shore<br>
<br>
Like a molecule<br>
In the vastness of space<br>
Like an arbitrary segment of time<br>
I cling to myself, binding together my veracity<br>
<br>
All the while on a crash course<br>
With reality<br>
<br>
The mothers hand stretches forth<br>
From under her cosmic folds<br>
She speaks softly a warning<br>
"Surrender before you collide"<br>
<br>
Her words form partial considerations within me<br>
Like thoughts fastened together haphazardly from<br>
random knowledge<br>
Like pieces of memories<br>
Laid about, for so long, in my well<br>
<br>
Still the mothers voice stays with me<br>
As her hand, all the while, removes pieces of my form<br>
<br>
I desire to become formless<br>
I desire to become one with the emptiness -<br>
So that I will never again be alone<br>
I desire to become one with that creative force<br>
<br>
One once thought, naiÌˆvely, that to become bigger<br>
was the way<br>
To have some part of myself survive the crash<br>
But now I see that, the passage is smaller than the<br>
eye of a needle<br>
Just big enough for my spirit to go through<br>
