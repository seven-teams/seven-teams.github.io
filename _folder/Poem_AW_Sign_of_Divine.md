<br>

<p>
Did you ever observe calm water<br>
in a river?<br>
Smooth, free flowing,<br>
Not a lot going on.<br>
<br>
Then it explodes against a rock.<br>
Instantly there's beauty<br>
Spontaneous, ephemeral<br>
A multiplicity of unpredictable patterns.<br>
<br>
There's a lesson too<br>
The individual droplets rising above the mass<br>
Are, in their momentary view, superior,<br>
surpassing the rest,<br>
It's an illusion<br>
Even if it doesn't seem so to them<br>
For soon, each separate drop becomes the river<br>
once again<br>
As the river overcomes the obstacle, rises above<br> 
it, skirts around it.<br>
<br>
Each trammel encountered on life's journey<br>
Is but temporary, it neither changes us, shapes<br> 
us, nor does it inform nor affect the goal of our<br>
life which is to achieve the state of spirit.<br>
</p>

It was only later I saw the metaphor, the illusion, when the drops flying high might think they're superior."</list-item>
