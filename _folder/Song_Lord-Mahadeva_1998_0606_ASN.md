<br>

<p>
Light dances at the end of my finger tip,<br>
and I look up to see Your eyes,<br>
the reflection of the Universe.<br>
<br>
Turning,<br>
spinning,<br>
l am lost in the Love<br>
Your glance brings...<br>
<br>
Long dark hair<br>
cascades down Your back<br>
like a river at midnight,<br>
You are seated<br>
on the Earth,<br>
smiling as time spins past,<br>
lost in the Moonlight,<br>
the grace of the eternal Shakti.<br>
Shri Shiva Shankar,<br>
Lord Mahadeva,<br>
You are beautiful like the heavens,<br>
like a thousand flaming sunsets...<br>
no words could ever describe<br>
the splendor of Your being.<br>
<br>
I sit at Your feet,<br>
witnessing the Divine play,<br>
the ethereal dance<br>
upon which the cosmos turns,<br>
and I know<br>
You will always be with me,<br>
seated in my heart,<br>
upon Your golden throne.
</p>
