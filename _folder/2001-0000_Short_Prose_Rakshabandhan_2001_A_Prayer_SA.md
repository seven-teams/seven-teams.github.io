<p>
Jai Shri Mataji,<br>
You are the Supreme Mother<br>
And we are your children<br>
So we are your sons and daughters.<br>
We are brothers and sisters,<br>
This is due to your blessings in showers.<br>
<br>
O Mother,<br>
Through the rays of your bewitching smile,<br>
The holy lotus of affection<br>
Blooms in the hearts of brothers and sisters<br>
Through your chants, the melodious music of purity<br>
Fills the hearts of the beloved sisters and brothers<br>
<br>
Through your moonlit glance<br>
The glow of innocence spreads<br>
In the pearly hearts of brothers and sisters.<br>
<br>
Through your golden vase of bliss<br>
Your sons and daughters heartily<br>
Taste the nectar of great affectionate compassion<br>
<br>
Through your resuscitative vibrations,
The sisters and brothers enjoy,<br>
Rapturous throbs in their hearts<br>

Mother, you are Parama-Chaitanya,<br>
you are the Vishnu Maya,<br>
To proclaim Shrikrishna's grand arrival,<br>
You are Shri Krishna,<br>
To protect the anguished Draupadi in her woes.<br>
You are the Mukta to appease your dear elder<br>
brother Gyaneshwara<br>
<br>
O Maha Devi,
You are protection, assurance, help, appeasement<br>
Peace, joy, harmony, compassion, love.<br>
<br>
Please bless us with the fragrance, melody, splendor, elixir and caressing<br>
For your dear children the brothers and sisters<br>
We pray to you from the heart of our hearts.<br>
To let this holy festival of Raksha Bandhana<br>
Help us to get your blessings for ever.<br>
<br>
Ya Devi sarwa bhooteshu Raksha roopena Samsthita<br>
Namastasyai namastasyai, namastasyai namo namah.
