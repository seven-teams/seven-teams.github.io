<p>
Thousands of years gone<br>
My journey is still on<br>
Never took a moment to pause<br>
To reflect the truth within<br>
<br>
May have been an Emperor or a warrior<br>
May have been a merchant or a beggar<br>
May have been a saint or an atheist<br>
May have been a conman or a gentleman<br>
<br>
Numerous friend and families were formed<br>
Shackles of bondage remained strong<br>
Struggle against injustice & tyranny<br>
Has worsen & least gone<br>
<br>
With every day man is becoming obstinate<br>
Blind religion making him ignorant<br>
Kundalini was still a secret science<br>
Nobody knew its real essence<br>
Promised Land was far beyond reach<br>
Fools shed blood to conquer it<br>
<br>
Since 1970, Divine’s grace were special indeed<br>
Holy Ghost came among us<br>
Travelled untiringly to many countries<br>
Unlocked the dormant power to lift soaring<br>
Showering masses with Kundalini awakening<br>
<br>
Now with new reason to live<br>
To carry on the Divine’s will<br>
To pass on the self-realization key<br>
More exuberant than ever before<br>
My journey continues on the new frontier<br>
