<p>
I am in Sahaj Yoga because I am supposed to make Sahaja Yoga grow around the world and change the world into a better place. I have to show the people the right path. I and lots of others were born realised.<br>
I am a Sahaj Yogi because I want to make everyone united, not all separate countries who fight for land and other little things. We won't be told what to do, we will guide ourselves. I feel my parents are doing the right thing and that they want me to lead them and they want me to help the world, and they want to count on me the way I count on them.<br>
The life which we follow now, has depended upon our last lives whatever has happened is only what should have. What bad has happened to us is only telling us where we are catching. If we fall over and break our arm then the break in the arm is indicating that we are either catching on the Vishuddhi or the Nabhi. Everything we do in life is forgiven but judged for when the time comes. Everything was created by choice, but whatever you choose is your own fate. Sometime when you are being bad, you realise what you are doing and you change. Everything is involved from the simplest of the animal kingdom, to the most complex. When humans realised that they were the most evolved race, and had to be more evolved than the rest of the human race, they began to compete in every way. They had decided that people who owned more land, had power and they were called the greatest. They fought wars and this was a total waste of time. All the miracles that happen are to show us the way to believe that Sahaja Yoga is the truth.<br>
I feel Sahj Yoga is the true and right path. With SHRI MATAJI'S grace we have got our self realisation and the power to spread Sahaj Yoga all over the world. By having faith in SHRI MATAJI everything works out and she protects us. When we go into thoughtless awareness, we have no worries and Mother's vibrations flow through us. We learn to love everyone and establish our innocence. We should give others self-realization.
