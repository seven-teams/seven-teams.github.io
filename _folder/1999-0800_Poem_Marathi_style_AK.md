<p>
You created in Your Universe<br>
In Your Image<br>
In Your Spirit<br>
In Your Body<br>
Us Nirmalites.<br>
<br>
Together, they have become the Family of Light<br>
So Joyous<br>
So Peaceful<br>
So Blissful<br>
Spreading the message of Sahaja Yoga to the world.<br>
<br>
And the World watches them<br>
with envy<br>
with amazement<br>
with disbelief<br>
as they accept Sahaja Yoga as a Becoming.<br>
<br>
And when this Family of Light raise their hands<br>
giving Realization<br>
giving Light<br>
giving Vibrations<br>
More Brothers and Sisters join to fulfill Mother's dream.<br>
<br>
And the Mother waits and watches<br>
with Gentleness<br>
with Love<br>
with Compassion<br>
the day her children truly become<br>
The Bringers of the Dawn.
