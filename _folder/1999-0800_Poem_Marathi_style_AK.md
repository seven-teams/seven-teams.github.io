<p>
When I was searching for God<br>
I went to many places looking for him,<br>
But when I got my self-realization,<br>
I don't want to go anywhere<br>
When Shri Mataji is in Sahasrara.<br>
<br>
When I was searching for God<br>
I read many books to find answers to my questions<br>
But when I got my self-realization,<br>
I don't have questions anymore<br>
When Shri Mataji is in Sahasrara.<br>
<br>
When I was searching for God<br>
I wanted to run away from people and hide somewhere alone,<br>
But when I got my self-realization,<br>
I feel that the whole world is my family<br>
When Shri Mataji is in Sahasrara.<br>
</p>

And I got a desire to write something Marathi style, but I don't know Marathi, so I wrote a poem in English in this style."</list-item>
