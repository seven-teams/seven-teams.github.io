<p>
Have you loved your Heart this day?<br>
Held it like a tender Child.<br>
Beheld pure Innocence at play,<br>
Shared Its laughter, bold yet mild?<br>
<br>
Have you turned your eyes within?<br>
Seeing Goodness spread Its wings,<br>
Breathing deep the cool, soft Wind,<br>
Thanking Love for all good things?<br>
<br>
Have you felt Her Lotus Feet<br>
Carress the Child who dwells within,<br>
Bathing It in Amrit sweet,<br>
That flows as joy from Love's Ocean?<br>
<br>
Have you loved your Heart this day?<br>
Have you sung Its Song of Bliss?<br>
<br>
Take this moment now to pray<br>
That we may all now share in This.<br>
</p>
