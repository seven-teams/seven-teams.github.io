<p>
Imagine<br>
If we could have known that in fact Our Father In Heaven<br>
Wears no beard on his lovely sky-blue face.<br>
His eyes are lotus-soft<br>
His glossy dark curls are crowned with a peacock feather<br>
He plays a wooden flute<br>
He is fond of cows - in fact he dances with cow-herders<br>
He wields a discus - which is actually the rings of Saturn<br>
That he loves us as he loves his young calves - imagine - Our Father.</p>
