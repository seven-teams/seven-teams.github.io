Ganapatipule is an interesting place ...<br>
A hive of activity at camp highly contrasts with the serenity and stillness, of the surrounding environment.<br>
When quietness descends on the camp, the continuous lapping of the sea quietly permeates and soothes ... For many people they have once again come home.<br> One feels a quiet joy here; a 'touch' that reaches every crevice. It is a gentle place, not for the complication of words and thought.<br> 
This is a place of creation. It is a paradise; where the hills, the ocean, and the land all speak of stillness ... and connection.<br>
It is the land of Ganesha, where ego and illusion cannot prevail; where music and laughter wash away even the strongest of obstacles.<br> 
As the shell is finally broken, our true essence is revealed. An essence of pure joy, and peace . . The sublime truth of love and collectivity.<br> 
This is the music of the spirit!<br> 
As the ancient song rings; it reaches not the ears, but the heart ... from which the true wisdom speaks:<br>
&emsp;"We are One ... One in Heart, One in Spirit."<br>
Dear Shri Mataji, may we all hear the song; may we see the divine essence within each of us. May our hearts be open to join in the dance; Your dance, the eternal dance of Lord Shiva!<br> 
Jai Shri Mataji <br>
</p>
