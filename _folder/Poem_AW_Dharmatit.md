<p>
Cut me some slack<br>
Yelled the man at the back<br>
I gotta plane to catch<br>
<br>
You ain't going nowhere<br>
Said She who matters<br>
The only place you're heading<br>
dharmatit - beyond such<br>
<br>
You're gonna be a Satguni<br>
Spontaneously virtuous and righteous<br>
Beyond time, and all attachments<br>
Kalatit<br>
<br>
Why did Socrates take the poison?<br>
Why did Christ agree to be crucified?<br>
Satguni knows the answer<br>
Gunatit - beyond emotional, physical and dharma attachments<br>
<br>
enjoy the absolute<br>
<br>
Cadillac CTS V<br>
<br>
<br>
is beyond time - kalatit<br>
