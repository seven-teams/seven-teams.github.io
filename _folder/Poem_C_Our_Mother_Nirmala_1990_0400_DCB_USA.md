<p>
You are always there for us<br>
Our sweetest Mother Nirmala<br>
Protecting us within Your gently flowing saree.<br>
In Your eyes we can catch a glimpse<br>
Of the deepest Love that You have for Your Children<br>
The Eternal Love of Creation:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;A million twinkling stars, gleaming suns,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and sofity glowing moons.<br>
We are Your Nirmalites.<br>
Your love for us is uncompromising and ever-present.<br>
For You are the Mother who was there for Jesus<br>
&emsp;&emsp;when they took Him down from the Cross.<br>
You are the Mother who has given us the Earth<br>
&emsp;&emsp;and the key to the Heavens.<br>
You are the Mother who forgives us when we forget<br>
&emsp;&emsp;all that You have offered us.<br>
You are the Mother who pulls us out of the folds of darkness<br>
&emsp;&emsp;of our own ignorance - again and again.<br>
Oh Mother of Eternal Love and Conqueror of fear,<br>
May we forever break our chains of lethargy, arrogance, and<br>
&emsp;&emsp;insecurity<br>
And give the World the Beauty and Truth of Who You Are<br>
Mother Nirmala<br>
</p>
