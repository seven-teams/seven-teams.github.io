<p>
It's so difficult to see<br>
The cruel ways of World.<br>
The Truth is always Young, but we<br>
Are getting bitter and old.<br>
<br>
We are growing older every day<br>
More serious and sad,<br>
Our paper boat sailed away<br>
And all the joy is dead.<br>
<br>
Come on, lets run across the Time<br>
Like waves that cross the sea.<br>
Else all the mysteries Divine<br>
We'll never ever see.<br>
<br>
The Truth will win! It's always right!<br>
It'll wait, and then one day<br>
With all the Powers at its side<br>
It'll crush the evil ways!<br>
<br>
And all the dreams that shined so far<br>
Will come to Earth that day<br>
And every kid will get a Star,<br>
A merry Star to play!
</p>
