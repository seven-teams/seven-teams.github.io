<br>

<p>
I came to you so grown-up that<br>
I had forgotten purity<br>
You took me in your arms<br>
As your son Ganesha<br>
O Nirmala Mata<br>
Your breath awakened fragrance in me<br>
A sparkle for all to see<br>
<br>
I came to you with aimlessness<br>
Easy prey to negativity<br>
O Bhairavi you gave to me<br>
A sword to face the enemy<br>
<br>
I came to you all dry and barren<br>
The music gone, the dance had ceased<br>
O Saraswati you made for me<br>
A garden full of joy and beauty<br>
<br>
I came to you with nervousness<br>
No comfort left, the peace had vanished<br>
O great Lakshmi you gave to me<br>
Fulfilment of the yearning of years<br>
<br>
I came to you, all knowledge gone<br>
Of great God's love and mercy<br>
O Shiva Shakti you created within me<br>
A mirror to see that All is He<br>
<br>
I came to you with jagged voice<br>
All awkwardness and misery<br>
O Radha, O Krishna your sweet song<br>
Resounds throughout the universe within me<br>
<br>
I came to you with my ego<br>
And quickly learned it was not so<br>
My shifty eyes you soothed<br>
With a glance from yours<br>
O Mary Mata I love you so<br>
<br>
You opened my eyes and made me see<br>
O Sahasrara Swamini<br>
That yours is the Maha family<br>
With you in them and them in me<br>
O Adi Shakti Mataji<br>
I bow to thee<br>
</p>
