<p style="text-align:center;">
I am looking for something,<br>
Something that has a taste,<br>
Something that has a value,<br>
I am looking for something,<br>
Something that is colorful,<br>
Something that is beautiful,<br>
I am looking for something,<br>
Something that gives peace,<br>
Something that gives joy,<br>
I am looking for something,<br>
Something that can be obtained easily,<br>
Something that can be achieved effortlessly,<br>
In the end, I have found what I have been searching for,<br>
It was me, real me, the spirit in me,<br>
I am Shiva, I am Shiva, I am Shiva.<br>
</p>
