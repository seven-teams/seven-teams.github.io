<p>
God dreamed,
And in Her dreams She saw<br>
The Perfect Form<br>
To reveal Her Love:<br>
<br>
In soft<br>
And tender, rosy limbs;<br>
In gentle, curious.<br>
Tickling buds;<br>
<br>
In plump<br>
And soothing curves that glow
With generous, happiest<br>
Harmony;<br>
<br>
With bright<br>
Caressing, sunny eyes,<br>
And ears to hear<br>
What's pure and dear;<br>
<br>
With tiny,<br>
Shiny lips and tongue<br>
Which taste and sing<br>
And breathe sweetness.<br>
<br>
Into<br>
One simplest, gracious Form,<br>
The Best from God<br>
Was humbly born,<br>
<br>
And with<br>
Each murmur, smile and wink,<br>
The Mother's Heart<br>
Did bound and leap!<br>
<br>
With each<br>
Fumbling, curious grasp<br>
The Mother's Voice<br>
Was heard to laugh!<br>
<br>
And when<br>
That Child was sleeping sound,<br>
The Mother's tears<br>
Of joy ran down<br>
<br>
No flower,<br>
No hill, nor moonlit sea<br>
Can match that deep<br>
Serenity;<br>
<br>
Those soft<br>
Eyelids, so calm in sleep,<br>
Do lull to peace<br>
The whole world's grief,<br>
<br>
As, cool<br>
And clear, comes from Above,<br>
That Heartfelt Sigh<br>
Of Mother's Love.<br>
</p>
