<p>
When hate and envy<br>
Burn the mind like fire<br>
And when revenge<br>
Takes over all desires<br>
The persons walks his roads<br>
Blind and deaf.<br>
<br>
Unbearable for soul,<br>
Worse than death<br>
This dream-like life<br>
Is wasted all in vain.<br>
It brings to Spirit<br>
An Eternal pain.<br>
<br>
O, Friend! Awaken!<br>
You have had enough.<br>
Give up your hate<br>
And raise the banner of Love!
</p>
