<p>
You have a sense of ownership<br>
For the children of your sister<br>
Caring guidance and stewardship<br>
Are what you always deliver<br>
<br>
You shine with the inner desire<br>
Of devotion to the Most High<br>
It glows in your eyes' black fire<br>
There is no telling how or why.<br>
<br>
Your singing is echoing<br>
On the slopes of Mount Kailasha<br>
Where you rejoin the pure being<br>
Of the Archangel Bhairawa<br>
<br>
He, with light; you in a laughter,<br>
Defeat the negativity<br>
While our Sangha will forever<br>
Cherish your songs clear and mighty<br>
<br>
Your destiny is now even Prince of poets<br>
and the best friend<br>
We will reach towards heaven<br>
To touch your ever helping hand<br>
<br>
Belos calls us from the ether<br>
To now rise in quiet splendour<br>
At the Feet of Our Shri Mother<br>
Where Lord Shiva grants His favour<br>
<br>
Chandra Mama is the white moon<br>
On the the head of Pashupati<br>
Baba Mama is like a boon<br>
Given to us by the Devi<br>
</p>
