<p>
This is the tale of Herbert Crone,<br>
Whom, I suppose, if he had known<br>
The proper way to handle life,<br>
Would not have been in so much strife.<br>
<br>
He usually started in the left;<br>
A sorry mess, who quite bereft<br>
Of any sort of self esteem,<br>
Was rarely heard and seldom seen.<br>
<br>
He lurked in shadows full of woe;<br>
He never had a place to go.<br>
If anyone should 'match a cold,<br>
T'was usually him and ten days old.<br>
<br>
And then one day a message came,<br>
Addressed to Herbert Crone by name.<br>
It simply said, "the time is right;<br>
It's time for you to see the light".<br>
<br>
Wake up young man and take your cue,<br>
This clammy youth's not really you.<br>
Go out my boy and make your mark.<br>
Do twenty laps around the park.<br>
<br>
Plan a journey; write a book.<br>
learn to paint, to ski, to cook.<br>
Express yourself, be a king;<br>
Don't sit around: do anything.<br>
<br>
And this he did, I'm glad to say,<br>
He changed completely from that days<br>
For now he's full of zest for life,<br>
He's got a job and found a wife.<br>
<br>
His plans a'plenty come and go,<br>
He's always after more to do;<br>
His energy is out of sight:<br>
In fact, you guessed, he's in the right.<br>
<br>
And so we hope another note<br>
Will bring a kind of antidote;<br>
From which some sense will surely enter<br>
And push him back towards the centre.<br>
</p>
