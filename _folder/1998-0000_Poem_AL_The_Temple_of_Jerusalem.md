<p>
It was in times of Solomon<br>
The king of golden land<br>
Who held the truth inside his heart<br>
And love in ruling hand.<br>
Caressed by sun and washed by rain<br>
On map of ancient world<br>
Like diamond shined Jerusalem<br>
In caring hands of God.<br>
<br> 
And Solomon sang Praise to God<br>
Who blessed his Fatherland<br>
Whose gentle Love is such a force<br>
That nothing can withstand<br>
And then he said: - This whole wide world<br>
Just by Your Grace is run,<br>
I want to build a Temple for You,<br>
As beautiful as the sun!";<br>
<br> 
- "Yes, you can build it", answered God -<br>
"But one should know well,<br>
That in the stones I dwell not,<br>
But in the hearts, I dwell<br>
And if you walk the rightful ways<br>
And rule with Truth and Love, -<br>
You are my Temple, Solomon,<br>
And is it not enough?"<br>
<br> 
... But many days had fallen through<br>
Like sand through open hands<br>
And many beautiful temples were built<br>
In our homelands<br>
But what was built for sake of love<br>
That now hate destroys<br>
And people fight for temples and lands<br>
Like children fight for toys!<br>
<br> 
What was in times of Solomon<br>
Has long time come to end<br>
And now Age of Truth is here<br>
And one should understand<br>
Why fight for shrines of older days<br>
The world of Past is dead!<br>
Itâ€™s time to build the Temple of God<br>
Within our hearts instead!
