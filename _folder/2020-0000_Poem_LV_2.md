<br>

<p>
At this time of hiatus<br>
We are given pause to reflect.<br>
See how the Earth has rolled sideways over the past six months<br>
Now the Sun rises in the North East, setting in the North West.<br>
A slight wind from the desert has painted the deep ultramarine sky<br>
with faint brush strokes of silver.<br>
We lift our heads and thank God for this time of pause.<br>
<br>
The birds sense a new ownership of space and we<br>
give thanks for the miracle of Your Advent, O Mother of all.<br>
Now free from old teachings<br>
which made us believe we were separate selves<br>
fearing God, measuring time with linear minds while<br>
we doubted our inheritance of Wholeness when we were made to feel<br>
like aliens on this Holy Mother Earth.<br>
</p>
