<p>
A day will come<br>
When Sahaja Yog will be by the way<br>
<br>
A day will come<br>
When Sahaja Yog center will be just a social getaway<br>
<br>
A day will come<br>
When yogis will follow fashion & lose vibration<br>
<br>
A day will come<br>
When personal priority will surpass sahaj duty<br>
<br>
A day will come<br>
When the yogi’s mind will rule their heart<br>
<br>
A day will come<br>
When politics & family ties will seal the collective fate<br>
<br>
A day will come<br>
When giving realization won’t be on the yogi’s do-list<br>
<br>
A day will come<br>
When yogis will go astray & lose fear for almighty<br>
<br>
But behold thy little human mind<br>
In this time of last judgment<br>
Many yogis have witness this day<br>
Where collective fear to be blown away<br>
<br>
As the great churning is on the way<br>
Where half-hearted will vanish<br>
And only lion-hearted will flourish<br>
<br>
So alert your tricky mind<br>
We still have little time to amend<br>
<br>
Adi Shakti came all the way from heaven<br>
Sahaja Yoga is her final creation<br>
Divine’s work is eternal forever<br>
It is our existence, now or never<br>
<br>
And a day will come<br>
When all the mother’s warrior will be in heaven<br>
