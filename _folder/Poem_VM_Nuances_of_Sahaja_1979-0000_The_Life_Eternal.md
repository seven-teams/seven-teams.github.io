<p>
Sahaja is a raft on which I rove life's ocean<br>
So sturdy is it I have no fear! It can stand the beating<br>
Billowing fury of the waves—it holds firm whatever the motion<br>
Sliding over calm or stormy weather without peeving!<br>
<br>
Sahaja is a weapon my MOTHER gave me<br>
With it I go armed, lest there be need<br>
But by her grace, no weapon need we<br>
For SHE clears our paths scattered with thorns and weed!
<br>
Sahaja is a spotless stead with my MOTHER astride it<br>
Riding in all her glory—dazzling and victorious<br>
HER hand in benediction raised, her face brightly lit<br>
In humble homage we bow to the MOTHER—so great and glorious<br>
</p>
