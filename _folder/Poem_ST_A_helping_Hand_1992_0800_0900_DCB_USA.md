<p>
Shri Mother says we must<br>
unto ourselves become<br>
the guru of our souls.<br>
We must without restraints<br>
of other people's views,<br>
take hold and reign supreme<br>
over our lives and goals.<br>
How lonely is the way of<br>
Guruship. How solitary<br>
the upward path that leads<br>
to our ascending. And yet in<br>
all Her ways, Shri Mother has<br>
compassion full enough to fill<br>
the world: a love that is unending!<br>
And so She gives us special help<br>
upon the way; those other souls, who<br>
reaching out, can lead us over stumbling block<br>
and chasm dark: when spirits flag and<br>
enerry subsides, leaving us prey<br>
to fear and doubt. Then do they stretch the<br>
helping hand and bring us safely to<br>
our Mother's Ark... with little said,<br>
perhaps with but a smile. And yet it is enough<br>
to steady the conditioning of years:<br>
to kindle up the fires of pilgrimage<br>
and spur us on for yet another mile.<br>
<br>
So many lives have brought us to<br>
this point in time: we stand upon the<br>
threshold of materiality: we needs must<br>
climb the last remaining steps and<br>
cross into Her all embracing world -<br>
the world of God's reality.<br>
<br>
And so we need these helpers<br>
as we grow. We need in turn<br>
to act for others as they do for us.<br>
To reenact the golden rule, so dear<br>
to Mary's Son so long ago<br>
and turn our negatives to plus.<br>
For only then do we fulfil our<br>
Mother's dream of men and women<br>
of the world, who look upon each other<br>
with a sibling's innocence serene.<br>
'Tis thus we tie a rakhi, like a life line<br>
on a mountaineer - to signify our<br>
willingness to guide and cherish them,<br>
no matter they be far or near.<br>
And as we lay aside our life's demands,<br>
to go with them that extra mile;<br>
that warmth we feel - that inner glow<br>
is caused by Shri Ganesha's smile.<br>
</p>
