<p>
On a summer day, Is the time to see<br>
The wind frolic with the branches of a mighty tree<br>
Loftily it stands, idle<br>
Like an instrument to be played<br>
Until an industrious wind sets into motion,<br>
a sway<br>
With a rustle and a whirl<br>
A prosodic rhythm begets the mood<br>
Venting gleams of sun light, dancing amidst the shadows<br>
Leaves tussle, the music begins, A choir of sounds<br>
With a murmur of the windâ€™s roar<br>
No mistaking now, where in the middle of the score<br>
I get lost, on my summer day<br>
sensing the girth of our beings, finding my pace<br>
In these times I see no need to dream<br>
to envision myself at a stream<br>
to escape the drudgeries of life<br>
to have a shelter from strife<br>
I savor these moments, On a summer day<br>
Pleasantly warmed, by the suns' rays<br>
