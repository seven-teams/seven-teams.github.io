<p>
In this year we pray anew<br>
That all Your children come to You<br>
May old and young learn to Be<br>
One with Goddess Mataji<br>
May each morning's light be shed<br>
on Flowered altars freshly spread<br>
<br>
America! Awaken now!<br>
Unfetter your welded brow!<br>
<br>
0h sweet Krishna, Lord Divine<br>
In my Mother I've seen You shine<br>
May I pray to You in Her<br>
Lord and Mother, our hearts stir<br>
<br>
For the yogis who feel Your Mind:<br>
Let our closeness further bind<br>
Grant us Oneness of desires<br>
and the Innocence that requires<br>
<br>
Give us strength to speak Your word<br>
Let us guide all those who've heard<br>
Help us better ourselves for Thee<br>
Help us clear that we may Be<br>
<br>
For this lard of wealth and night:<br>
Grant lost children divine sight<br>
Let not Satan pull down another<br>
Keep safe each sister and misguided brother<br>
<br>
We praise Thee Lord again and again<br>
Thou that patiently blows chaff from grain<br>
May thy nighty discus fly<br>
and Thy wondrous form fill the sky!<br>
<br>
May this year bring to all<br>
Wisdom and patience tall<br>
Fill every farm, town and city<br>
With mercy, mildness and rightful pity<br>
<br>
And thus may every breast beat sing<br>
Of divinity's covering wing<br>
That all my know and ignorance cease --<br>
And Your precious lard bloom Truth and Peace
</p>
