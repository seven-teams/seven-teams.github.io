<p>
Seeker seeker where are you?<br>
Mother Kundalini is waiting for you.<br>
Desire to be one with the higher power<br>
Open your eyes to find the Sahaja Yoga Flyer<br>
Dial in the number or attend the local meeting<br>
Where all Sahaja Yogis are eagerly waiting<br>
Cool vibes are at your fingers tip<br>
But It's your desire to reach the peak<br>
Self-Realization is the universal key<br>
Thanks to Shri Mataji for blessing you and me<br>
</p>

<br>
1- United State secret service<br>
2- ATF (alcohol tobacco and firearms)<br>
3- Department of Homeland Security<br>
<br>
On my way back home, went to a Kayak store, while leaving gave realization to these 2 American seekers Rich and Joye. Heart was filled with joy.<br>
So as I was driving home, this poetry dawn on me.<br>
Dedicated to all my Sahajayogi family world wide."</list-item>
