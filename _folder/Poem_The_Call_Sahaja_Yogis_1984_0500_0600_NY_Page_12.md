<p>
The call Sahaja Yogis, wherever you may be,<br>
Is now its time for us all, to work collectively,<br>
The Yoga that our Mother brings, spreads spontaneously,<br>
Still many seekers lost there are, who seek our Mataji.<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;They're lost on many pathways, yet they so want to grow,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Some are caught up in the past, or their emotions<br> slow,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Still others are futuring, are lost in thought, and so,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;They haven't found the here and now, Sahaja they do not know.<br>
<br>
We know Shri Kalki on His steed, is riding soon this way,<br>
And whilst for us this news is good, some others fear the day,<br>
But still they're pitched in battle. they lead seekers astray,<br>
Yet they must pay their karmic debt, for He will come what may.<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Meanwhile, the time is pressing, let's al join in the fight,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Deviis now with us, so, let's al push back the night,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Of Kali Yuga, the false gurus, and everything not right,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Let's spread Sahaja Yoga and enlighten with Her light.<br>
