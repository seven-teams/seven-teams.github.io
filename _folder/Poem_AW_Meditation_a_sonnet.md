<p>
Webster’s says it’s close or continued thought.<br>
What if it’s the opposite? - thoughtless awareness.<br>
Either/or never had or has appeal.<br>
Both/and did and does<br>
Ananya bhakti - when there is not the other<br>
You’re American, I’m Irish and American<br>
You’re Zoroastrian, Jew, Jain, Hindu,<br>
Christian, Muslim, Sufi, Sikh<br>
I’m a Sahaj yogi<br>
We’re both these and children of the same Mother.<br>
Mother Earth, this big ball hurtling through space.<br>
Sat chit ananda. Truth, consciousness, bliss.<br>
In thoughtless awareness, a dynamic living force,<br>
We become the oneness of Spirit.<br>
