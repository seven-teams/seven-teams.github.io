<br>

<p>
Like puppets on a worldly stage<br>
the leaders plot and scheme.<br>
Some fuel the fires of hatred,<br>
others seek a utopian dream.<br>
<br>
In the streets the masses march,<br>
befooled by illusion and spin.<br>
It is in deeper realms of reality<br>
where Divine Truth battles earthly sin.<br>
<br>
Those who by way of true Yoga<br>
connect with the powers of light<br>
to help raise the human awareness<br>
so it sees what is wrong and right.<br>
<br>
So few, but so great, this earthly clan<br>
who must carry this message around.<br>
When the Devi has summoned these powers<br>
we will truly see peace abound.<br>
</p>
