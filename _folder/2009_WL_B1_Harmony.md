<p style="text-align:center;">
If only<br>
innocence rules inside<br>
There is no need for forgiveness<br>
No knowledge of harm disturbs the peace Only the purest knowledge of love sings within<br>
<br>
If there is<br>
silent knowledge<br>
There is no need to forgive<br>
Oneness with the self makes it pure Harmony resonates in every wave of thought<br>
<br>
If there is<br>
knowledge of harm<br>
Forgiveness leads the way<br>
Innocence can show the path to love Harmony is permeating every wave of thought The Mother heals with a loving touch of subtle breeze
