<p>
O Queen of the Universe<br>
O Devi Adi Shakti.<br>
We were blessed to be Seekers<br>
Many many Yugas ago.<br>
We are blessed with this life today,<br>
Having You amongst us.<br>
May Lord Garuda,<br>
In all His splendor<br>
Carry You swiftly, O Supreme Guru,<br>
To the Holy Land of Berkeley.<br>
The land that has trees,<br>
That will bow at Your aery glance<br>
The land that has flowers,<br>
That will bloom at Your very Smile.<br>
The Land that awaits You<br>
With the Nirmal Desire,<br>
To receive Your Divine Bliss and Grace!<br>
O Devi Mahakali,<br>
O Jewel of the Universe.<br>
O Mother, Our Savior,<br>
Please hear our call.<br>
From the Gate that is golden<br>
To Redwoods so tall,<br>
We await Your arrival<br>
With joy<br>
and love for all.
</p>
