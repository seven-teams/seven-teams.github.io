<p style="text-align:center;">
The Goddess wields a sword in Her hand<br>
The Mother built us Shri Ganeshas in the sand<br>
The Goddess can kill with just one look<br>
The Mother in Her kitchen taught us to cook<br>
The Goddessâ€™s teeth are stained blood red<br>
But the Mother protects Her children instead<br> 
<br>
With a fearsome love, She watches all our stories unfold<br>
Leading us onwards, shielding us from any harm<br>
All the while balancing the entire universe in the palm of Her hand.<br>
Her incandescent beauty puts even the stars to shame<br>
And only with Her blessings can we look upon it<br>
For without, our mortal eyes would be incapable of beholding such magnificence.<br>
Every step we take is only because She allows it,<br>
Bearing our foolhardy mistakes with patience and serenity.<br>

 
<br>
How incalculably fortunate we were to live<br>
At a time when She deigned to take on Her Divine task<br>
For our benevolence<br>
For it is of no consequence to Her;<br>
We are merely actors on a universal stage<br>
Fulfilling a pre-destined role,<br>
Our past actions and deeds enabling us to play these parts. 
<br>
We are blessed beyond words<br>
