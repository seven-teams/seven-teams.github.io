<p>
Long, long ago when the world was just new,<br>
Before there were coconuts, salt, or bamboo,<br>
Before there were colours, feelings, or songs,<br>
There was One so wonderful, loving, and strong.<br>
<br>
And this One went dancing to work and to play,<br>
Out to make oceans and night-time and day,<br>
Out to make mountains and valleys and fun,<br>
Out in the world where all life had begun.<br>
<br>
And every small thing that He touched grew a heart<br>
And smiled in great joy at His beautiful art.<br>
A breath from Him filled endless fields with flowers,<br>
And the gods praised His incredible powers.<br>
<br>
In all of His beloved world He had<br>
His favourite place where He felt the most glad,<br>
And after His work and His play He would go<br>
Up to the lovely, pure Himalaya snow.<br>
<br>
And even today Lord Ganesha you'll find,<br>
There with His Mother and Father divine,<br>
Dancing His dance in the Chaitanya cool,<br>
Up near the sweet Talnoo Sahaja School.<br>
</p>
