<br>  
Wishing everyone a very joyous Sahasrara Day! This day being one of the three most important days, is celebrated with great festivity, music and dance.<br>
<br>
To us it is a particularly significant day, as all chakras find their collective manifestation at the Sahasrara. We are no longer Americans now, but Sahaj Yogis.<br>
<br>
Time has become of the essence as we all eagerly await Shri Mataji's visit to the U.S. After three years we are finally going to have public programs again, and all our efforts must together be bonded by a strong collective desire for their succеss.<br>
<br>
The strength of our pure desire is indeed strong (Shuddha Ichcha Shakti). Supported by our positive efforts, its collective manifestation can be very powerful. At a time like this, national integration must be emphasized. We must all keep in close touch and together work towards this collective goal. Dwelling at the personal level limits us; collectively we work towards a larger purpose.<br>
<br>
Forget about your personal problems. Forget about your hang ups. Forget all your financial troubles and be ready to take up arms. Compassion and love are weapons. Forgiveness is our strength. Together we fight for freedom.br>
<br>
Thank HER for this one more chance.<br>

<br>
Jai Shri Mataji! With much love.<br>
