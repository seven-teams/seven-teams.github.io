<p>
A battle of supremacy between the sun and moon,<br>
The horizon  explodes.<br>
A pulsating fan of orange white and indigo,<br>
Blue Heaven speaks, saying<br>
Simplicity, Humility<br>
Are the key to the power of my Kundalini.<br> 
<br>
Oh Cool, Cool Moon,<br>
Oh life giving Sun.<br>
Nature's perfect children<br>
Give me what I need.<br>
Have no mercy on me,<br>
Enter my heart<br>
And awaken in me my Kundalini.<br>
<br>
Blissfully the Moon hides behind liquid clouds,<br>
Its temperate face I barely see.<br>
Transparent dusk moon teach me tranquillity,<br>
Vibrant Sun teach me to live.<br>
Lord show me thy cool breeze, simple and complete<br>
Let me understand the power of my Kundalini.<br>
</p>

The sunsets were spectacular. One evening as the sun was setting, the moon was rising and the sky was laden with these two opposing forces. It was such a powerful sight that I wrote a song in which I tried to capture my experience and feelings as I stood foot soaking in the ocean, here are the words: [see above]."</list-item>
