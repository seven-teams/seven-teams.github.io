<p>
Shri Mother, you are my Shepherd,<br> 
shall not want...<br>
You are so solicitous of my well being.<br>
You quieten my thoughts until they are like still waters.<br>
You have come to restore my soul.<br>
It is you who shows me the path of righteousness<br>
That I must travel, for Your name's sake.<br>
<br>
I know that even though I walk through<br>
The valley of the Shadow of Death<br>
I should fear no evil.<br>
For You are with me.<br>
Your vibrations and my kundalini<br>
Are there to comfort me.<br>
<br>
You make it known to my enemies that I am one of Your children.<br>
You anoint my head with the grace of God,<br>
And chaitanya flows upon me.<br>
Surely goodness and mercy<br>
Shall follow me all the days of my life;<br>
And I shall dwell in the glow<br>
Of Your heart forever.
</p>
