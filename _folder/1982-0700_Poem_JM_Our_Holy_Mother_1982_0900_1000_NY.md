<p>
Our Holy Mother,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Who resides everywhere,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Holy is your name.<br>
<br>
Truly you are Nirmala,<br> 
&emsp;&emsp;And the three worlds,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Sing your fame.<br>
<br>
You are Mahashakti,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;You are Kalki,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Yours is the last judgement.<br>
<br>
You are the Creater [Creator],<br>
&emsp;&emsp;You are the Preserver,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To destroy the evil you came.<br>
<br>
You are the teacher,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;You are the knowledge,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You are the literature,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To understand the knowledge<br>
<br>
You are the poetry,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;You are the literature,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You are the speech,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And you are the silence.<br>
<br>
You are the Sun,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;You are the Moon,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You are the Star,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;That shines in the doom.<br>
<br>
You are the living,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;You are the life,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And you are the Earth,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;That bears life.<br>
<br>
You are joy,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;And you are Happiness,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And one who prays to you,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Gets Eternal Happiness.<br>
<br>
The Mother of Lord Ganesha,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Kartike and Jesus are You,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;O' Mother accept us sahaja yogis,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As your children too.<br>
