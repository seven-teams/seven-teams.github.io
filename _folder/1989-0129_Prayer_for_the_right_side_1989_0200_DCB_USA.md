You defeated the gandharvas to display your impatience with frivolity.<br>
<br>
Please ...<br>
<br>
You set Lanka on fire to curb the pride of the arrogant.<br>
<br>
Please ...<br>
<br>
You are the perfect Archetype of complete angelic obedience, and total efficiency.<br>
<br>
Please ...<br>
<br>
Your action is nothing but a thought of Shri Adi Shakti.<br>

Your action is to make the vision of Shri Adi Shakti come true.<br>
<br>
Please ...<br>
<br>
Shri Mataji, Thou art sakshat Shri Adi Shakti.<br>
Thy vision is of the brotherhood of man in the unity of the Spirit.<br>
Thy vision is of acting compassions, serene joy and spiritual fulfillment.<br>
<br>
May we, thy children in America, learn to use our right side for the manifestation of thy greatest Glory.<br>
Shri Mataji, we bow to Thee again and again. Amen.
