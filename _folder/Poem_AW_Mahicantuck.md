<br>

<p>
We take nothing with us when we go<br>
Born with clenched fists, we die with open hands<br>
And everything born on this Earth<br>
One day has to die.<br>
<br>
But if you're lucky,<br>
And blessed by the destructive powers of Lord Shiva,<br>
To destroy the negativity around and within you.<br>
You'll be as clean as a whistle or a flute<br>
<br>
If you can't give light<br>
What's the use of enlightenment?<br>
And clear and clean<br>
The music of Lord Krishna plays through you.<br>
<br>
Wisdom is like the Mahicantuck,<br>
As the Lenape called the Hudson river<br>
Is best when it flows two ways.<br>
Is best when it flows two ways.<br>
<br>
The Goddess had us eat from the tree of knowledge,<br>
And it's the knowledge and power of chastity.<br>
That we have to get back to,<br>
To get back to the purity of the garden.<br>
</p>
