<p>
Indians and Pilgrims met for the first Thanksgiving<br>
The Pilgrims thankful for the techniques they learned<br>
The Indians first full of joy believing they can share<br>
<br>
Share their knowledge, share their stories<br>
Share their love for Mother Earth<br>
Who had blessed them plentifully<br>
In response to love<br>
<br>
How could they know that the pilgrims were satisfied<br>
with only the techniques, not able to understand the subtlety?<br>
<br>
Were satisfied to exchange niceties and stories of their heroic journeys<br>
In response to stories of humble truths wrapped in mythology<br>
In response to practices of worship, which to the pilgrims<br>
seemed strange and godless<br>
<br>
How could the Indians know that they would catch sickness and frustration?<br>
That their seeds of knowledge would fall on poisoned ground?<br>
Their innocence was taken for naivety?<br>
<br>
Oh Mother, please forgive us<br>
Pilgrims and immigrants<br>
to this country of Kubera and Virat<br>
Whom you yourself now came to teach<br>
<br>
Please allow us to truly listen to your stories<br>
Let us learn the methods of planting seeds<br>
Let us understand the message of love<br>
And do not let us fall into the trap<br>
of only learning the techniques<br>
<br>
Give us the ability to first please you<br>
By asking the question:<br>
"What would our Mother want us to do?"<br>
