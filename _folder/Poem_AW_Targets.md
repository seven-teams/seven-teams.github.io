<p>
Targets, objectives, goals<br>
Short term, medium term and long term<br> 
A proven means to beat yourself up,<br>
Make yourself miserable<br> 
A great way to avoid living the life you're<br> 
meant to live.<br>
<br>
I'd rather know myself, be, live in the<br> 
present.<br> 
What's the good of all that planning<br> 
When you might walk under a truck<br> 
tomorrow?<br>
<br>
No one who scaled the heights<br> 
Who exceeded their wildest dreams<br> 
Ever had targets, objectives, goals<br> 
All great ways to put the mockers on<br>
being outstanding.<br>
<br>
Integrate the heart with the mind<br> 
Anahat to Agnya<br> 
Spirit to Sahasrara<br> 
Live a life worth living.<br>
<br>
Let karma work for you<br> 
Don't put up roadblocks<br> 
Let your Brahmarandra open<br> 
And connect to Ritambara Pragya.<br>
</p>
