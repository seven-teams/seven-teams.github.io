<p>
Dare we to hope that our precious Mother<br>
Will grace our shores again?<br>
The over-turning of official barriers<br>
Ensures no impediment in the way<br>
Of facilitating Her return to us.<br>
With what joy we contemplate<br>
The opportunity to shower again<br>
Our love and adoration on Her!<br>
What pleasure we have in demonstrating<br>
The depth of our love for Her!<br>
We know in our hearts that She is pleased<br>
With all our efforts thus far.<br>
This provides us with the confidence<br>
To create new and wonderful<br>
Ways to worship Her.<br>
The precious Darshan of our Beloved Mother<br>
Is the impetus for our efforts to please,<br>
To show afresh our devotion and love,<br>
To af firm anew our dedication.<br>
May we ever be in Her attention.<br>
</p>
