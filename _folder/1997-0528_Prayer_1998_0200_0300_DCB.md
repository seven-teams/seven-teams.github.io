We all the Sahaja Yogis of the world seek your divine permission to start a 'Negativity Quit-World' movement to be able to enshrine Your Divine Vision of Global Transformation heralding the 'New Age-Satya Yuga'.<br>
<br>
O! Devi Goddess Almighty please redeem this world from all the negativities, baddhas and bhūts which are engulfing this world and ensnaring the
seekers of truth from getting to reality and having Your ever beautiful, loving, compassionate darśhan, which is the only hope of ultimate peace, joy and fulfilment of our evolution on earth.<br>
<br>
Today we the Sahaja Yogis of the world command in the name of the Divine Mother of the Universe, Saksat Shri Adi Shakti Shri Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi!! to all the negativities, baddhas and bhūts to just quit this world.<br>
<br>
