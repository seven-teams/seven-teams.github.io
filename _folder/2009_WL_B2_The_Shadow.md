<p style="text-align:center;">
A new day is born<br>
as the sun touches the horizon<br>
<br>
It’s a beautiful springtime morning<br>
Starting full of innocence<br>
Full of hope and full of desires<br>
No clouds in sight<br>
<br>
As the sun moves up<br>
Suddenly, without a warning<br>
a formation of clouds moves in<br>
Brought on by a burst of wind<br>
<br>
The wind gets stronger<br>
The clouds start covering the sun<br>
<br>
Within moments, the sunny day turns darker<br>
The wind brings anxiety as it turns into a storm<br>
<br>
The clouds are now covering the sky<br>
The sky turns even darker, as, unseen to the eye,<br>
the shadow of the moon violates the sphere of the sun<br>
<br>
Night falls in, in the middle of the day<br>
There is no rain but the clouds are covering<br>
the doings of the shadow<br>
<br>
The birds and other animals<br>
are anxious and confused<br>
The hopes and desires of the morning<br>
seem completely shuttered<br>
<br>
Though<br>
The shadow cannot violate the sun for long<br>
The sun just keeps moving along its usual path<br>
sending out its rays consistently<br>
<br>
As slowly a little light<br>
starts to brighten up the sky<br>
<br>
Even the clouds<br>
As if realizing the futility of covering the sun<br>
are dispersing quickly<br>
And the storm calms down as swiftly as it came<br>
Giving way to the gentle flow of light<br>
<br>
As the day moves on and the afternoon arrives<br>
nearly all the clouds have disappeared<br>
Hope and desires are alive again<br>
The sun, though briefly covered, never left<br>
Could be smiling, could be saying:<br>
<br>
"I am always here for you"
