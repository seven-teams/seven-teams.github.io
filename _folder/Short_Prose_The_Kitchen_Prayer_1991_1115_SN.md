<br>

<p>
Lord of all pots and pans and things. Since I have no time to be<br>
A saint by doing lovely things or watching late with Thee<br>
Or dreaming in the dawn light or Storming Heaven's gates<br>
make me a saint by getting meals and washing up plates.<br>
<br>
Although I must have Marthas's hands, I have a Mary mind<br>
and when I black the boots and shoes,<br>
Thy sandals Lord I find.<br>
I think of how they trod the earth, what time I scrub the floor.<br>
Accept this meditation Lord,<br>
I haven't time for more.<br>
Warm all the kitchen with Thy love, and light it with Thy peace<br>
Forgive me all my worrying and make my grumbling cease.<br>
Thou who didn't love to give men food in room or by the sea<br>
Accept this service that I do, I do it unto Thee!
</p>
