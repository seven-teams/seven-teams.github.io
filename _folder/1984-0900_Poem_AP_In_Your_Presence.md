<p>
O Sweet Mother, our Creator,<br>
source of all joy and wealth<br>
Dearest Mother of us all<br>
How to say just in word<br>
what we feel in Your Presence?<br>
<br>
How to thank You for Your blessings<br>
What to give You for Your cares,<br>
How to express our grateful love<br>
to the One who is The Love?<br>
<br>
And the wonder at Your sight<br>
All the gentleness of Your touch<br>
All the harmony of Your gestures<br>
And the music of Your voice?<br>
<br>
What to answer to the questions<br>
Of the One who is all Knowledge?<br>
<br>
How to tell the sense of mystery of<br>
Your Being, Divine and Human,<br>
How to go beyond the maya<br>
to where there is only Reality?<br>
<br>
In Your Presence, O Adi Shakti,<br>
There is nothings we can do<br>
Except serving You at our best.<br>
<br>
In Your presence, o Mother Goddess,<br>
We can only be at Your Feet<br>
In full silence and adoration<br>
Of Your True and Hidden Self.
