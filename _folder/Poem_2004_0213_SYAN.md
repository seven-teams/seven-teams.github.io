<br>

<p>
I know not how to invoke Thee<br>
I know not how to worship Thee<br>
I know not how to pray to Thee<br>
Forgive me, Oh Adi Shakti.<br>
<br>
I have no mantras, no kriya, no bhakti<br>
Oh great Goddess, and yet<br>
Whatever my prayers have been to Thee<br>
Please fulfil them, Holy Mother,<br>
through Thy Grace.<br>
<br>
All sins have ceased, my sorrows too<br>
My poverty has disappeared<br>
Since I have received Thy Chaitanya<br>
And have been blessed by Thy radiant appearance.<br>
<br>
I know not how to surrender to Thee<br>
and accept Thy Divine Will.<br>
I surrender to Thee again<br>
Please have mercy upon me:<br>
Save me, Oh Mother<br>
Save me, Oh Mother<br>
Save me, Oh Father.<br>
<br>
I must have committed a thousand sins<br>
in my life from day to day<br>
Please accept me as Thy humble servant<br>
Oh Mother, forgive me!<br>
Oh Mother, forgive me!<br>
Oh Father, forgive me!<br>
</p>
