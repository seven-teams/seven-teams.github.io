<p style="text-align:center;">
Some people think<br>
that chance and chaos<br>
are the enemies of structure and of order<br>
<br>
They are not!
Chance and chaos are the forces<br>
that bring about transitions<br>
They are the agents<br>
of new structures and of higher orders<br>
<br>
Some people think<br>
that chance and chaos<br>
are working against the laws of nature<br>
<br>
How wrong they are!<br>
Chance and chaos<br>
are the basics of the law<br>
The law of constant evolution<br>
The law of constant change<br>
<br>
Until the final stage of peace is reached<br>
when, in billions of years,<br>
the universe,<br>
like a used up body, dissolves into ashes<br>
<br>
The consciousness though<br>
will move on to new beginnings<br>
How, is beyond my scope to say<br>
Let's enjoy it while it lasts
