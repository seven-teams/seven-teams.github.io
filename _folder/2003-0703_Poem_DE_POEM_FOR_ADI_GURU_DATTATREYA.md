<p style="text-align:center;">
As the wisps of smoke gently spiral upwards<br>
To reveal the beauty hidden,<br>
So it is that the veil of illusion<br>
Is lifted<br>
When Your Truth is awakened within.<br>
May the ten great Masters<br>
Created to teach us Your Dharma<br>
Enlighten and enrich us<br>
With this knowledge of righteousness.<br>
May we serve You, Mother<br>
With all the devotion of<br>
A true disciple.<br>
May we please You, Mother<br>
With the offerings of a small child<br>
Who is eager to learn.<br>
May we love You, Mother<br>
With hearts that are filled<br>
With Your Beauty<br>
And with Your Blessings.<br>
May we honour You, Mother<br>
As the teacher<br>
Of the greatest truth of all.<br>
Shri Mataji Nirmala Ma<br>
Tasmai Shri Guruve Namaha<br>
</p>
