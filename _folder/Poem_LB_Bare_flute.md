<br>

<p>
After four years of the illness so dreaded<br>
most hesitate to name it,<br>
to my surprise I find<br>
the darkness only a seeming.<br>
In truth how I feel<br>
is light: burned clean<br>
<br>
Burned clean beyond<br>
the terrible scream<br>
of the melting at the stake<br>
<br>
Burned clear as bone<br>
in the veldt, picked white<br>
by wind and heat<br>
<br>
Burned bare, clear<br>
as a flute of silver<br>
tuned to the breath of God<br>
</p>
