<p>
The world and its wonders<br>
Are here in front of thy very eyes<br>
For you to see as they really are.<br>
Have hope, love and compassion in thy heart<br>
And it will overflow with joy.<br>
Remember not the sorrows<br>
For they are not of the present<br>
Forgive all the errors against thee<br>
As you are forgiven thine<br>
And harbour not anger<br>
Thus will thy being be filled<br>
With peace and contentment<br>
Be gentle and carry sweetness in thy voice<br>
And in thy words for it lights the path around thee.<br>
React not to the harsh and cruel dealings of others<br>
Rather be thou detached<br>
As a witness only<br>
As in a play watching only<br>
So keeping peace in thy heart.<br>
The silence within of calm and bliss is thine<br>
And all is achieved if thy heart and thy attention<br>
Rest within the loving arms of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi<br>
Who waits to lead thee deeper into the ocean of joy<br>
She Whose love for thee is constant and eternal<br>
And surrounds thee wherever thou art.<br>
Surrender anxiety, difficulty and thought to Her<br>
And your heart will become quiet and gentle<br>
Thy mind thoughtless and in deep silence<br>
God's Love surrounds thee everywhere<br>
It is only for thee to become aware<br>
The Cosmos itself - the whole<br>
Is acting, working out<br>
The fulfillment of eternal Love<br>
Thy Holy Mother loves thee dearly<br>
And waits only to take thee<br>
Into the Kingdom of Heaven<br>
Here upon this earth<br>
Where all of beauty and truth<br>
Will be revealed to thee<br>
And thou will begin to understand<br>
The absolute<br>
Thy heart will rise in joy<br>
As thy cup of bliss overflows<br>
As blessings pour down upon thee<br>
With reverence and peace<br>
Adore and meditate upon<br>
Thy Holy Mother<br>
For such is She<br>
DIVINE.<br>
