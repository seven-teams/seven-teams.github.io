<p>
<b>(To Shri Mataji, the Divine Guru)</b><br>
<br>
Through many lives<br>
&emsp;&ensp; whatever the mind embraces<br>
It fades away, it leaves without a trace,<br>
<br>
And we forgot all people, names and places,<br>
And only kept in the heart Thy Holy Face.<br>
We moved away the veil of worldly maya<br>
And Your Darshan we joyfully admire.
</p>
