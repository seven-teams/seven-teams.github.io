<p>
It looms above, so high to me,<br>
in my mere mortal stand<br>
That mountain they do call,<br>
the deadly mount of man.<br>
And although I cannot view the<br>
top, l can see in my mind's eye,<br>
The summit of that lonely peak<br>
Set aloof amidst the clouds.<br>
It would be, as I believe, a<br>
wonderous place to be.<br>
Casting its shadow down upon<br>
the earth, and over the curious<br>
ones who in turn have come to<br>
climb,<br>
MAJESTIC MOUNT EVEREST
