<p>
Su is auspiciousness<br>
Darshan is vision<br>
So the power in the Sudarshan chakra<br>
Is of auspicious vision.<br>
<br>
It's the weapon of Lord Krishna<br>
He comes on the Earth to revive dharma<br>
Dharma doesn't mean corruption,<br>
Doesn't mean honesty and dishonesty,<br>
It means Mooladhara,<br>
The beginning of the end.<br>
<br>
He comes to – “sa sahg sthapana artaya” –<br>
To establish the holy state.<br>
To raise human beings to that level.<br>
This is what He does.<br>
