<br>

<p>
The innocence and freshness of the daisy,<br>
The rich softness of the meadow green,<br>
The dignity and poise of the red rose,<br>
The joyful laughter of the bubbling brook,<br>
The might and motion of the rolling sea,<br>
The strength and push of the coastal wind,<br>
The playful spirit of the dancing breeze,<br>
The youth and stillness of the dawning sun,<br>
The colourful grandeur of a desert sunset,<br>
The depth and silence of an evening sky.<br>
<br>
Every puff of breeze,<br>
Every curled leaf,<br>
The spark of light from a drop of water,<br>
is You reflected.<br>
</p>
