<b>Camphor Treatment</b><br>
In a conversation between Shri Mataji and an Australian yogi, Shri Mataji advised that camphor treatment is good for short term relief of left side problems, but it does not cure them. She said that three-candle treatment however is much more effective in the long term, because it actually works out the problems in the subtle system.<br>
<br>
<b>String-burning Treatment</b><br>
<br>
In the Russian National Seminar held this summer in Zhigulevsky mountains in Togliatti, Russian coordinator conveyed Shri Mataji's recent suggestions about string- burning treatment. Shri Mataji said that string-burning treatment is a very good treatment, because it doesnâ€™t heat up the right side (unlike 3 candle treatment) and it is possible to do string-burning more than once per day, without heating up right side. Shri Mataji said that Russian people have combination of a weak left side and hot liver, that is why string-burning treatment is very good for them. In National seminar they performed collective string-burning treatment (just like we did in our West Coast seminar).<br>
