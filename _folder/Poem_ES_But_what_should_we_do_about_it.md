<br>

<p>
There are two main reasons for the present Chaos,<br>
in which all corruptions are being exposed:<br>
<br>
For all good people to turn to their<br>
Spirit for ultimate fulfillment;<br>
</p>

<br>

<p style="text-align:right;">
And for all yogis and yoginis to develop<br>
their power of Witnessing.<br>
Simple.<br>
<br>
Keep your mind clear and your<br>
heart brimming with love.<br>
</p>
