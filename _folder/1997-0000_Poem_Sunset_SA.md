<br>

<p>
When the sun hides beneath the sea,<br>
His rays of light are hidden from me,<br>
Till tommorow [tomorrow] the sun will sleep,<br>
Beneath the ocean cool and deep.<br>
And when he sleeps, he sleeps for long,<br>
The ocean humming him softly a song,<br>
He dreams nice dreams of the moon and the stars,<br>
And of little men who live on Mars.<br>
Then in the morning he rises high,<br>
To sit on his throne of clouds in the sky,<br>
To lend everyone some light tor a day,<br>
Until again he hides away.
</p>
