<p style="text-align:center;">
With the gentle touch of Your love, like the Spring awakening a sleeping seed,<br>
With the gentle touch of Your love, like Dawn welcoming a new day,<br>
With the gentle touch of Your love, like the wind caressing leaves on a tree<br>
We see, we feel, we breathe a new awareness.<br>
<br>
The very essence of our soul, the very fibre of our being knows You,<br>
Yet knows You not<br>
For You are Maya – the illusion of Mother,<br>
Grandmother and child.<br>
All are one and none are like You, for we are all a part of You,<br>
Yet You are within each one.<br>
<br>
How to make sense of this unfolding play, this drama of life<br>
That moulds and shapes our every turn?<br>
Many have tried to unravel the mystery but, without the spark of ignition,<br>
The enlightenment of being, it is as unfathomable as the Universe itself,<br>
For You are the Universe and all that has ever been<br>
And ever will be.<br>
<br>
With the gentle touch of Your love, like the waves lapping against the shore,<br>
With the gentle touch of Your love, like a blanket of snow that warms the earth,<br>
With the gentle touch of Your love, like a raindrop catching a moonbeam<br>
We are blessed.<br>
<br>
For none before have seen such beauty and known that it is only because<br>
You are here now, in all Your infinite glory,<br>
To share with us the secrets of the reason for our birth,<br>
To guide us on our journey to Your kingdom here on earth,<br>
To forgive us all our failings and to teach us our own worth.<br>
<br>
With the gentle touch of Your love, Mother<br>
We learn, we grow, we love.<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>HAPPY 80th BIRTHDAY</i><br>
<i>MOTHER</i>

  <list-item color="BlanchedAlmond"  width="280"><b>2025-0502 Author's .docx file attached to an email to CCT and 2025-0516 Author's email to CCT:</b> "I was living in Vancouver, Canada between 2002-2003 and wanted to write a poem for Shri Mataji’s Birthday coming up in March 2003. Somehow, every year around that time, I would just have the desire to write something and then I would surrender it, not knowing when the inspiration might come, but always trusting that it would. I was living in the ashram at the time and showed my poem, ‘The Gentle Breeze’ to Richard Payment, who was the editor of the Divine Cool Breeze. He decided to include an excerpt in the next edition of the magazine and I was so happy. [Excerpt on 2003-0100 and 0200 The Divine Cool Breeze (USA), Volume 16, Issue 1, Page 48, link <a href="https://b286c762-1c9b-468d-afbf-9f039b298299.usrfiles.com/ugd/b286c7_8d7950519e574b25b0eb5099b0388472.pdf"><font color="DarkGreen">2003-0100 and 0200 DCB (USA)</font></a>.]<br>
<br>
But it was only recently that I came across this photo shown during a video I was watching... There was Shri Mataji reading that particular edition of Divine Cool Breeze...
Thank You Holy Mother for allowing me to write this poem and to present it to You. ɝ"</list-item>
