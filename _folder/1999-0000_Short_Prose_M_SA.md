<p>
Looking over this Great Sea of clouds sometimes makes the other mountains seem like islands and all the houses and trees marooned and stranded. But then, when there are no clouds I can see all the way down the valley, where the rivers meet and up again. I will never change. I will always be here. The other mountains, the ones with trees, will shed their skins many times. Houses and buildings will be built where the forest has bee[n] cleared and the land levelled. But no one will ever build houses on me. My stone and rock is too hard, and my icy cold and snows will always make me a wilderness to all soft and mortal[.]<br>
