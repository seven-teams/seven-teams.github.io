# JAI SHRI MATAJI<br>
<br>
## EXCESS OF EVERYTHING IS BAD<br>
<br>
Excess of MONEY comes fear<br>
With it we feel sad<br>
So Dear always you remember<br>
On seeing it, don't hrads<br>
Because excess of everything is bad.<br>
<br>
Excess of FREEDOM is always worse<br>
With it we do desirous deeds<br>
So Dear I suggest you truss [trust]<br>
Your mind and always be glad<br>
Because excess of everything is bad.<br>
<br>
Excess of POWER makes us weak<br>
it also makes us proud<br>
Please son't it seek [seek it]<br>
Otherwise no one will seek your need<br>
Because excess of everything is bad.<br>
<br>
If excess of everything is bad<br>
What should we hoard?<br>
Dear, we should have limited MONEY FREEDOM & POWER<br>
That make us sad, proud, and lower<br>
So let's hoard in our fragile hearts<br>
WISDOM, KNOWLEDGE & LOVW<br>
Because these are all above.<br>
<br>
### JAI SHRI MATAJI<br><br>
