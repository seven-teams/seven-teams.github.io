<p style="text-align:center;">
The atmosphere is filled with joy<br>
So much sweetness in the air<br>
<br>
The heart responds in gratitude<br>
It makes me smile<br>
<br>
Lifts me up<br>
On a wave of love<br>
Far beyond the mind<br>
<br>
There our Mother touches me<br>
Smiles on me<br>
Touches you – smiles on you<br>
<br>
How much this love is blessed?<br>
It's not human – it's Divine!
</p>
