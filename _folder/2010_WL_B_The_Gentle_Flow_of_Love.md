<p style="text-align:center;">
My heart reaches out to those who love<br>
And to those who believe they hate<br>
To those who think that they are gay<br>
<br>
And to those who think that they are straight<br>
To white and black, brown, yellow, red<br>
As well as all shades of colors in between<br>
<br>
My love wants to flow with strength<br>
Too often, though, it could be too intense
<br>
So I tone it down, sometimes to a trickle<br>
As not to hurt these beings who I love<br>
<br>
Learning to regulate and calibrate the flow<br>
Learning to wise up and discretely, gently try<br>
With creativity to find a way, to tickle and to guide<br>
<br>
To grow myself by drinking from the source
To love myself, forgive myself and search for joy<br>
</p>
