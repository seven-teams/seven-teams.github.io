<p>
Ours is the Sahaja Dharma<br>
Ours is the Sahaja Karma<br>
We, the protectors of the Sahaja, implore<br>
Talk less and meditate more.<br>
<br>
Let no one stay back<br>
Go not astray, be in a pack<br>
Let us join steps with steps<br>
But meditate more and talk less.<br>
<br>
We visit towns, villages and places<br>
House to house, with cheerful faces<br>
We light every lamp with our flame<br>
Talk less, meditate more, do not blame.<br>
<br>
To us our Mother is very dear<br>
Incarnation in Indian woman, it is clear<br>
Let us dedicate, honor, explore<br>
But talk less and meditate more.
</p>
