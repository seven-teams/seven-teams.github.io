<p>
Where the emerald green lake washes the feet of the Almighty.<br>
Where the Almighty Goddess spreads a cloak of green forests<br>
and blushes in myriads of flowers.<br>
Where enthralled by Her splendour time stands in awe.<br>
Where cool winds of Spirit whisper sweet odes to the Primordial Guru.<br>
Where iron opens its heart to love<br>
The Guru tattwa of the universe opens.<br>
<br>
Here come a thousand pilgrims to anoint the Mother of All Gurus.<br>
O' Devi we offer our gratitude from the inner most core of our hearts -<br>
again and again.<br>
You have opened our hearts<br>
but give us the iron tattwa to strengthen our love.<br>
Bless us with wisdom<br>
But also give us humility to sustain the wisdom.<br>
You have showered upon us Your choicest gifts<br>
but also teach us how to share them.<br>
Please keep us forever like the yonder emerald lake<br>
sparkling blissfully at Your feet.
</p>
