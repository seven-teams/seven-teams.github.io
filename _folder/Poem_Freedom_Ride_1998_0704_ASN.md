<p>
&emsp; Destiny is in Her hands,<br>
&ensp; to surrender is a feeling,<br>
&emsp; &emsp; of love ...<br>
&emsp; &emsp; of faith ...<br>
&ensp;&ensp; that there is God<br>
taking care of everything, everywhere<br>
&emsp; &emsp; there is no compromise<br>
no need to trust anything but your inner voice<br>
&emsp; &emsp; which is Her voice<br>
&emsp;&nbsp; one with you for all time<br>
</p>
