When I look at HER photograph I feel totally relaxed and peaceful. It is very nice to sit and just enjoy the vibrations at times when looking at the photograph I feel as if she is moving her lips and talking to me. Her smiles get bigger and bigger[,] she looks very happy when a good deed is done by somebody, at time when I do some bad thing, her smiles get very small and I feel very sad.<br>
To get SHRI MATAJI'S blessings I want to do something very good and meditate properly. Sometimes I think I should give her the best present. I keep on thinking but I find not a single thing in the world which belongs to me for everything is Hers.<br>
One day I thought over it for 2 hours, and suddenly a miracle took place[:] some sweet voice which only I could hear was coming from a faraway place. It was a whisper "Be a good Sahaj Yogini[,] have full attention in [on] me. That is the only gift you can give", my heart was filed with joy and I promised before Her photograph after bowing to Her Lotus Feet that I will always try to do good things and seek SHRI MATAJI'S Blessings.
