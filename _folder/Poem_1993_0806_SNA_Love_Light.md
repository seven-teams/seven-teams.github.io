<br>

<p>
Shri Mother you are walking with me,<br>
A ribbon of moonlight across the sea,<br>
At the waters edge I'm not alone,<br>
You're springing from my sacrum bone.<br>
<br>
This breeze upon my face is You,<br>
Also the moonlight and the view,<br>
Yes, Mother your attention's shining here,<br>
Your love falls on me, so very clear.<br>
<br>
Everywhere Your love and joy pervades,<br>
Across the sea, the sand and the glades,<br>
Blessing, sustaining the variety of life,<br>
Praise to Lord Shiva and His Wife.<br>
<br>
The All mighty God and His Power,<br>
The dawn, the bright Satyuga hour,<br>
Shining glory, Golden Age complete,<br>
Salutations to your Lotus Feet.<br>
</p>
