<br>

<p>
Always, throughout my years,<br>
I was prepared to spend<br>
long hours looking.<br>
Just looking.<br>
<br>
Stars, raindrop<br>
on a twig,<br>
a spider's web,<br>
stripes on a blade of grass,<br>
the seedhead and the bee.<br>
Mountain, leopard, cloud.<br>
Wind and water. Wheat.<br>
<br>
Who will do things?<br>
How will they get done<br>
if you're a dreamer?<br>
If everyone ...<br>
<br>
So the story ran.<br>
The hours were truant, stolen,<br>
rumoured to be lost.<br>
But still I sought them out,<br>
stubbornly, hungrily.<br>
<br>
Now I know<br>
these were the only hours<br>
that were right.<br>
all bustle, bother, wringing<br>
of hands<br>
has blown out of time.<br>
<br>
And here I am, still<br>
kneeling by a flower,<br>
steeped<br>
in eternity: home.<br>
</p>
