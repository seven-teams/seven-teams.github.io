<p>
How great is your Love, O Mother of all.<br>
You have pulled your children from the myre, Snatched them from the jaws of living death,<br>
You have cleansed them, You have fed them when they were starving<br>
And given them the water of eternal Life. How great is your Love...<br>
<br>
You have elevated your beggar-children, You have clothed them with light<br>
You have brought them into the house of the Father,<br>
And seated them at His table. How great is your Love...<br>
<br>
You have illumined your children's hearts, You have taught them to look upon their<br>
Brothers and sisters with love, You have purified their minds<br>
And dispelled their fears. H o w great is your Love...<br>
<br>
You have joined al your children, As pearls on one thread in the great cosmic dance<br>
And the universe marvels at this sight of sights,<br>
As it is filled with the fragrance of Your lotus-children. How great is your Love...<br>
&emsp;How great is your Love...<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;How great is your Love...<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;O Mother of all.<br>
<br>
Salutations to Thee, O Jagadambe, Thou Protectress of the Universe, Mother of All<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Salutations again and again.<br>
</p>
