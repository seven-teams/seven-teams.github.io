<p>
There is a danger for world peace,<br>
Don't take it at ease,<br>
We Sahajis are out of this calamity,<br>
But our unrealized brothers and sisters,<br>
Are not aware of their misdeeds.<br>
<br>
Don't think it's a game<br>
Killing people, What a shame!<br>
Ah! Their near and dear ones,<br>
Cry for their beloved ones.<br>
<br>
My life is to spread this divine yoga,<br>
And I won't at all be at ease,<br>
Till my mission is accomplished.<br>
</p>
