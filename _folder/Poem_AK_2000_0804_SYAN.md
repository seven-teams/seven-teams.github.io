<p>
Mother of India has come to America<br>
Mother of all the sages and saints has come to America.<br>
The One who has made India Holy has come to America.<br> 
Now America will become Holy too.<br>
Mother of India will give the second birth to America.<br>
<br>
Whenever India was in danger, Mother, You have always incarnated to save it.<br>
It is only by Your efforts India won the struggle for its independence.<br>
Now you will give freedom to America also - the freedom of Spirit<br>
Your will free it up from the occupation of materialism and adharma.<br>
Mother of India will give the second birth to America.<br>
<br>
When Your Lotus Feet touch American land, O Mother,<br>
The land itself starts singing Your praise.<br>
It has been always remembering the melodies that Shri Krishna wrote in Your Praise long time ago,<br>
And now the Orchestra of Nature performs them before You with great joy.<br>
Mother of India will give the second birth to America.<br>

Mother, You brought to America the Power of Love -<br>
The greatest treasure without which all the wealth of this country is worth nothing.<br>
Only Your Motherly Love will redeem this country.<br>
It is only with Your Love the Divine Flute of America will sound,<br>
And spread the message of Sahaja Yoga across the world...<br>
<br>
Mother of India has come to America<br>
Mother of all the sages and saints has come to America.<br>
The One who has made India Holy has come to America.<br>
Now America will become Holy too.<br>
Mother of India will give the second birth to America!<br>
<br>
Mother of India will give the second birth to the whole world.<br>
