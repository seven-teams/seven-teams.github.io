<p>
Sometimes I feel like a total human being<br>
with all its faults<br>
with all its weaknesses<br>
with all its challenges<br>
and with all its longings<br>
but in other times I feel like a human being<br>
with all its perfection<br>
with all its strength<br>
with all its sincerity<br>
and with all its love....<br>
<br>
Please Mother, come into my Illusion<br>
and settle my dreams<br>
so that the reality of Your Love<br>
will fulfill my soul and my heart.<br>
</p>
