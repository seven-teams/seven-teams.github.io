<p style="text-align:center;">
A newborn child<br>
So fragile and so beautiful<br>
So loving and yet so powerful<br>
It can make me move a mountain<br>
to protect and nurture it<br>
<br>
Evolution happens right here in front of me<br>
I can see my better self<br>
I can see the future of humanity<br>
<br>
Love, compassion were just words<br>
Innocence was just a feeling<br>
briefly glimpsed inside of me<br>
Now it’s taken form<br>
Manifested in the child<br>
before my eyes<br>
<br>
How could humanity<br>
ever fight within itself<br>
when such a miracle of life<br>
exists in every culture?<br>
<br>
Let’s move mountains of change<br>
Let’s nurture every fragile peace<br>
to protect the miracle of life<br>
Innocently placed in front of our eyes
