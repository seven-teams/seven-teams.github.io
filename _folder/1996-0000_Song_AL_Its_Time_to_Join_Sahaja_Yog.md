<p>
Oh, did you hear that Song of Joy<br>
That bells of Nature ring?<br>
The time is knocking at your doors<br>
So come and meet the Spring!<br>
It's time to bathe in stream of Truth<br>
To wash all ills away<br>
It’s time to join Sahaja Yog<br>
And find your true way!<br>
<br> 
Just open your windows and doors<br>
To gentle rays of sun<br>
And open your heart to Love of God<br>
And see what should be done.<br>
Enjoy the blessings of Divine<br>
To fill your every day<br>
Once you will join Sahaja Yog<br>
And find your true way!<br>
(And Satya Marg will come to rule
the party of true way!)<br>
</p>
