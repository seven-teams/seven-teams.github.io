<br>

<p>
A tree full of brunches,<br>
Those branches, so strong that<br>
resist avalanches and !he ever so long.<br>
<br>
A tree full of hollows,<br>
A tree full of leaves,<br>
So after rain follows,<br>
A whisper of leaves.<br>
<br>
A tree full of greatness,<br>
Rough and dark skinned,<br>
Yet ever so gentle,<br>
A shelter from the wind.<br>
<br>
A tree full of beauty,<br>
Playing sweet songs on it's life,<br>
tree full of duty,<br>
tree full of life.
</p>
