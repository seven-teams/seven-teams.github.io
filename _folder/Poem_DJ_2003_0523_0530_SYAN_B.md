<p>
Only greatness can come from these days<br>
these days of Glory, Glory of the soul<br>
when, when the soul merges with the almighty<br>
Only greatness, only glory of these days<br>
these days of light<br>
light from within, light from above<br>
pure knowledge, pure in its essence<br>
only love shall flow from the purity of knowledge<br>
knowledge Supreme, supreme bhakti<br>
ananya bhakti, merged with the ultimate<br>
merged with love<br>
The Prophets have said, the Prophets have sung<br>
this movement has only begun<br>
come all, come one<br>
Only greatness can follow<br>
only greatness can follow this love<br>
this love that flows from the supreme<br>
Oh, oh no longer a dream<br>
but, but reality<br>
reality, let us see, let us see<br>
let us be, let us be<br>
in the loving company of the Divine<br>
yes, yes, in this time<br>
The Prophets have said, the Prophets have sung<br>
become one, become one<br>
let us come, let us come<br>
become one, become one.<br>
</p>
