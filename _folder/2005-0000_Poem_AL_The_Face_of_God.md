<p>
<b>To Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi</b><br>
<br>
Through many lives<br>
Whatever the mind embraces<br>
It fades away,<br>
It leaves without a trace.<br>
And we forgot all people,<br>
Names, and places,<br>
And only kept in the heart<br>
Your Holy Face.<br>
<br>
We moved away<br>
The veil of worldly Maya<br>
And Your Darshan<br>
We joyfully admire.
</p>
