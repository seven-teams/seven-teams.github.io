<p>
Mother do you remember?<br>
<br>
Sorry of course you do how much we have<br>
been longing you<br>
<br>
Missing you ten thousand years in the land<br>
of our fears<br>
<br>
From the branches of the past like leaves<br>
we have become dust in the streets of<br>
time and space just for one your sweet<br>
embrace<br>
<br>
And today we have gathered here<br>
to worship you like the wheat<br>
in the season of the harvest<br>
bowing to your lotus feet<br>
<br>
But without your holy grace<br>
how unripe still now we are<br>
like a sea without the water<br>
like the sky without the stars
<br>
like the wind closed in a cage<br>
like a river in a glass<br>
the overflowing of your blessings<br>
all of us still now surpass<br>
<br>
But although we are not ready<br>
and still trapped into the play<br>
we would pray your holy mercy<br>
give us your embrace today<br>
<br>
Let the spirit gently whisper<br>
through our body and our mind<br>
let our ears be not so deaf<br>
and our eyes be not so blind<br>
<br>
Let it fully imbibe our beings like the grass<br>
under the rain<br>
let it melt all our chains<br>
let’s forget pleasure and pain<br>
<br>
Let us be within the eternal<br>
For a moment stop the wheel<br>
Make us clear then a crystal<br>
Make us stronger then the steel<br>
<br>
Take us to the holy land<br>
beyond the moon beyond the sun<br>
where the joy is the only bread<br>
where earth and sky are one<br>
<br>
where the light becomes the ocean<br>
let us all arise above<br>
to understand one time forever<br>
the real meaning of your love<br>
<br>
Of that love that will remain<br>
When all mountains will be sand<br>
in an everlasting present<br>
your pure love will never end<br>
<br>
When the comedy will finish<br>
and no passions will be alive<br>
all the thoughts will disappear<br>
and your love will still survive<br>
<br>
For your love is the only reason<br>
for your love is the only way<br>
for your love is the only answer<br>
let us be that love today<br>
<br>
In this blissful celebration<br>
of your eighty years of life<br>
where you’ve been the best in all<br>
daughter sister mother and wife<br>
<br>
You are for us a great example<br>
With your husband sir C.P.<br>
For the world to realize how<br>
Men and women have got to be<br>
You’re a couple that’s enchanting<br>
Evergreen and eversmart<br>
You make silent every mind<br>
You make joyfull every heart<br>
<br>
And so all we your admirers<br>
one last thing would like to say<br>
Let us celebrate with you<br>
Twenty thousand more this day!
