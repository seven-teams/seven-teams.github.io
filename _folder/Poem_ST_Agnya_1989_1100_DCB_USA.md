<p>
Our Father, which art in heaven,<br>
May Thy Son be the leaven of<br>
Our souls, to make them rise<br>
In glory and aflame.<br>
So truly hallowed be Thy name.<br>
For we, Thy journeying children<br>
Feel as one and long to see<br>
Thy kingdom come.<br>
We know the battle must be fought:<br>
And at what price has Jesus<br>
Bought our freedom to become.<br>
We cannot shirk the task ahead -<br>
We can but say as Jesus said;<br>
"Father, Thy will be done!"<br>
For here on earth with chakras<br>
Seven; so must we be as 'tis in heaven,<br>
And sallying forth - uplifted head,<br>
We care not for our daily bread:<br>
For just as He, a babe, was fed,<br>
So too His Mother fondly said<br>
To all your children here on earth;<br>
Each one that tries to prove his worth;<br>
That long before his battle wins,<br>
Will lovingly forgive our sins;<br>
Provided we likewise repay,<br>
Those who aggress us on the way.<br>
So lead us from temptation's lair<br>
And guide us through that evil snare<br>
Of Satan's make; that is so hard<br>
For us to spy: and once ensnared<br>
To break! Dear Father, all<br>
Is Thine we know; the power & the glory<br>
So - even as the lamb was slain,<br>
We humbly beg to rise again:<br>
To claim our own divinity;<br>
In penitence to journey home;<br>
To glory in Thy kingdom come<br>
And live there till infinity!
</p>
