<p>
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold<br>
And she's buying a stairway to heaven<br>
And when she gets there she knows if the stores are closed<br>
With a word she can get what she came for.<br>
<br>
There's a sign on the wall<br>
But she wants to be sure<br>
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.<br>
<br>
In a tree by the brook there's a songbird<br>
Who sings sometimes<br>
All of our thoughts are misgiven.<br>
<br>
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving.<br>
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees<br>
And the voices of those who stand looking.<br>
<br>
And it's whispered that soon<br>
If we all call the tune<br>
Then the piper will lead us to reason<br>
And a new day will dawn<br>
For those who stand long<br>
And the forests will echo with laughter.<br>
<br>
And it makes me wonder.
<br>
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow<br>
Don't be alarmed now<br>
It's just a spring clean for the May-Queen.<br>
Yes there are two paths you can go by<br>
But in the long run<br>
There's still time to change the road you're on.<br>
<br>
Your head is humming and it won't go<br>
- In case you don't know<br>
The piper's calling you to join him.<br>
Dear lady can you hear the wind blow<br>
And did you know<br>
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.<br>
<br>
And as we wind down the road<br>
Our shadows taller than our soul<br>
There walks a lady we all know<br>
Who shines white light and wants to show<br>
How everything still turns to gold.<br>
And if you listen very hard<br>
The tune will come to you at last<br>
When all are one and one is all<br>
To be a rock and not to roll.<br>
</p>
