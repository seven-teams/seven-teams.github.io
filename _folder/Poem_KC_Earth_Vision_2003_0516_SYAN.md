<p>
After the deaths and destruction of all the evil,<br>
The kundalinis rise all over the world<br>
And through the broken egos of Ã¦ons emerge.<br>
<br>
The myriad single lights spontaneously mingle,<br>
Creating one great blazing light of truth,<br>
And all the people begin to see one another.<br>
<br>
Together they grow in pure love and stature.<br>
The snakes of ignorance held in their hands in the dark<br>
They drop in amazement now they see what they are.<br>
<br>
Where there was horror the Earth swallows it up,<br>
Where there were floods the rains ease and clear,<br>
Where there was drought the rains sweetly fall,<br>
Where tornadoes raged the winds become gentle.<br>
<br>
Rivers go back to where they were before;<br>
The fires cease, soft greenness covers the black.<br>
The people look at each other in light and wonder<br>
As burdens of karmas of millenia now are lifted.<br>
<br>
They see themselves and others in their glory.<br>
Their grief for those who are lost is soon assuaged<br>
With knowledge and understanding of the Whole.<br>
Their sadness dissipates in the joy of the Spirit<br>
And loneliness on Earth has ceased to be.<br>
<br>
The maimed and the crippled are healed and pain is gone.<br>
Shri Kalki, Jesus, has come again to cleanse.<br>
He is the love, forgiveness, resurrection<br>
Of the whole human race reborn in Truth.<br>
He is the Judgement, and judges absolutely.<br>
<br>
The meek in heart, the good, the innocent,<br>
The loving, caring, sensitive and gentle<br>
Inherit the Earth and joyful Earth responds<br>
With total resurrection of Her glory.<br>
<br>
The Garden of Eden returns for all the people<br>
To love, enjoy, rejoice in and return<br>
The love to God with grateful praise and worship.<br>
<br>
You are the Love, Oh Mother, the Truth and the Law;<br>
We thank you Mother, now and evermore.<br>
</p>
