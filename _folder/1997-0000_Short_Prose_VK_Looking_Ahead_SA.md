<p>
During, this year, a new building was under construction, but due to the unfavourable weather conditions, this building could not he completed this year. We are sure that by next year, it will be finished and we will be having a new and bigger meditation hall, at it's first floor, for both seniors and juniors collectively. There will also be three new laboratories for Chemistry, Biology and Physics in the second floor, where we will [be] able to have more and better facilities. In this way, we will be understanding these three subjects in a better way. New residential units will be built in the  third floor for the teachers, which will provide more space for them. The old senior meditation hall will be the library.
