After matriculation he was sent to England to study law. He got his degree there and returned to India. He went to jail number of times but his struggle for justice continued. He was horn at Porbander in Guj[a]rat. He realised that the only way of improving his lot was by freeing them from foreign bondage. His life was simple but his ways were simpler. He wore simple khadi dhoti and told the Indians to burn all the foreign clothes. On 30th of January, 1948, a fanatic shot him dead when he was going to his prayer meeting. Gandliji had two adopted daughters. Truth and non-violence were his chief weapons. He struggled for the independence of his country. People used to cal him "Bapu".
