<p>
Thank you for coming!<br>
Your purpose is clear<br>
Beyond all imagining<br>
That we could be here<br>
<br>
To serve as Your children<br>
To witness, become<br>
A new generation<br>
Of Spirit, of one<br>
<br>
Mother, we cannot<br>
In truth comprehend<br>
The  depth of Your Being,<br>
Your hopes for us all.<br>
<br>
But we as Your children<br>
Who still are so small,<br>
Rejoice in this birthday --<br>
Thank you for coming!
</p>
