<p>
From job to job and from place to place<br>
Something keeps you moving in life,<br>
The life for you is an endless race<br>
And for better always you strive.<br>
<br> 
A beast has a forest, a fish has a sea,<br>
And a bird has the bottomless sky<br>
But what makes you wander? what prompts you to seek<br>
Hidden quest you cannot satisfy?<br>
<br> 
Within you it always was<br>
Bright like the sun<br>
And gentle like the rain<br>
From depth of heart<br>
It sweetly calls:<br>
Chase for the truth<br>
That you can attain!<br>
<br> 
But how to find it? where to start?<br>
The directions are tricky to guess:<br>
The ancient writings have fallen apart<br>
And the paths have been lost in the grass...<br>
<br> 
And leaving at peace all confusion of Past<br>
You are blazing your own trail anew<br>
For there is a guide you rely on and trust<br>
Very loving and loyal to you:<br>
<br> 
Within you it always was<br>
Bright like the sun<br>
And gentle like the rain<br>
From depth of heart<br>
It sweetly calls:<br>
Chase for the truth<br>
That you can attain!<br>
</p>
