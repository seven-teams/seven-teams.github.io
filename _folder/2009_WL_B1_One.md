<p style="text-align:center;">
I am one<br>
<br>
One with myself<br>
One with the child inside of me<br>
One with joy bubbling in my heart<br>
One with the spirit of eternity<br>
I am one<br>
<br>
One with the Mother in my heart<br>
One with the Mother nurturing me from the earth<br>
One with the Mother in the space of the universe<br>
One with the Mother silently protecting me<br>
<br>
I am one<br>
<br>
One with the here and now<br>
</p>
