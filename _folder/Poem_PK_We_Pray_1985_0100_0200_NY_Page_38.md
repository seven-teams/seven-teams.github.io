<p>
"Poetic Genius" did Blake inspire,<br>
A Higher light, the coolest fire.<br>
<br>
Did rend the callous curtain hung.<br>
Ignorance gone ! thy knell is rung-<br>
<br>
So too, sweet luminescent Chime<br>
Speak forth in me the truth though rhyme.<br>
<br>
That that, Etheric translucent thing,<br>
Might take form through pen and bring.<br>
<br>
Her light and love more into play.<br>
And hasten forth that Dawning Day-<br>
<br>
Shri Durga Ma, with Hands untold,<br>
let forth thy drama, now, unfold,<br>
<br>
And whatever help that we might be.<br>
Let us be that, Shri Mataji.<br>
</p>
