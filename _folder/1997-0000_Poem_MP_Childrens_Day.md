<p>
Yesterday was children's day,<br>
And all the day the children played,<br>
We watched television,<br>
And did some revision,<br>
The sun was out,<br>
And everyone was about,<br>
The teachers prepared a hearty party,<br>
While all the children dressed up smartly,<br>
And that's all I have to say,<br>
About 97's children's day.
