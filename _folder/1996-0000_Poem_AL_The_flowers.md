<p>
There are places troubled and poor in the whole world<br>
Where people cry for our help but nobody would like to go<br>
And only suddenly fair like a message of God<br>
Among those poor grounds beautiful flowers grow.<br>
<br> 
Flowers don't know the bad and good<br>
Prestige and comforts they don't know<br>
In every country and every neighbourhood<br>
On stones and on sands the Flowers grow.<br>
<br>
But people like to create and compare brands<br>
And then according to taste they make divisions<br>
And so they turned the earth into separate lands<br>
And so they turned the truth into separate religions<br>
<br>
But Flowers don't know the bad and good,<br>
Prestige and comforts they don't know,<br>
In every country and every neighbourhood<br>
On stones and on sands the Flowers grow.<br>
<br>
And if we go all out and listen to our heart<br>
We'll see that each person around is like our sister or brother<br>
We will feel that the earth is the whole and we're only a part<br>
And so we should not judge, but we should enjoy each other<br>
<br>
For Flowers don't know the bad and good,<br>
Prestige and comforts they don't know,<br>
They grow in every country and every neighbourhood<br>
And lets wish that in our hearts these Flowers grow.<br>
</p>
