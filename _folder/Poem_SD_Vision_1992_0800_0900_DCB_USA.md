<p>
If we really come together, the world will become one,<br>
Dig down deep inside your soul-bring out all your love.<br>
Look around see all the faces the quality on each and every one<br>
Add 'em up, put e'm all together, get a vision as bright as the sun.<br>
<br>
Ever since the world began we've been struggling to evolve.<br>
Al our pains and confrontations She's been able to dissolve.<br>
Look around inside your brother's heart everybody searching to play their part.<br>
Add 'em up anyway you like, anyway you look at it, it's Divine Art.<br>
<br>
Now it's time to open up, open up our hearts<br>
Take up arms and spread on out - show them who we are.<br>
Fearlessly with determination thrust forth the light.<br>
Fight for peace, fight for freedom, insist on, insist on what is right.<br>
<br>
Now it's time to sing it out, one clear message Adi Shakti.<br>
Time to show the world how to live eternally.<br>
Time is short, gotta make the most of this time with the Holy Ghost,<br>
Before the year's out the world's gotta know which direction it wants to go.<br>
<br>
Not it's time to open out, open out our hands,<br>
Spread vibrations everywhere throughout every land.<br>
Everybody in the world rejoice,<br>
Rise together, make the right choice.<br>
Every nation, every country, under God, under the Son,<br>
Rise together in one great voice.
</p>
