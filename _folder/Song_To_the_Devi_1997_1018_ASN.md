<p>
O, Mother! We have come out from the darkness and have entered into enlightened world.<br>
We could get Pure Knowledge from Your divine lap which the mortal world could not give so far.<br>
All the three lokas respect You from heart.<br>
You, the originator of Pure Knowledge, have given us true rebirth.<br>
<br>
O, Mother Goddess, You have taken birth in human form to awaken our Kundalini Shakti.<br>
Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati and Mahakali are only Your powers.<br>
The devotees sing in praise of You.<br>
We have received all bliss from You.<br>
<br>
By taking your incarnation all the human race has been obliged.<br>
Thousands have got Self-realization from Your Lotus Feet.<br>
Wherever you go, the whole nature fills with joy.<br>
<br>
O, Mother! Now take us under your shelter since we have been in the darkness and filth after we had taken birth.<br>
Even your devotees have taken care of those who were not realized.<br>
<br>
O, Mother! We fully surrender to You, please guide us further.<br>
We should do only good deeds,<br>
Speak only truth and remain in thoughtless awareness.<br>
We have come under Your shelter, kindly stabilize our attention on our SahasrƒÅr under Your Lotus Feet.
</p>
