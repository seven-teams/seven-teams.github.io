<br>

<p>
She walks<br>
God-haired, God-fingered<br>
Touching Autumn into Summer<br>
with the silence of her smile.<br>
She sings,<br>
Lark-solemn, high, exultant,<br>
Sweeping snowlight into Spring.<br>
She smiles<br>
Sun-blue, sun-brilliant<br>
In the shelter of the storm.<br>
She speaks cool clear<br>
Soul calming<br>
In the music of the mind.<br>
</p>
