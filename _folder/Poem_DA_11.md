<p align="center">
Pouting flowers humbly hide their beauty, while unable to hide their scent<br>
Golden butterflies find ballast for their wings<br>
And faint sounds of trickling water seek an ear, to spring to life<br>
While a soft morning h u e embraces a cold sky<br>
<br>
Day washes clean, the dark of night<br>
<br>
<br>
The dew of morn has assemble about me<br>
And shimmer as stars do<br>
In the dark of night<br>
Ia m in the center of them wherever I move.<br>
<br>
One, will I be today Whole and complete<br>
In this garden wearing Gardners shoes<br>
I am no less than the husk in the kings shoes<br>
For as I revere him<br>
My flowers are revered by him<br>
</p>
