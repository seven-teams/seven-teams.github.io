<p>
When Mother looked in my eyes.<br>
I suddenly lost the weight of maya.<br>
My body and thought shrivelled<br>
together to futility and nothingness<br>
and my heart was filled with joy.<br>
<br>
&emsp; &emsp;The sparks of Her Spirit ignited<br>
&emsp; &emsp;a mild and cool Kundalini - fire<br>
&emsp; &emsp;that softly and gently remodelled<br>
&emsp; &emsp;my body into a timeless temple<br>
&emsp; &emsp;to be occupied by Mother Adi Shakti.<br>
<br>
A bundle of translucent beams<br>
transformed my thoughts into fountains<br>
of wordless prayers, extending<br>
to the throne of the Golden Goddess,<br>
dressed in Her gorgeous garment of love.<br>
<br>
&emsp; &emsp;A balmy breeze blew through my soul<br>
&emsp; &emsp;and swept the lingering dust of ages,<br>
&emsp; &emsp;erased the stains of earlier lives<br>
&emsp; &emsp;and poured a shower of lasting love<br>
&emsp; &emsp;into the chalice of my eager self.<br>
