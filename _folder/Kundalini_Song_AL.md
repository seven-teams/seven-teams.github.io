<p>
Behold the thread of Life<br>
That guides the boat of soul<br>
Through shallow stream of Time
To Ocean of Joy<br>
The Truth that always wins<br>
The Love that never binds<br>
And gently gives us choice<br>
To grow and enjoy<br>
Our bodies, our minds<br>
Are only shell of Maya<br>
All dreams of mortal world<br>
Will fade away like dust<br>
But what we hold inside<br>
Is our pure desire<br>
The only real wish<br>
To follow and trust -<br>
Oh, Kundalini Ma,<br>
We want to be the flow<br>
Of Your Eternal Bliss,<br>
The living breath of Thine,<br>
From seed to mighty tree<br>
Inside of us You grow<br>
And take the spring of self<br>
To the Ocean of Divine!<br>
<br> 
The ancient face of Time<br>
Is changing its expression<br>
As shadows and light<br>
Create the day and night,<br>
But sacred and untouched<br>
You dwell in each creation<br>
You are the Love of God<br>
Revealed from inside.<br>
We have a rare chance<br>
In dawn of Golden Era<br>
To feel Your rising shine<br>
That shows us the way<br>
So now to save the world<br>
We all must come together<br>
And at Your Lotus Feet<br>
Inside of our hearts we pray -<br>
Oh, Kundalini Ma,<br>
We want to be the flow<br>
Of Your Eternal Bliss,<br>
The living breath of Thine,<br>
From seed to mighty tree<br>
Inside of us You grow<br>
And take the spring of self<br>
To the Ocean of Divine!
