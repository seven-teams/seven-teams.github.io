My name is Ruth Parker and have just moved to Australia. I was looking through one of my old photo albums of the period when I was in India. And it brought back many of my old memories. I remembered our old village, Swamavue and my old roof. To the right was the road that led to the main road. My best friend,  Hailey's house was right next to mine and the school was just up the path. Once Hailey and my family climbed to the top of the tallest mountain, which was covered with snow upto [up to] our knees. We had camped overnight on the way up. When we had got there. We [, we] went sledging and skiing. That was one of the nicest things 1 remember about it. We also used to go down to the river in Summer and had water fights. But in winter, we had to come in because there were bears, tigers and leopards. I had my own horse (you could say I was very spoilt) and Hailey and I would go riding together (she also had her own horse). We used to keep them behind the school. The villages fields were also behind the hill, sloping downwards. We grew a bit of wheat, but not much, because my dad was more of a business man [business man]. The temple was just a bit out of the town. I wasn't allowed to go and pray. My mother said it was because we weren't Hindus. Our class used to sit out, in the field at the front of the.village when there were carnivals and fÃªtes. There was one main shop and a bank, even though it was only a small village. We used a pump in the centre of the village for our water supply. It was fun to pump it up and down. Well those were the nice, old days, but now, I have to start unpacking the rest of the boxes before my husband comes home and finds the house in a mess.
