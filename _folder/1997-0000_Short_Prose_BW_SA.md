I think our school is a wonderful school in the whole world I love it. Nobody can dare to say any insulting or bad thing about the school. I feel that SHRI MATAJI has started this school with some definite aim. She wants to form a world family in this school.<br>
It looks like one family. If anything goes wrong with any person of this family everybody is ready to give help to him/her.<br> 
It is wonderful to work on each other in SAHAJ YOGA class. I am lucky enough to come to this school. Whole place is full of vibrations, surroundings are most beautiful with enough space to play things of ones own wish.<br>
Students here are not supposed to do any bad thing. We are here to learn to meditate and lead a life of innocence. We are called angels of Sahaj Yoga. We don't study only our text books, we have a big library also where we have so many books to read. Whole compound is full of flowers, Rain God gives us rain every now and then.<br>
I feel that Sun God and Moon are here brighter than anywhere else.
