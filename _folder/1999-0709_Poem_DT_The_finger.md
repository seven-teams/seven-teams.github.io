<p>
The finger pointed outward<br>
Has just one thing to say<br>
Please let me not look inside<br>
It's never been my way<br>
<br>
I see your faults so clearly<br>
Mine I've hidden well<br>
It's you who better change<br>
Who'll know if I don't tell<br>

I've noticed that you're stingy<br>
You're also full of pride<br>
You're showing such poor manners<br>
I even heard you've lied.<br>
<br>
Remarkable, my insights<br>
Don't you think I'm wise<br>
I'm counting on your ego<br>
To hold up my disguise.<br>
</p>
