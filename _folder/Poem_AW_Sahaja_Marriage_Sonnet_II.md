<br>

<p>
Will you love me forever?<br>
A rhetorical question<br>
For we’re both surrendered<br>
To the power that made us.<br>
<br>
Surrender's a catalyst<br>
It remains untouched, unaffected<br>
By the changes it evokes<br>
Having recognized the truth<br>
There’s no viable alternative<br>
To Sat Chit Ananda<br>
And the blessings of the Goddess<br>
To have been in Her direct attention<br>
For the time taken to match us<br>
And for Her to watch and enjoy our response.<br>
</p>
