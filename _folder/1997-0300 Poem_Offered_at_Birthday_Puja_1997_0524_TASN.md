<p>
Divine Mother,<br>
When You first made<br>
The rain drops fall<br>
Did You not see<br>
The parched land awaken?<br>
Just like that<br>
Your showers of Grace<br>
Have fallen upon our once and souls<br>
And we too have felt<br>
Your healing Touch<br>
That eased the yearning Of all our past lives.<br>
<br>
Holy Mother,<br>
When You first allowed<br>
A little stream to flow<br>
A skipping, bubbling brook of delight<br>
Did you not see rivers form<br>
In cascades, torrents<br>
A mighty flow to greet the sea?<br>
Just like that<br>
You've made our joy<br>
Bubble and flood, overflow<br>
In laughter, love and collectivity<br>
As we rush to merge our little drops<br>
into the Great Ocean of Your Being.<br>
<br>
Divine Mother,<br>
When first You fashioned<br>
Tiny saplings<br>
Rooting them firmly upon the earth<br>
Did You not see them straighten<br>
And stand tall<br>
Eager to grow<br>
Upwards and outwards?<br>
Just like that You've rooted us<br>
In the wisdom of the Tree of Life<br>
And now in the cool shade of Your Love<br>
We spread our branches<br>
To all nations and peoples<br>
Eager to carry your message of Salvation<br>
</p>
