<p>
The best way is to pray,<br>
Pray with your heart<br>
Give me strength<br>
That I am not deceiving myself.<br>
<br>
Give me strength that I face myself<br>
That I try to improve myself.<br>
These are defects that are not my own<br>
They are outside, they'll fall off<br>
<br>
Forgive me because I have been ignorant,<br>
I have made mistakes. Please forgive me.<br>
The first thing one has to ask for is<br>
forgiveness.<br>
<br>
Give me a sweet tongue.<br>
By which I become communicative with others,<br>
That they respect me, like me,<br>
And enjoy my presence.<br>
<br>
Oh Lord, give me the sense of security of my Spirit,<br>
That I do not trouble others, or get angry.<br>
Give me sense of my own dignity, so that I do not feel that I am belittled<br>
or that someone has belittled me.<br>
<br>
Give me the witness-state, Give me satisfaction<br>
Wherever my attention is drifting,<br>
Give me Chittanirodh.<br>
Teach me to avoid things that tempt me, that take away my attention.<br>
<br>
Please keep me away from ego<br>
Ideas that I'm superior to others,<br>
Or in any way that takes away my meekness and humility.<br>
Give me natural humility by which I can penetrate into the hearts of people.<br>
