<p>
When I close our eyes and focus our attention at the fontanel bone area, the way of the Kundalini to the Sahasrara is opened and we can feel it on our fingertips as vibrations. If the longing is honest and earnest our mind, with a child-like innocence, achieves very quick results. This way we can actually feel Kundalini rising to the apex Chakra and experience the release of heat and inner tensions. The chakras get cleared and we can see the whole drama as a witness. The Kundalini itself clears all the blockages and allows us to be one with the param chaitanya. After stationing oneself into a thoughtless state we can raise our Kundalini thrice, take bandhan and step ahead. We can show a ray of light through Sahaj eduvation to other people who are ignorant enough to move on the spiritual path. If we have full faith in our Divine Mother, most of our obstacles disappear with little effort. Man, in this Kaliyuga, is running away from the truth that the source of joy lies in his own self. The problem is how to convert one's attention inside and to realise the ascent of the spirit. Through helping everyone to evolve into a higher awareness, this precious heritage of Sahaja Yoga can lead into the Kingdom of Almighty.<br>
