<br>

<p>
I saw creation, nothing less.<br>
Closing my eyes in hospital<br>
for solace, denied egress<br>
from one small spot, a bed,<br>
not so much of pain as rough<br>
discomfort, where battleground<br>
nausea raked my consciousness.<br>
<br>
You cannot will a vision.<br>
It must come, unearned or earned.<br>
I do not moralise, merely conclude<br>
the  universe is given, hence, a gift.<br>
<br>
Mine was the reddest rose<br>
I ever saw. I left it to grow richer,<br>
deeper, unable to think of velvet<br>
or the ruby glass of Chartres<br>
(which came after), but sank<br>
into the redness, into rose<br>
grown from the inner eye, from soul.<br>
<br>
Wondering, I knew<br>
even such redness isn't all:<br>
from the petals, from the throat<br>
came dancing endlessly<br>
the finest, spitting rain of gold,<br>
as fireworks or welders<br>
shower sparks<br>
that fall and fall,<br>
astonishing the eye.<br>
<br>
I understood:<br>
surfaces that seem static<br>
burst with life<br>
of we knew but the frequency.<br>
<br>
Stones hum, bricks shimmer,<br>
the very leaves drip silver.<br>
Air is charged with moving motes.<br>
Life happens every moment:<br>
creation's never done.<br>
<br>
The rose of the world<br>
does not sleep: She<br>
burns on.<br>
</p>
