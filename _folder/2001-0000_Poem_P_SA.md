<p>
Mother Kundalini lies within us,<br>
She is a divine power<br>
She spreads her fragrance through the chakras<br>
Just like a beautiful heavenly flower.<br>
<br>
Then we become thoughtlessly aware<br>
Forgetting our past deeds<br>
Letting out all the negativities, with care<br>
We tread on the path to self-realization that leads<br>
<br>
Then enlightening the chakras with splendor flowing,<br>
Kundalini reaches Sahasrara, the Adi Sahakti's throne<br>
And makes that lotus bloom in thousand petals glowing<br>
Leaving below her dwelling, the sacred bone<br>
<br>
Then vibrations, light, bliss everywhere<br>
She is kundalini and you are in her care.
</p>
