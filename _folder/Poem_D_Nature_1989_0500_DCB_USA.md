<p>
Contemplate the immensity of the ocean<br>
My brothers and sisters,<br>
Enjoy the majesty of the mountains,<br>
Discover the beautiful music of the rivers dancing<br>
In their beds of stones and grass,<br>
Appreciate the songs of the birds<br>
And the birth of the leaves after the white winter,<br>
Enjoy the harmony of nature,<br>
Bathed by the refreshing wind,<br>
Like the sound of the flute which spreads<br>
In the depth of the forest,<br>
Feel all around, from the North to the South,<br>
From the East to the West<br>
The completeness of the creation<br>
And bow before its Doer, the Adi Shakti.<br>
How would the Sun shine,<br>
How would the Moon spread its silver glance<br>
On the surface of the Earth,<br>
How would the wind gently strike with tenderness<br>
The radiance of our faces,<br>
How would life pulsate,<br>
If Shri Mataji, our Mother,<br>
Would not in Her unreachable Greatness<br>
Coordinate, plan and master the whole show<br>
From the depth of Her Heart and the splendour of Her being?<br>
Don't forget, my brothers and sisters!<br>
We smile, because our Mothers miles through us,<br>
We dance because She let the divine rhythm of the Pulsation of Her<br>
Heart penetrate into us,<br>
We sing because She allows the exquisite music of Her Voice irradiate<br>
the totality of our being,<br>
We enjoy because our spirit if filled with the Parabrahma Itself, and we<br>
are what we are because of Her love for The devotees, Immeasurable<br>
love, deeper than the ocean,<br>
Vaster than the universe and higher than the firmaments.
