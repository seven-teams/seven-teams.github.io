<p>
In the book of Revelations very little is revealed,<br>
From the furtive intellectual are the answers well concealed.<br>
Perhaps if we stop asking questions we may hope to crack the code,<br>
Maybe the desire for inner wisdom will lead us on the road.<br>
What are the cogent questions of the great quest for life?<br>
Who are the real protagonists that lead men ever on to strife?<br>
How can we find the answers if we don't know where to start?<br>
How join in the cosmic drama if we don't know our own part?<br>
<br>
Where is the One who is Alpha and Omega?<br>
Where is the One who will call it the day?<br>
Did the seers of old merely write stirring stories?<br>
No. They foresaw through the tunnel of time where the war is.<br>
This war's raging within us; the prize mankind's soul,<br>
Because man is a mirror, microcosm of God.<br>
The dragons and devils are here now, among us,<br>
All doing their best to appearâ€”Oh, so good!<br>
Bombardments of evil sport disguises of freedom,<br>
Self-destruction's allowed, nothing's barred from us now.<br>
But the Woman is here, with the stars in Her crown,<br>
And we are Her manchild, if we understand how.<br>
She is here to effect a transmuting of consciousness:<br>
If She doesn't, there'll soon be naught left to transmute.<br>
When She gives the great secrets, quite freely, in earnestness,<br>
Then Her Spirit will fill us as sound fills a flute.<br>
Then we'll dance for the Dancers, the Lords of Creation,<br>
And we'll bow to Our Maker in wonder and love.<br>
But first we must seek Her, concealed in our wilderness,<br>
Not argue and question what comes from above.<br>
When in silent humility we'll admit we'ere just human,<br>
Then She'll come as a human bringing heaven on earth.<br>
She'll show us our Spirit and make us divine,<br>
And Her Son will through man have His own second birth.<br>

  <list-item color="BlanchedAlmond"  width="280"><b>Article 'Alpha and Omega' from 1983-0300 and 0400 Nirmala Yoga, Pages 43 and 44:</b> [Before the poem:] "Here is a poem which hopefully explains two passages in the book of Revelations, which is the last book of the New Testament of the Bible. The Revelations is a book considered very obscure and difficult to understand and is a prophetic work deal- ing with the coming of the New Jerusalem. John of Patmos, who wrote the book, was somewhat supraconscious and therefore not to be taken too literally, although much is very true and relevant to the present time. First the passages from Revelations, and then the poem, the first part of which is intended for groping western seekers rather than Sahaja Yogis.<br>
" 'I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending,' saith the Lord, 'which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty'." Chap. I, verse 8.<br>
"And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed in the sun, and the moon under Her feet, and upon Her head a crown of twelve stars And She being with child cried, travailing in birth and pained to be delivered.<br>
And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his heads. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them upon the earth : and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour Her child as soon as it was born.<br>
And She brought forth a man child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and Her child was caught up unto God and to His throne. And the woman fled into the wilderness, where She had a place prepared of God that they should feed Her there..." Chap. 12, verses 1-6.<br>
'The woman' is of course Shri Mataji, 'the dragon' the negativity in the form of the false gurus, and 'the rod of iron' must refer to the Kundalini, which is also described in this manner in the beautiful 23rd Psalm."<br>
This is the poem: [The poem above.]<br>
[After the poem:] "Om twamewa sakshat Shri Kalki, sakshat Shri Adi Shakti, sakshat Shri Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi, Namo Namah.<br>
Twamekam Sharanyam gaechami."</list-item>
