<p>
When you get the gift of Self-realization<br>
Keep your attention only on Shri Mataji<br>
Don't worry about who said what to whom<br>
Keep your attention only on Shri Mataji<br>
<br>
And when you walk down the street<br>
Focus on what's between the ground<br>
And a meter high<br>
That way you'll see the best of what's to see.<br>
<br>
When you get enlightened<br>
It's your attention that's enlightened<br>
So keep it pure and clean<br>
Treat it for what it is, a gift from God, a precious jewel.<br>
<br>
Don't sully it, defile it,<br>
Let nonsense beguile it<br>
Your attention is free<br>
So pay attention to your attention.<br>
<br>
Where is my attention?<br>
Is a good question to ask<br>
It'll refocus it<br>
Make you aware of where it is<br>
<br>
Beware of those who set out to capture the attention of others<br>
Those who say outrageous things<br>
Tell outrageous lies, create fads<br>
Just to capture the attention of the many<br>
<br>
A person who is connected to the divine<br>
Is a very subtle being<br>
Neither he nor she allows their attention<br>
To drift far from the Lotus Feet of their Mother.<br>
