<b>Chorus:</b><br>
Oh the Kingdom of Heaven is here<br>
And Your Majesty rules from within<br>
Your name is Goddess Nirmala<br>
Speechless, we are blessed with Your darshan<br>
<b>Verse 1:</b><br>
Wisdom of the ages in the children’s eyes.<br>
A cool breeze from a havan and diamonds in the sky.<br>
What a place, what a place, what a wondrous place.<br>
What a race, what a race, what a marvellous race.<br>
What a sight! What a life! What a time! What a time to be a-live!<br>
<b>Chorus (x2)</b><br>
<b>Verse 2:</b><br>
Faces growing younger with a timeless light.<br>
Voices of angels sing through the night.<br>
What a place, what a place, what a wondrous place.<br>
What a race, what a race, what a marvellous race.<br>
What a sight! What a life! What a time! What a time to be a-live!<br>
<b>Chorus (x2)</b><br>
<b>Verse 3:</b><br>
Miracles and stories, too many to record.<br>
Beyond our biggest dreams, a new reality unfolds.<br>
What a place, what a place, what a wondrous place.<br>
What a race, what a race, what a marvellous race.<br>
What a sight! What a life! What a time! What a time to be a-live!<br>
<b>Chorus...</b><br>

The sunsets were spectacular. One evening as the sun was setting, the moon was rising and the sky was laden with these two opposing forces. It was such a powerful sight that I wrote a song in which I tried to capture my experience and feelings as I stood foot soaking in the ocean, here are the words: [see above]."</list-item>
