<p>
When the Chitta returns to Sushumna and ascends to Sahasrara,<br>
"Ma" is the sound of that Sacred Shakti.<br>
When I take refuge in the golden-red shaft of security that. is the path of Kundalini,<br>
"Ma' is the sound of my inward-turning.<br>
When the Maya recedes and the tree of Reality blossoms joyfully within,<br>
"Ma" is the sound of that silence.<br>
When my courage spontaneously surges forth like the gathering wave on the ocean of Dharma,<br>
"Ma" is the sound of that enlightened motion.<br>
When the pain of attachment falls away to reveal the purest sweet compassion and joy,<br>
"Ma" is the sound of that ecstatic release.<br>
"Ma" is the sound of my folded hands, rising and saluting Thee<br>
"Ma" is the sound of my head bowing in reverence to Thee.<br>
M a " is the sound my being, blissfully vibrating and resting in Thee.<br>
