<p>
"At home in exile", quipped the poet Mahon<br>
Made no sense.<br>
Ostracized, banished, in exilium,<br>
It was hard to be any of these at home.<br>
For me it was complex,<br>
I was born in the right place.<br>
It just took me an inordinately long time to see it.<br>
<br>
Unspoken shibboleths of the north<br>
They knew what you meant without you saying a word<br>
As alien to me<br>
As a palm tree on Napoleon's Nose.<br>
<br>
More than halfway through life's journey,<br>
I found myself<br>
Silent in a host of saints and angels<br>
In a blue, leaky circus tent, in Cabella, Liguria<br>
On concrete steps Ganapatipule, Maharashtra.<br>
In a barn near Canajoharie, upstate in New York.<br>
A scout camp, Nizamuddin, New Delhi
Sleeping in Red Army tents in primordial forest, Gorny Altai<br>
In a desert cloudburst.<br>
Lake Piru, California, USA.<br>
Shudycamps, Cambridgeshire, the New Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
No strangers anywhere<br>
I knew them all from wav back<br>
From their vibrations, from their hearts.<br>
<br>
Home is where I sleep tonight.<br>
<br>
In Shri Mataji's room at 4 am I knew her divinity.<br>

Derek Mahon, a Belfast poet, wrote of his native city, "at home in exile" I was always an outsider there but I didn't understand or feel that way. Napoleon's Nose, shown in the background of my poem, is a mountain that overlooks Belfast. I only ceased to be an outsider in the Sahaja Yoga collective."</list-item>
