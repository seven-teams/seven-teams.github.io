<br>

<p>
I have never wanted to hold a woman<br>
as much as I yearn for you,<br>
for the sweet heavy weight I tested,<br>
yearly, as you grew.<br>
<br>
Now memory is the scent<br>
I search while you sleep at dawn:<br>
is it peaches, wheat ears, milk?<br>
Some essence of daughter, warm<br>
<br>
With the musk of your hair:<br>
from that strong blonde crown<br>
that gives you despair<br>
as it bushes and flares, growing low<br>
<br>
From your forehead like a frown.<br>
Wait and see! Your hair will be your glory yet.<br>
And I give you yourself at twenty: tall,<br>
fair, and wearing the garments of then,<br>
<br>
But always reminding watchers of wheat,<br>
of the farms they have known, and the folds<br>
of white robes loosely waisted with gold,<br>
sheaves rocked in your arms.<br>
</p>
