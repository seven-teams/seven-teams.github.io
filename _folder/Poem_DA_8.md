<br>

<p>
In the beginning<br>
When my Lord disappeared behind the tree of life<br>
When "I" was cast though the veil<br>
When my love of matter slayed my love for god<br>
Time appeared and held my hand<br>
When knowledge covered over my innocence<br>
When pleasure and pride filled my newly formed mind<br>
When intellect formed a scab over my eyes<br>
Comfort took hold of my reigns and guided my prancing thoughts<br>
Where lays the crack in this veil?<br>
The heart seems to know<br>
What the mind can't perceive<br>
I seek and sense it closeness<br>
But every thought merely strengthens the separation<br>
</p>
