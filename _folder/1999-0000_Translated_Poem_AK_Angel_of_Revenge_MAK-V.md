<p>
To the people: I am the glum Angel of Revenge!<br>
And in the wounds of the plowed virgin soil<br>
I sow my seeds. The waiting time is over.<br>
My voice is the toxin. My banner is of blood.<br>
<br>
And on the patches of hate among the loathing crowds<br>
I'll grow ghostly flowers of death.<br>
And in the heart of a teen I'll put a thrill of killing<br>
And in a child's soul - bloody dreams.<br>
And mind shall fall in love with gory human slaughter.<br>
I will extinguish happiness with tears.<br>
And I will rob a woman's heart of holy pity<br>
And blind her eyes with dull and adamant rage.<br>
I will awaken paving stones of city squares<br>
That have already tasted blood. I know their story.<br>
And I will curse those stones with an eternal thirst,<br>
And blood for blood shall flow without measure.<br>
And I will tell the rioter: "I bless your cardboard sword<br>
With an unconquerable strength of angry steel!"<br>
And in the alleys of the cities, where women were tortured,<br>
I'll draw the signs of 'Pisces' on the walls.<br>
And with a flame of blue I'll pass though the souls of the people,<br>
And with a flame of red I'll pass through the cities.<br>
Through the mouth of everyone, I will exclaim: "Freedom!"<br>
But a different meaning for everyone I will give.<br>
<br>
I will write: "My Covenant is Justice!"<br>
And the enemy will read: "No mercy, no more" ...<br>
I'll give enticing beauty to a Murder,<br>
And the avenger will be seduced by a passionate delirium.<br>
The Sword of Justice - retributive and punishing -<br>
I will give to the crowds ... And in the hands of the blind<br>
This sword will flash like a rapid, smashing lightning -<br>
With this sword a son will murder his mother,<br>
And a daughter will kill her father.<br>
And I will tell everyone: "You have The Keys of Hope.<br>
YOU ONLY see the truth, while all others are blind!"<br>
And he or she will cry and tear their clothes in despair<br>
And call to others for help... But everyone will be deaf.<br>
The Sower will not keep the stinging weeds of the harvest.<br>
Whosoever took the sword shall perish by the sword.<br>
Whosoever drank the intoxicating poison of anger<br>
He will become an avenger or a victim of an avenger.
