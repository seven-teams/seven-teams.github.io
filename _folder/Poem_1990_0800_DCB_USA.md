<br>

<p>
When I see you so much lovingly coming ...<br>
Then the whole Heart becomes like an ocean ...<br>
And just starts -- like a big swell of a tide.<br>
Like that,<br>
I see that,<br>
And then when I have to leave you<br>
Again it recedes back like a sea which is<br>
Now receding.<br>
<br>
It is something like you see the moon,<br>
And the sea starts reacting to the beauty<br>
of the moon;<br>
The joy of the moon;<br>
The love of the moon.<br>
Then I see the Love:<br>
The Love that is, you see, in a nest<br>
Where the bird is feeding its young ones.<br>
<br>
Then you see this Love in the sky!<br>
Then you see this Love in your heart!<br>
And the only thing that you can describe<br>
Is the feeling of that tremendous ocean of joy<br>
Within you:<br>
Just flowing out.
</p>
