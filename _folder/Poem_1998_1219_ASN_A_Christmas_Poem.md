<p>
Christmas is a time of cheer<br>
That comes at the end of every year<br>
To celebrate Christ's birthday<br>
And not only to give presents away.<br>
<br>
So every girl and eery boy:<br>
Mother has come to give us joy.<br>
So on this day in every nation<br>
We pray to you, Mother, for your vibration.<br>
<br>
Our agnya opens on this day<br>
And all our negativity goes away.<br>
Your vibrations are as cool as a river<br>
That always come to clear our liver.<br>
<br>
And so with your face so radiant and bright<br>
We pray to you with strength and might.<br>
</p>
