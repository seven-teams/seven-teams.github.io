<p>
I wandered alone life's long lonely byways<br>
In darkness no pole star to lighten my way<br>
Made too many mistakes took many wrong turnings<br>
Then one day I met Shri Mataji Devi<br>
<br>
Through the divine discretion She planted in me<br>
She let me see what my eyes couldn't see<br>
And knowing the truth as an absolute thing<br>
Was one of the great gifts She bestowed upon me<br>
<br>
Success is a construct, a myth, an illusion,<br>
It flows through the fingers like fine grains of sand<br>
And leaves little trace on the palm of the hand<br>
And nothing at all in the memory of man<br>
<br>
She gave me a wife and Self realization<br>
Treasures beyond mere measure or price<br>
She gave me the tools to improve myself<br>
And the discretion divine to see it happen<br>
<br>
And in Her presence divine to live life sublime<br>
