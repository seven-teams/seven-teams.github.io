<p>
Few were fit for the gift She gave<br>
Being weak in the witness state<br>
And it needs a mention<br>
Weak in the control of their Attention<br>
<br>
Indeed all have fallen short, so<br>
Focus then on what needs correction in ourselves<br>
Not on the faults of others<br>
We can fix the former, do nothing of the latter.<br>
<br>
What we become depends on how we use of our Attention<br>
It's a choice we make, mostly unaware when making it.<br>
Aware, we come to know Chitta nirodha<br>
She who controls our Attention<br>
<br>
Let's desire, let's ask for Nirmal Chitta, for pure Attention.<br>
Let's request the Attention of Chitt'eshawari, Goddess of Attention<br>
Let's desire, let's ask for Chit-shakti<br>
The power of Attention<br>
<br>
May the Prophet Muhammed cleanse and invigorate<br>
The seat of our Attention<br>
May Mukut'eshwari <br>
Protect its functions<br>
<br>
May Ati-kriya relax overactivity in us<br>
May vichara shaithilya relax our Attention<br>
May sarva tapa harini remove all heat<br>
And Shri Chandrama keep us cool<br>
<br>
May we access Lord Krishna's Sudarshan Chakra<br>
the weapon of Auspicious Vision.<br>
May we ascend to Nirvikalpa and<br>
Be pleasing in the sight of our Holy Mother.<br>
