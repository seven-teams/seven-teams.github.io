<p>
From where I stand<br>
In the sunrise<br>
I behold a Land<br>
Right before my eyes<br>
<br>
There attachments dissolve<br>
The body is healed<br>
Worldly riddles are solved<br>
Sacred truths are revealed<br>
<br>
In the present, in peace<br>
Plagued no more by dreams<br>
of what might have been<br>
Or what yet might be.<br>
<br>
Subtle colour, subtle light<br>
A land cool and pure<br>
Joy by day, peace by night<br>
Mother's presence is there<br>
<br>
Her smile is the sun<br>
Her radiance, the moon<br>
In the waters She runs<br>
In the clouds She moves<br>
<br>
She laughs in the leaves<br>
of the trees as they blow<br>
Her fragrance unfolds<br>
In the flowers that grow<br>
<br>
From where I stand<br>
In the sunrise<br>
I behold a Land<br>
Right before my eyes<br>
<br>
I can reach that Land<br>
By my dear Mother's grace<br>
She takes my hand;<br>
I set the pace<br>
<br>
I can dwell in that land<br>
Watch the Play from above<br>
At one with the truth<br>
In God's Kingdom of Love.<br>
</p>
