<p>
The seeking by the population<br>
For nourishment of the soul<br>
Has come to God's attention<br>
Best send someone for that role.<br>
<br>
That person is the "Comforter"<br>
Incarnated to do this job<br>
Of revealing all the knowledge<br>
Before false gurus do Spirit rob.<br>
<br>
The "Comforter" is available now<br>
I make no idle boast<br>
Sahaja Yoga can actually show<br>
That Shri Mataji is the Holy Ghost.<br>
<br>
This claim can be verified<br>
When self-realisation does occur<br>
Then the cool breeze testifies<br>
Who is false and who is pure.<br>
<br>
So forget your religious dogma<br>
Forget your personal beliefs<br>
Take the test of Sahaja Yoga<br>
Practice diligently for three weeks.<br>
<br>
And when the Goddess does enter<br>
Into your new awareness<br>
Recognise who has sent Her<br>
Jesus, the King of Forgiveness.<br>
</p>
