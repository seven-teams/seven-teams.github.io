<p>
Our School, being situated in Talnoo, is rather cut off from the rest of the society but in order to acquaint ourselves with some of the other children in the area, we have adopted a smaller village School. The School is called Totarani and is situated near Dal lake, which is only a short drive from the school.<br>
On the 7th of November, some children were selected for the first visit to the School.<br>
On arriving at the school, the children, which were about 200 in number sang a warm welcoming song in Hindi, and then the students from our school performed a few Sahaj Bhajans. After this a small cultural programme was performed by the students of the Totarani School, including some traditional Pahari dances.<br>
Then a speech was given by our Director Shri H.N. Kaul and gifts were given to the children individually, as well as sweets, which we're sure they appreciated greatly.
