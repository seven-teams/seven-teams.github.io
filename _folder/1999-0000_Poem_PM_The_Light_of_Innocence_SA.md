<p>
The innocence comes put of a hidden case,<br>
Blooming and showing in a child's face,<br>
His eyes so beautifully shine,<br>
Showing in him works of the Divine,<br>
Which drains away the dark in sight,<br>
Like crowns of gold brought in the light.<br>
<br>
Looking so innocent and pleasing to the eyes,<br>
Which the child itself does not realize,<br>
It enjoys its innocence so sweet and profound,<br>
Like nature enjoys its natural sounds.<br>
<br>
The winter threatens, where the forests lay,<br>
But the birds forgives, though driven away<br>
it's in its nature to be sweet,<br>
Unchanged by influence of negative heart.<br>
<br>
With innocence we see the world,<br>
Awakened from its troubled curl,<br>
It makes or enjoys what God gave,<br>
And brings us out of our dark care.<br>
