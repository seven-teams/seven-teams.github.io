<br>

<p>
And was She wearing blue that day, His Mother?<br>
When She called Him to Her side to say<br>
The wedding would be spoilt unless<br>
He would vibrate the water in those casks because<br>
I seemed the grape juice - which<br>
<br>
Their hosts had spent all the last night treading-<br>
Had been found depleted by this afternoon.<br>
<br>
They say He hesitated for a pause to ask<br>
Was this the moment which had always been appointed<br>
And was His work, indeed, now to be done?<br>
Under the shade of trellised vines<br>
The Mother quietly looks at Her Son.<br>
Perhaps they were smiling a little because they foresaw<br>
How the point of the story would be misconstrued<br>
And His blessing on weddings mistaken, in error, for wine.</p>
