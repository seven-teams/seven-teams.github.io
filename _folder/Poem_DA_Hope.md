<br>

<p>
I have wondered what is pain?<br>
I have lingered long in the rain<br>
Confusion has muddled and bound me<br>
While above the clouds shined the sun's rays<br>
And within the winter has slept a spring day<br>
I have laughed at the truth within myself<br>
I have coerced confessions out of the dark side of me<br>
I have doubted my worth and found many faults<br>
Yet still, I pine for the waves of pleasant sounds to<br>
reach my island's shore<br>
Friendly voices, fountains and springs<br>
And love from another<br>
For another being<br>
I have held on, and believe it to be true<br>
And every day feeds my beliefs<br>
Till in my garden, there is plenty to eat<br>
</p>
