<p>
What do you see in her deep brown eyes?<br>
I see love, compassion and forgiveness.<br>
What do you hear when she talks so calmly?<br>
I hear music, harmony and laughter.<br>
What can you see on her face when she smiles?<br>
I see amusement wisdom and affection.<br>
What do we know about Our Spiritual Mother, Shri<br>
Mataii Nirmala Devi?<br>
W e know t h a t she is our spiritual mother.<br>
And we know that we are all her children.<br>
Let us all be peaceful and surrender to Mother.<br>
Let mother's love help us realise ourselves.<br>
</p>
