<p>
The wish of Truth inside us burns<br>
And mind is tortured by<br>
Ten thousands why<br>
Unsure what to do and what to try<br>
For spiritual thirst.<br>
The thunderstorms of thoughts books are pouring from above<br>
But we don't care for words, we ask for Love:<br>
<br>
Within our inner shrine there is a thirst for Pure Love...<br>
... If in the City of Joy you have lost your way<br>
And busy life is making you to live your days away<br>
And if your mind just seems to be like a maze of highways<br>
That lead nowhere,<br>
Don't leave the Hope, call for Mother, take Her hand<br>
Your every beat of heart She understands<br>
And never ends the presence of Her Love.<br>
</p>
