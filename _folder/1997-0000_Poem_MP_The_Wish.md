<p>
There was once a Monkey,<br>
That made friends with a Donkey,<br>
Their wish was to go to the Moon,<br>
Very, very soon.<br>
<br>
Or to a different Planet,<br>
So they had to plan it,<br>
They thought all night long,<br>
First they thought to go to Honk Kong.<br>
<br>
But no, they couldn't decide,<br>
Where to ride,<br>
Suddenly they heard a noise,<br>
What was their choice.<br>
<br>
They sat there,<br>
Not knowing where,<br>
One of them sat on the chair,<br>
And listened to the scare.<br>
<br>
And guess what it was,<br>
It was a little mouse,<br>
That came out of it's house,<br>
It said: " I heard you talking".<br>
It was walking,<br>
Towards them.<br>
<br>
The friends were surprised,<br>
One of them raised,<br>
And said: "So please can you help us?"<br>
"Of course I can help you two."<br>
"I have got a magic spoon,<br>
That can bring you to the moon".<br>
<br>
"You ride on it, and decide,<br>
Where you want to go"<br>
They sat on it,<br>
Just a bit.<br>
<br>
They decided to go to the moon,<br>
With this magic spoon,<br>
So they did,<br>
And were happy what they did,<br>
"Good bye", said the little mouse<br>
And wen back in its house.
