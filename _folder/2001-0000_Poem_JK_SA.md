<p>
Have you ever watched the kids on a merry-go-round?<br>
Or listened to the rain slapping on the ground?<br>
Ever followed a butterfly's erratic flight?<br>
Or gazed at the sun into the fading night?<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You better slow down<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Don't dance so fast<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Time is short - the music won't last<br>
Do you run through each day on the fly?<br>
When you ask, "How are you?"<br>
Do you hear the reply?<br>
When the day is done, do you lie in your bed with the next hundred chores running in your head?<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You better slow down<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Don't dance so fast<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Time is short - the music won't last<br>
Ever told your child, we'll do it tomorrow<br>
And in your haste not see his sorrow?<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Ever lost touch,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Let a good friendship die<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Cause you never had time<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To call up and say, "Hi"?<br>
When you run so fast to get somewhere<br>
You miss half the fun of getting there<br>
When you worry and hurry through your day<br>
It is like an unopened gift-------thrown away.<br>
Life is not a race, do take it slower<br>
Hear the music before the song is over.
</p>
