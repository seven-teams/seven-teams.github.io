<br>

<p>
Bask in a simple beauty.<br>
Prophets of time.<br>
Your laughter is the melody of Auroras' sunrise. Aver to us seers, unto our famished ears.<br>
For we pine for every meaning.<br>
Which you place upon so clear.<br>
Enunciate to us prophets, a lesson we may hold dear.<br>
<br>
Bask in a simple beauty. Prophets of time.<br>
Your laughter is the melody.<br>
Of Gods' early morning sunrise. Bask in a simple beauty.<br>
<br>
Gaze into a nest.<br>
See the fragile eggs. Imagine in time the rest.<br>
</p>
