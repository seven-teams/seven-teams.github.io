<br>

<p>
Seven are the mills of God.<br>
Single is the empty tomb.<br>
One thousand petalled lotuses<br>
Are blooming at the crown.<br>
Three are the secret ways,<br>
Devised to overcome.<br>
Many are the lesser ways,<br>
Upsetting equilibrium.<br>
Fourteen rainbows fashioning<br>
A self protective spell.<br>
Behold the many-stranded jewel.<br>
The Queen of Fontanelle.<br>
Four are the Equestrians,<br>
Who thunder through the night.<br>
Beware the fire of Kalaki,<br>
With horse candescent white.<br>
Eleven are the fangs of God;<br>
Uncounted is the sin<br>
Of those who open up their hearts<br>
And let the Mother in.<br>
Unnumbered is the silence:<br>
Incalculable the worth.<br>
Behold, upon the palm of God,<br>
The boon of second birth!
</p>
