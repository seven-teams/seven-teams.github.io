<p>
I remember one day in India, in a rural place, in the foothills of the Himalaya's, along the side of the River Yamuna.<br>
<br>
We worshipped in great pendals covered in enormous cotton sheets.<br>
We all sat, more than six hundred.<br>
The Indian cotton fabric keeping the sun from beating down upon on our heads.<br>
<br>
I saw the Paramchaitanya creep in through a gap, in the corner of one of the cotton sides.<br>
<br>
She came in and gently blew all the large heads of the hundreds of flowers, just as a spring breeze blows across the Mother Earth.<br>
