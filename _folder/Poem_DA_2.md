<br>

<p>
A cocoon I've built
With mire<br>
With illusion<br>
Seeking some comfort<br>
Where comfort was not<br>
<br>
Oh Mother, God<br>
With a glint I saw you<br>
I placed you as fiber on the walls<br>
But your love, your compassion<br>
Cracked the walls<br>
<br>
Surrender is the way<br>
Unto the force that matures me<br>
Changing me, bit by bit.<br>
</p>
