<p>
This topic is very much talked about all around the world. These two subjects are very important in our day to day life. Man is only in a good position if his surrounding is pure and clean. The environment of a place is very important to the people. The people of the world usually want to live somewhere, where there are plenty of trees, plants, animals and pure air. Men will live closer to Nature and try to avoid city life as much as they can. City life is not inviting and is very hard to live in. On the other hand, towards Nature, villages are created and established. In these areas a lot of the population of the world have made their homes. For example in India, 80\% of the population are villagers and do hard work in the fields. The environment in these areas is peaceful, harmonious, joyful and nice. It is also very spiritual.
<br>
Man has degraded himself from Nature and is not really caring so much for it. Man has cut down so many trees and plants. Instead of these trees, they have constructed buildings and other things. What is the use of this? Nothing. This is making everything worse. The plants and trees are dead. So now they cannot produce Oxygen for the human beings. Whatever the human beings receive they give out Carbondioxide[.] But as mentioned before there are no trees left so the carbon dioxide gets collected in the air and makes it impure. Pollution is  also a big disadvantage for safe and pure environment. Now a days more and more transportation facilities are established and the smoke comes out and runs clean air, which in turn causes diseases when breathed in.<br>
<br>
Man has made a major mistake. He has spoilt his surroundings and will have to pay back for it. God will make sure. Man should look after his environment.
