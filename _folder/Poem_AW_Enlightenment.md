<p>
In my early teens I spent a weeks pocket money<br>
On a book on Zen<br>
Didn't understand it much, if at all.<br>
<br>
Thirty three years later,<br>
No understanding necessary<br>
Swamped in a tidal wave of love,<br>
There was no mistaking what came my way and why.<br>
<br>
The ascendant Kundalini<br>
Established a direct connection<br>
With the unconscious<br>
Beyond thought, verified as a vibrational flow of bliss.<br>
<br>
I knew my life had changed<br>
That what I'd always sought,<br>
through all the years that passed<br>
This gift beyond price, was made manifest.<br>
<br>
It didn't come cheap<br>
There was a price to pay<br>
Total surrender to the divine power<br>
Ego and superego sucked back into Ida and Pingala nadis.<br>
<br>
Knowing spiritual concepts is easy enough<br>
Knowing them through direct experience<br>
Is the hard part<br>
The only part that matters.<br>
<br>
God is not your concept<br>
For concept is thought<br>
The divine is not to be found there or in a book.<br>
<br>
They, deities, each aspects of the divine within.<br>
In inbuilt centers of spiritual energy,<br>
Patiently waiting, lifetime after lifetime,<br>
To be recognized, reconnected.<br>
