<p>
Mother,<br>
In my soul, heart, body, mind,<br>
wold, universe<br>
The ever pervading power,<br> 
A drop of purity in the black<br>
&emsp;&emsp;black ocean of evil.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;Mother,<br>
You reside in the flower, sand,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;wetter, sun, moon,<br>
Your beauty is divine to my eyes,<br>
Ekes that only saw dark<br>
&nbsp;now<br>
Shines, sees you and only you<br>
&nbsp;in everything,<br> 
&nbsp;everyone, everywhere,<br>
My whole being seeks,<br>
&nbsp;craves, prays,<br> 
&nbsp;only to attain you.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;Mother,<br>
From you, I have learned<br>
&nbsp;the wonders of oneself,<br>
You delivered knowledge,<br>
&nbsp;patience, beauty,<br>
You took LOVE<br>
and placed it on my mead,<br>
Love enveloped me,<br>
flowed through me,<br>
in & out,<br>
Up and down,<br>
through every single cell.<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;Mother,<br>
You are the fire,
The birds flying free in the sky,<br>
Winds that blow through the frees,<br>
The waves of the milky ocean,<br>
The rhythm of all music,<br>
Music to my soul,<br>
Splashing of the water,<br>
Clapping of the hands,<br>
Every breath,<br>
The smell of the<br>
&emsp;&sweetest of flowers.<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;Mother,<br>
You are the sun emitting vibrations,<br>
You are the sounds,<br>
words, alphabets.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;Mother,<br>
The divine purity of Cod,<br>
So Divine,<br>
White, pure, beautiful,<br>
wonderful, tremendous,<br>
exciting, heart and soul.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;Mother,<br>
You gave me life,<br> 
the essence,<br>
The patience,<br>
beauty, love<br>
You gave me vibrations,<br>
&nbsp;Vibrations that united the broken universe,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;vibrations that made the flowers bloom,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vibrations that gave us peace,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vibrations that made us grow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vibrations that made our souls flourish with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;divine happiness and joy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vibrations that made us smile,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;laugh, cry, giggl,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vibrations that made us fall on our knees,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vibrations that glowed in our faces and eyes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vibrations that gave me courage,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vibrations that save me YOU,<br>
&nbsp;And most important of all,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vibrations that gave me MYSELF.<br>
</p>
