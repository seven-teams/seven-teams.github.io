<br>
One day I saw a fly,<br>
squashed it but it did not die,<br>
I picked it up and put it in my sister's pie,<br>
She ate it and started to cry,<br>
She told my mum and I had to lie,<br>
told her I didn't mean to make her cry,<br>
Then my mum said "Nice try!"<br>
She went to get the wooden spoon<br>
and I said "Cood bye!"
<p>
