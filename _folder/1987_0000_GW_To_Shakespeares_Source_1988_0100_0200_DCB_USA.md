<p>
0h great Love, there is but one, You are it.<br>
In Your honor do I now dare discourse.<br>
With head humbled, my heart draws strength and wit,<br>
From your loving emissions and true force.<br>
Many, not so many enjoy your joy,<br>
Such a privilege is not just earned, is giv'n.<br>
Sweet service of Love through life's glossy ploy.<br>
And sheens of superficiality, wane.<br>
Through my scant verse I pray your essence shine,<br>
Not on deaf ears, deaf minds, but the beauty,<br>
Sweetly watching and awaiting the time,<br>
When at its height, arrogance will dizzy.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Then will You, gentle might, surely win,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Your eager treasure, the Spirit within.
</p>
