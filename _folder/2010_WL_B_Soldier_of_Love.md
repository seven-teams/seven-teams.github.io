<p style="text-align:center;">
I am a soldier of love<br>
Not the stupid kind of love<br>
but intelligent love, the love that understands<br>
The love that cares, the love that wants to help evolving<br>
<br>
The Mother has given me weapons for my war of love<br>
<br>
She has given me forgiveness<br>
Not the tolerant and accepting kind of forgiveness<br>
But forgiveness, which is sincere, forgiveness that does correct<br>
Forgiveness which frees the heart to love, frees the heart to speak<br>
<br>
She has given me the gift of knowledge<br>
Not the knowledge gained from books or universities<br>
but knowledge from experiences<br>
<br>
Knowledge grown from observation<br>
Knowledge, which gives benevolence<br>
Knowledge that opens up the mind<br>
<br>
But most of all<br>
She has given me a heart with courage<br>
Courage to love without the need for recognition<br>
Courage to forgive without the fear of tolerating wrong<br>
Courage to understand the needs of others,<br>
Courage to speak the truth<br>
<br>
At this time, I’m still in training for my war of love<br>
My weapons still need honing, my marksmanship improvement<br>
My heart has still to grow; my mind needs still expanding<br>
<br>
But the battle plan is laid, the purpose of the war is clear<br>
<br>
Humanity needs to be conquered<br>
with love, forgiveness and with knowledge<br>
<br>
Humanity needs to be conquered<br>
to gain freedom for the hearts and minds and souls
