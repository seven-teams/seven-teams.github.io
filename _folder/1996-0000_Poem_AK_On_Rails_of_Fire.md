<p>
On Rails of Fire<br>
the Train of Life<br>
Is rushing through<br>
The country side<br>
Through silent lands you go deep<br>
Where joys and worries are asleep<br>
And then in evening’s humble verse<br>
You’ll hear the pulse of the Universe<br>
The pulse of Love inside your being<br>
The flow of Love the heart would bring<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Across the night,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Across the day,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Beyond the Time<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;That flies away,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And all the wars and troubles you cross<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To pour Love on the Universe. . .<br>
<br> 
The night is dark<br>
When only Star of hatred<br>
Lies on its Altar<br>
But if you simply open your heart,<br>
It’ll bring the world Another Light, so<br>
Let your Spirit shine across<br>
The battlefields of the Universe:<br>
There is no force that is stronger than Love<br>
All the weapons melt in the Fire of Love . . .<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Across the night,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Across the day,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Beyond the Time<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;That flies away,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And all the wars and troubles you cross<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To bring Peace to the Universe.<br>
<br> 
The winds of hatred, the snow and rain<br>
They cannot stop or slow your Train<br>
The life might want to hit you hard<br>
But There Is God inside your heart!<br>
And if you want to help the world<br>
Become a flute in the hands of God<br>
And let the melody of Grace<br>
Just flow freely through the space<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Across the night,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Across the day,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Beyond the Time<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;That flies away,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Beyond empires that fall and rise<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;TO TURN THE EARTH INTO PARADISE . . .
