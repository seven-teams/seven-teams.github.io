<p>
No Surrender, that bellowed mantra of<br>
an Orange Ulster childhood,<br>
But thankfully not in my case,<br>
It was heard not embraced.<br>
<br>
London, still September dawning, Golden Square<br>
Venerable, aged Chinese doing Tai Chi<br>
Elegance and grace, magic in the swirling mist<br>
A silent witness - me.<br>
<br>
Suddenly I saw Her<br>
A photo on a poster on a gable wall<br>
Each time I passed I was captivated, entranced<br>
Inexorably drawn to Her face, attention in enthrall.<br>
<br>
She is Vishwarupa, She contains the universe<br>
Thus, it was easy for Her<br>
To help us take the next evolutionary step,<br>
To become the spirit.<br>
<br>
I didn't know it at the time, how could I?<br>
Nor did the hundreds or so who saw the poster too.<br>
She called, I came, a minority of one.<br>
Non duality connected to the One.<br>
<br>
What did I have, worth holding on to?<br>
Touching Her Lotus Feet<br>
Surrender was sweet, revealing<br>
Just as the morning mist conceals, and gives way to light.<br>
</p>
