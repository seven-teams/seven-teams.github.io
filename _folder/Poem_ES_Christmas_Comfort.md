<p>
What would you do if you were two,<br>
(You couldn't even tie your shoe)<br>
And you woke up that Christmas day<br>
To find yourself in piles of hay?<br>
<br>
Then, looking all around, you see<br>
That you are not where you should be;<br>
Not home in bed, so clean and warm,<br>
But in a little cow/sheep barn.<br>
<br>
Still in your pyjamas, you<br>
Jump up when you hear moo-oo.<br>
Then you see a mouse run by,<br>
Rushing so, you wonder why.<br>
<br>
Then you see the animals are<br>
Gathering near a shining star<br>
And you wonder how a star<br>
Came so far into this barn.<br>
<br>
So you walk so quietly<br>
Through the hay so you can see<br>
What they all are looking at,<br>
Cow and lamb and mouse and cat.<br>
<br>
When you get there, you push through,<br>
Past the silent animals, who<br>
Let you pass to see that Thing<br>
That makes you want to laugh and sing!<br>
<br>
"Oh, so sweet!" you sigh, as grace,<br>
Glowing from the sunny Face<br>
Of that Baby lying there,<br>
Fills your heart with cool, fresh air.<br>
<br>
In His giggle, you feel joy,<br>
Enough for every girl and boy.<br>
And when He kicks His tiny Feet,<br>
You feel that love is now complete.<br>
<br>
Just when you feel you've had your fill<br>
The whole, wide world gets brighter still<br>
As two soft and graceful Arms<br>
Hold you - keep you safe from harm.<br>
<br>
You look up and see the Smile<br>
That seems to stretch for mile upon mile;<br>
That Smile that lights the moon and sun,<br>
And gives life to everyone.<br>
<br>
And there in <font color="red">Mother</font>'s lap you sleep<br>
And know the promise She will keep,<br>
That Her Son spoke clear and true,<br>
To come as <font color="red">Comforter</font> to you.<br>
