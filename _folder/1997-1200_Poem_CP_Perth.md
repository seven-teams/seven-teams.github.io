<p>
You know we need not worry<br>
You know we need not cry<br>
Because our Mother loves us<br>
All we need to do is try -<br>
<br>
Try to give our love to others<br>
Try to keep ourselves clear<br>
As long as we help one another<br>
There is nothing to fear<br>
<br>
So try to spread our Mothers word<br>
and for thy comfort know<br>
Our Mother will always protect us<br>
In her Divine Love we shall grow<br>
</p>
