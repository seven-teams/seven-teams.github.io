<br>

<p>
In this narrow bed, I lie<br>
attempting the patience of a shell<br>
that catches light and sound<br>
but makes no move, by no effort of its own<br>
stranded on the sand.<br>
I hear what comes:<br>
traffic like water.<br>
small birds chattering,<br>
the dove that asks 'Where's Father?'<br>
over and again.<br>
Footsteps and pieces<br>
of private conversation,<br>
comforting as random stones<br>
picked up and pocketed.<br>
What comes is welcome, outside control â€“<br>
Casual, miraculous.<br>
As if I had been deaf<br>
and now may hear<br>
only what is fresh,<br>
the purest gift.<br>
</p>
