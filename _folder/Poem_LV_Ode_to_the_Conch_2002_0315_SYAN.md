<p>
O Conch.
You form of perfection<br>
Who could imitate you?<br>
<br>
Only inside us<br>
There is an echo<br>
Of that spiral form<br>
Sounding forth that OM,<br>
Winding through our lives<br>
In this unwitting world<br>
Which has forgotten<br>
That note of quietude<br>
Or the power of your song<br>
Born in the dawn of creation when<br>
Lord Siva<br>
Gently pushed His Shakti forth<br>
And in Her whirling dance<br>
The Innocence was formed<br>
On your long winding note.<br>
<br>
We now can hear again<br>
That pure untempered sound.<br>
And can imagine how<br>
When Durga raised you to Her lips<br>
And blew divine breath through you<br>
What dismay you brought<br>
Her foes then In that swelling roar of sound<br>
Having no hollow within themselves<br>
They could not bear it.<br>
<br>
And now we widen chambers in our hearts<br>
In stillness to receive and send<br>
Your golden caul of sound<br>
Throughout the universe<br>
At perfect pitch of praise.<br>
</p>
