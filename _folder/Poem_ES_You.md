<br>

<p>
Beyond the windows of your eyes,<br>
Your soul abides in sunny skies,<br>
Bathing in the light of love<br>
That pours down sweetly from above.<br>
<br>
That is the way it's supposed to be<br>
When a soul is dear and free,<br>
But on the unmapped sea of life<br>
Inner storms bring pain and strife.<br>
<br>
High above each storm, a star<br>
Shines to show you who you are:<br>
Not this head and not this hand;<br>
Not the owner of this land;<br>
<br>
Not this angry shrunken heart<br>
Feeling like it's torn apart;<br>
Not the one whose thoughts bring noise<br>
Never knowing peace or joy;<br>
<br>
Not the child that fears the night;<br>
Not the man that wants to fight;<br>
Not the woman, alone and sad;<br>
Not those thousand dreams gone bad.<br>
<br>
High inside, but within reach,<br>
There waits a pristine, sunlit beach,<br>
That graceful shore of your own spirit<br>
Listen now, and you will hear it.<br>
<br>
Open your hands and feel your breeze<br>
That softly blows through inner trees,<br>
In the Country that's your own<br>
Where seeds of happiness are sown.<br>
<br>
It's only just a breath away.<br>
Once you reach here, you will stay;<br>
For here is where your life will start;<br>
And soul and joy will never part.<br>
</p>
