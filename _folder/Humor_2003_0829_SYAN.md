1. We're related.<br>
2. God knew she likes me a lot more than other people's moms like me.<br>
<br>
<b>What ingredients are mothers made of?</b><br>
1. God makes mothers out of clouds and angel hair and everything nice in the world and one dab of mean.<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

2. She got too old to do anything else with him.<br>
3. My grandma says that mom didn't have her thinking cap on.<br>
<br>
<b>What makes a real woman?</b><br>
1. It means you have to be really bossy without looking bossy.<br><br>
<br><br>
<br>
<b>Who's the boss at your house?</b><br>
1. Mom doesn't want to be boss, but she has to because dads such a goofball.<br>
2. Mom. You can tell by room inspection. She sees the stuff under the bed.<br>
3. I guess Mom is, but only because she has a lot more to do than dad.<br>
<br>
<b>What's the difference between moms and dads?</b><br>
1. Moms work at work and work at home, and dads just got to work at work.<br>
2. Moms know how to talk to teachers without scaring them.<br>
3. Dads are taller and stronger, but moms have all the real power 'cause that's who you gotta ask if you want to sleep over at your friend's.<br>
<br>

<br>
<b>What's the difference between moms and grandmas?</b><br>

2. You can always count on grandmothers for candy. Sometimes moms don't even have bread on them!<br>
<br>
<b>Describe the world's greatest mom?</b><br>

2. Her casserole recipes. But we hate them.<br>
3. Just her children.<br>
<br>
<b>What would it take to make your mom perfect?</b><br>
1. On the inside she's already perfect. Outside, I think some kind of plastic surgery.<br>
2. Diet. You know, her hair. I'd dyeâ€”it, maybe blue.<br>
<br>
<b>If you could change one thing about your mom, what would it be?</b><br>
1. She has this weird thing about me keeping my room clean. I'd get rid of that.<br>
2. I'd make my mom smarter. Then she would know it was my sister who did it and not me.
