<p>
We have sought the fight,<br>
SAHAJA is right,<br>
Our MOTHER SHRI MATAJI<br>
has helped us to see,<br>
What is wrong and what is right.<br>
<br>
We should have no fear,<br>
Our MOTHER is here,<br>
The truth is sought,<br>
The battle is being fought.<br>
<br>
It is everywhere budding,<br>
SAHAJ YOGA is spreading,<br>
Earlier people were materialized [materialistic],<br>
But now they are becoming self realized.<br>
<br>
Those Who are blind,<br>
Can now see and find,<br>
The truth unveiled by our MOTHER,<br>
By uniting the whole world  together.<br>
<br>
HOLY MOTHER we can never repay,<br>
For taking our negativities away. 
</p>
