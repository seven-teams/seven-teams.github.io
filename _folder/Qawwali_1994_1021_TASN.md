<p>
In Kali Yuga - when the world was covered in darkness....<br>
The greatest incarnation wished to take Her birth upon this Earth ....<br>
Her Name is Adi Shakti Mataji<br>
Shri Nirmala Devi - Shri Mataji!<br>
<br>
You came upon this Earth with Your Lotus Feet which are very beautiful.<br>
Your Feet are worshiped by the Saints and Gods - throughout the times.<br>
Wherever You go people are transformed at once through Your Lotus Feet,<br>
I'm asking for devotion to Your Lotus Feet - Shri Adi Shakti!<br>

Sweet and tender are the Lotus Feet of Shri Adi Shakti.<br>
Loving, almighty - Your Feet are the refuge of my heart.<br>
May I be dissolved in the amrut flowing from Your Lotus Feet.<br>
I'm asking for devotion to Your Lotus Feet - Shri Adi Shakti!<br>
<br>
The flowers have only one desire - to decorate Your Feet.<br>
Mother please awaken within us the desire - to be at Your Feet.<br>
We are lost without the blessings flowing - from Your Lotus Feet.<br>
I'm asking for devotion to Your Lotus Feet - Shri Adi Shakti!<br>
<br>
The radiance of Shri Mataii's feet is more dazzling than the sun.<br>
Darkness only is dispelled by the feet of Shri Mataji.<br>
The Lotus Feet of Adi Shakti.<br>
The Feet of Nirmala - Shri Mataji - Devi - Jai!<br>
<br> 
Many lives we spent to fulfill our purpose of seeking.<br>
Many were the mistakes and errors we made in the quest of Truth.<br>
We were almost lost - but now we have arrived at Your Lotus feet.<br>
I'm asking for devotion to Your Lotus Feet - Shri Adi Shakti!<br>
<br>
You grant us the worship of Your Feet in the Puja's - in Cabella.<br>
The honey and the milk - the kumkum, flowers - we put on Your Feet.<br>
The nectar flowing from Your Feet (is) desired - by all the Gods.<br>
I'm asking for devotion to Your Lotus Feet Shri Adi Shakti!<br>
<br>
At the sight of Your feet, gone is my ego and pride.<br>
At the sight of Your feet, tears of bliss in my heart.<br>
The loving Feet of Adi Shakti.<br>
The Feet of Nirmala - Shri Mataji - Devi - Jai!<br>
<br> 
Vibrations are flowing from Your Lotus Feet - it is only Your Love.<br>
This Love is flooding the universe - and melting our hearts.<br>
We thank You Mother for having come - with Loving Lotus Feet<br>
I'm asking for devotion to Your Lotus Feet - Shri Adi Shakti!<br>
<br>
Mother's Feet cannot be compared with diamonds, pearls and gold.<br>
The beauty of Her feet makes us mad with Love - and sing Her praise.<br>
When we sing Quawali oh Mother we're lost in devotion to You.<br>
I'm asking for devotion to Your Lotus Feet Shri Adi Shakti!<br>
<br>
Through the power of Your Feet - now we are Sahaja Yogi's.<br>
Now we are lost in Your Love - please guide us ever more.<br>
The Lotus Feet of Adi Shakti.<br>
The Feet of Nirmala Shri Mataji - Devi -Jai!
