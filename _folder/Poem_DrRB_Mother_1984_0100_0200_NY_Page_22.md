<p>
My Mother has the radiance of the Sun and the Moon,<br>
&nbsp;&emsp;and Her eyes are the glory of the Universe.<br>
Her diadem is set with the Sun, the Moon & Stars<br>
&nbsp;&emsp;and Her crown is ablaze with cosmic Love & Purity.<br>
Her ornaments are the devotions of Her children<br>
&nbsp;&emsp;and She is the supreme Ishwari, the Parameshwari - of all that is.<br>
She is the source flood of humankind<br>
&nbsp;&emsp;and the source flood of all existence.<br>
From Her feet humankind takes birth and all the universes their existence<br>
&nbsp;&emsp;She is the source of all that is, and bliss transcending all experience<br>
From Her Nabhi flows auspiciousness in a divine milky flood.<br>
&nbsp;&emsp;From Her heart flows auspiciousness in hot fierce and protecting blood<br>
Surrounding to protect Her own, raised to pinnacles unknown<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and heights beyond all others.<br>
She is the sources of all devotion, of prayer and virtuous acts.<br>
&nbsp;&emsp;She is the poetry of the soul, its light and comprehension,<br>
She is awareness of the earth, She of cosmic second birth<br>
&nbsp;&emsp;Of virtue, liberation and the end; eternal unbroken and without end.<br>
Her throat is like a pale blue star - in which is held the cosmic sound<br>
&nbsp;&emsp;Light and protection from the fumes of hell; and cosmic poison's futile wrath.<br>
Within it divine souls take birth and angels praise in cosmic dance-<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;their divine all-embracing Lord,<br>
But She alone is above it all, and in sweet playfulness holds it tight.<br>
&nbsp;&emsp;Her forehead is smooth and clear, radiant like the snowy mountain's brow.<br>
Ablaze with cosmic light and love-pure compassion's eternal birth;<br>
&nbsp;&emsp;Ablaze with the crest of supreme worth, arranged to set the worlds to right,<br>
Culminating in a snowy cap, the liberation of countless earths.<br>
Beyond it, above, Her being ascends,<br>
&nbsp;&emsp;Cosmic eternal all-embracing.<br>
Without form yet always there,<br>
&nbsp;&emsp;The universe's unimaginable light.<br>
Beyond meaning, beyoud thought -<br>
&nbsp;&emsp;beyond the Gunas, and all matter,<br>
There She exists, the eternal Lord,<br>
&nbsp;&emsp;Parabrahma without end.<br>
When this heart of mind beholds Her -<br> 
&nbsp;&emsp;automatically of itself gets up;<br>
And playing with the fingers of its own desire -<br>
&nbsp;&emsp;on the strings of its cosmic love<br>
Singing of its pure existence and its devotion's unending flood,<br>
&nbsp;&emsp;uncontrollable sings on, hymns of radiance joy and love, devotion inexpressible<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and radiant -<br>
At seeing its Mother's eternal worth; and seeing its Mother's eternal Love.<br>
