<p>
On the last night of September '81<br>
A night that few witnessed, few recall,<br>
She declared in Christ Church, Manhattan<br>
That She was the living God<br>
<br>
“Today, I declare that I am the Holy Ghost!<br>
I am the Holy Spirit<br>
Who has incarnated on this Earth<br>
For your realization.”<br>
<br>
Someone said, “Mother, I love you.”<br>
She was unconcerned for if you recognize<br>
How could you not love Her?<br>
She was more concerned that we love each other<br>
As much as She loves each and every one of us.<br>
<br>
In this church, named after Jesus<br>
Who gave this commandment<br>
“That ye love one another; as I have loved you,<br>
That ye also love one another.”<br>
<br>
There it was, the Manhattan Declaration<br>
Harnessing the power of the Hamsa in the Vishhudhi<br>
The 16,000 aspects of Americeshwari<br>
To put it out there.<br>
</p>
