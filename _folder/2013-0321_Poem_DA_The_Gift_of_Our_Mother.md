<p>
You picked up love<br>
And put it into my hands<br>
I held it as an obstacle<br>
To my thoughts<br>
I was one of the empty barrels<br>
I made lots of sounds<br>
Love that you poured into me<br>
Filled my hallows<br>
The sounds died<br>
Or should I say, “had no space to live”<br>
You filled me<br>
As the Flutist fills the flute<br>
You reaped what you sowed<br>
I was your fruit and you loved me<br>
I was the music that penetrated your ears<br>
Filling your heart with love<br>
You loved, and I became your love<br>
That was my hidden potential.<br>
</p>
