<p>
Once I went to a circus,<br>
To work and spend my life,<br>
But after I joined the circus,<br>
did not know how to spend my time.<br>
<br>
In the morning I saw,<br>
A monkey on the bar,<br>
So I picked him up with all my strength,<br>
And threw him very far.<br>
<br>
Then a big fat elephant,<br>
Came and broke my trunk,<br>
But after a while I noticed,<br>
That someone made him drunk.<br>
<br>
Then came a cheetah,<br>
And climbed up a tree,<br>
And as soon as I walked past,<br>
He jumped straight on me.<br>
<br>
I was terrified badly,<br>
And didn't know what to do,<br>
So I ran away from the circus,<br>
And had a very bad flu.<br>
<br>
And now I miss the circus,<br>
In which I had lots of fun,<br>
except 1 had a bit of trouble,<br>
And didn't get to see the evening sun.
