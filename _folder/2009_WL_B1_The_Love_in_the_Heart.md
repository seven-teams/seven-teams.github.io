<p style="text-align:center;">
The love in the heart<br>
<br>
With depth in understanding<br>
Teaching without talking<br>
Feeling without sensation<br>
Knowing without reaction<br>
<br>
The love in the heart is patient<br>
Longing to flow without a thought<br>
Longing to care without fear<br>
of being misunderstood<br>
<br>
The love in the heart is patient<br>
At times down to a trickle like a river in the summer<br>
At times swelling to a stream like a river in the spring<br>
It knows the Mother is the source that keeps it alive<br>
While we learn to express the joy of being one
