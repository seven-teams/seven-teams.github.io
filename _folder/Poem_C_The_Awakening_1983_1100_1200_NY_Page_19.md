<p>
Woken from a night of dreams<br>
&emsp; Of dread fear and uncertainty<br>
And sprinkled far and few between<br>
&emsp; vague glimpses of reality,<br>
As shadows flee and draw away<br>
&emsp; I open up my eyes to see,<br>
With selfless love and gentle care<br>
&emsp; A Longed-for Face bends over me.<br>
Then slowly recognition grows<br>
&emsp; Of She for whom I've ever sought,<br>
And follows bliss and grace untold<br>
&emsp; And joys of which I had dreamt not.<br>
Continues with increasing strength<br>
&emsp; the reunion started on that day,<br>
And songs are sung with loudening voice<br>
&emsp; which chase all sleep and doubt away.<br>
On high a Blessed Flower unfolds,<br>
&emsp; the light grows as it further blooms;<br>
Faces upturned towards the truth<br>
&emsp; rejoice to behold the doom of Doom.<br>
The Fair Mother whose unfading voice<br>
&emsp; awakened me with gentle calls<br>
Ascends with power and majesty:<br>
&emsp; The Ageless Goddess, the Source of All.<br>
She takes Her seat above that Flower<br>
&emsp; whose center forms a throne of gold,<br>
And reveals to all the Age of Truth;<br>
&emsp; Through consciousness and bliss--behold!<br>
</p>
