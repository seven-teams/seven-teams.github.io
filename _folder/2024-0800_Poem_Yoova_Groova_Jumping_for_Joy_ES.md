<p>
The Yuva Groov-ah!<br>
(a jungle-rap)<br>

<br>
Inthe late twen-tee-ith century<br>
We took our births—came round to see<br>
What kind of things were goin’ down<br>
Since we were here last time around.<br>
<br>
We landed in the middle of<br>
Ghor-kaliyug, where precious love<br>
Was just a word in countless songs,<br>
It’s divine meaning lost and gone.<br>

It seemed the world stood on its head,
And bad was good, and good was dead,
And Innocence had been kidnapped,
And Decency, stabbed in the back.
<br>
YOOva, yOOva, KEEP me in the groov-ah!<br>
ShAkti, shAkti, FILL me up with bhakti!<br>
Got to get the world back<br>
On the cool, auspicious track!<br>
<br>
But very much to our surprise,<br>
As we began to op’n our eyes,<br>
We realized our lucky fate—<br>
Vibrations flowed and life was great!<br>
<br>
We breathed a cool, enlightened air<br>
That filled our hearts and made us care.<br>
The shadows of mankind seemed small<br>
Compared to this compassionate All.<br>
<br>
When we looked up, the truth was clear,<br>
Our Divine Mother waited here<br>
For us to grow and leave Her mark<br>
In every single human heart.<br>
<br>
YOOva, yOOva, KEEP me in the groov-ah!<br>
ShAkti, shAkti, FILL me up with bhakti!<br>
Got to get the world back<br>
On the cool, auspicious track!<br>
<br>
The odds were high, the task was great.<br>
Now there’s no time to hesitate.<br>
Shri Mataji has op'ned us up<br>
So we can fill up every cup.<br>
<br>
We’re gathered here at the nick of time<br>
To free the world and stop the crime.<br>
The people stop, they op’n their hands,<br>
And then they start to understand.<br>
<br>
Many at first, could not believe<br>
That so much Love from heaven could stream.<br>
It’s easy with this wideband thing<br>
Called Kundalini Awakening—<br>
<br>
And that is why we gotta sing:<br>
<br>
YOOva, yOOva, KEEP me in the groov-ah!<br>
ShAkti, shAkti, FILL me up with bhakti!<br>
Got to get the world back<br>
On the cool, auspicious track!<br>
<br>
YOOva, yOOva, KEEP me in the groov-ah!<br>
ShAkti, shAkti, FILL me up with bhakti!<br>
Got to get the world back<br>
On the cool, auspicious track!</p>
