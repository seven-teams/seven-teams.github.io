<p>
The earth is in meditation,<br>
rock sure between what passes,<br>
girt with sea and river.<br>
Mountains are its power,<br>
immoveable, their heads like lions'<br>
thrust into sun, storm, cloud.<br>
<br>
Effortless, the antelope<br>
bounds up the slope,<br>
Arrow-swift, graceful, it too<br>
is in meditation, being mostly dearly<br>
itself, unaware of otherness,<br>
intent with life and joy<br>
in the paradise of now.<br>
</p>
