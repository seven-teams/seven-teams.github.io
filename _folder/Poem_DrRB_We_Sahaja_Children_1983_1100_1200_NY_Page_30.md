<br>

<p>
From the first wave that gave us birth, resounding through the universe,<br>
From the first sound we were born, to reverberate through the resounding world.<br>
<br>
Of father's eternal auspiciousness and Mother's joyous love and innocence,<br>
Of spontaneous play and freedom dance, of eternal longing we were born.<br>
<br>
To give meaning to sanctity, to return essence to sacredness,<br>
To give vein to joyous song and mirth, and flow in freedom throughout the earth.<br>
<br>
For of our Mother's womb we were born, and once more from Her crowned head,<br>
And in both were unctuous joy and love, and immaculate glory overspread.<br>
<br>
Like a fabric She takes the cosmic sounds, rends and from the rents give forth,<br>
Eterna' sounds that dance like men, and to eternal glory return again.<br>
<br>
Like bees round nectar drinking deeply, soul deep round the sacred cup,<br>
In sacred innocents cheerful shouting, crowd thick around their Mother's lap.<br>
<br>
Like lotuses waving in the wind, each one filled with sacred strands,<br>
And bowing to each lotus head with wings outspread, filling deep their lotus hands.<br>
<br>
Lotus like born of loving softness, returning softness born of love,<br>
Each one filled joyously resounding, the softness of the eternal word.<br>
<br>
Each with sacred love cascading, each with love sacred overflowing,<br>
Each to cosmic love surrendering, Eternal lost in eternal love.<br>
<br>
Each child longs to meet its Mother, drowned in Her fulfilling love,<br>
Each one longs to peal with laughter, and pour his love into the flood.<br>
<br>
Each one pouring with reverence flowing, the glory that is of his birthright,<br>
Each in glory deep entwining drawing, the threads of eternal union tight.<br>
<br>
Each one brother to the other, sister to each others love,<br>
Proving in their close communion, the boundless limits of their Mother's love.<br>
<br>
Embraced in the all encompassing, filled with the all pervading,<br>
Swimming in the all-containing, dissolving in the all sustaining.<br>
AMEN<br>
