<p>
I am Ganesha and I love all the earth.<br>
For I am the lord of the Virgin birth.<br>
I danced in the morning when the world began.<br>
And I danced when they crucified me as man.<br>
I love all mankindâ€”and for it to be free<br>
I love it to grow as straight as a tree,<br>
I love my Mother and I love Her work,<br>
I love Her hands and I love Her Feet.<br>
All mankind is within me and I long for my body to be free.<br>
I love the work of my creator Father -<br>
And I love the joy of my awesome Mother -<br>
I love mankind but they don't love me -<br>
For they feared and they hid and were not free.<br>
For in original sin, they chose to be free<br>
To hurt and destroy, and not love me.<br>
But I am the lover of the Universe,<br>
And I forgive it again and again -<br>
And I soothe their hurts and long for their pain<br>
To be gone for ever, and for them again<br>
To love each other and to be pure -<br>
And enjoy my Parents' eternal store<br>
To live in Paradise eternally<br>
And, as my brothers<br>
And sisters, always to love me.<br>
For I am Lord of the dance, said he.<br>
