<p>
Feel the call of Love within your soul<br>
Walk across the world in each direction<br>
Try to bring the peace to every home<br>
And to turn into friends the fighting nations<br>
Once you melt your heart in Joy of Spirit<br>
Then in any land you'll always find:<br>
People are so caring, nice and friendly,<br>
And the earth is generous and kind!<br>
<br>
<b>Chorus:</b><br>
Believe your heart, believe your soul -<br>
The Truth is one, the World is whole!<br>
God's Grace is beyond the creed and race,<br>
God's Love wants the whole World embrace:<br>
On your palms feel the cool breeze:<br>
It is thine, this gift of Divine!<br>
<br>
<b>Repeat:</b><br>
Believe your heart, believe your soul -<br>
The Truth is one, the World is whole!<br>
My friend, all the wars will come to end<br>
My friend, Truth and Love will always stand:<br>
On your palms feel the cool breeze:<br>
It is thine, this gift of Divine!<br>
<br>
When the whole world will come together,<br>
When the whole earth will get united,<br>
Sea and Sky will memorize forever<br>
Laughter and Joy of brothers reunited.<br>
In the light of self-realization<br>
From within the righteousness we'll know<br>
And completely new civilization<br>
On the shores of Mother Earth will grow.<br>
<br>
<b>Chorus:</b><br>
Believe your heart, believe your soul -<br>
The Truth is one, the World is whole!<br>
God's Grace is beyond the creed and race,<br>
God's Love wants the whole World embrace:<br>
On your palms feel the cool breeze:<br>
It is thine, this gift of Divine!<br>
<br>
<b>Repeat:</b><br>
Believe your heart, believe your soul -<br>
The Truth is one, the World is whole!<br>
My friend, all the wars will come to end<br>
My friend, Truth and Love will always stand:<br>
On your palms feel the cool breeze:<br>
It is thine, this gift of Divine!<br>
