<p>
In the rain of little drops I see the face of the moon shining like pearls here and there. I hear these raindrops singing on roof tops in a joyful way. I feel like a fairy and I am flying with the birds in the sky. Nothing stops me nor the birds whether there is thunder or a storm, snow or rain, sun or moon it is all the same. We fly together, high, above the world and walk on rainbows over the mountains singing songs of joy and life.<br>
<br> 
With the dangling sound raindrops come, mother earths opens a big pot and collects them in that. She hides them in her lap and then suddenly she gives them to the plants to grow higher and  higher then I grow with flowers, plants and trees, and swing with the air to sprinkle the fragrance and peace everywhere.
