<p style="text-align:center;">
Deep inside of me, there is a lake<br>
It is still, reflecting a mountain like a mirror<br>
My mind is silent when I look at it<br>
<br>
There, a ripple seems to distort the reflection<br>
It is not disturbing<br>
But spreads a wave of joy throughout my body<br>
<br>
Silence sets back in again<br>
The lake seems immeasurably deep<br>
The reflection of the mountain unimaginably pure<br>
</p>
