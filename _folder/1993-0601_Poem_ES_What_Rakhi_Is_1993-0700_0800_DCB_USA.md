<b>Daddy, what is Rakhi?</b><br>
<b>Does it come with Santa Claus?</b><br>
Rakhi is the sweetest gift,<br>
It twinkles in the stars.<br>
It wakes the world with lightning<br>
And puts an end to wars.<br>
<br>
<b>Does it grow in summer?</b><br>
<b>Is it very big or small?</b><br>
Rakhi is a bond of love,<br>
It nourishes the trees.<br>
It is the timeless border<br>
Where the mountains meet the seas.<br>
<br>
<b>Is it in the kitchen?</b><br>
<b>Does it taste like lemonade?</b><br>
Rakhi quenches every thirst<br>
And rids the heart of lust.<br>
Respect is its foundation,<br>
Its furniture is Trust.<br>
<br>
<b>...Mommy, what is Rakhi?</b><br>
<b>(I don't think Daddy knows.)</b><br>
Rakhi is a little string<br>
That's given once a year<br>
From sisters to their brothers<br>
To show their love and care.<br>
<br>
<b>What's so special, Mama,</b><br>
<b>About something like a string?</b><br>
It's not the string that's special<br>
But the pure feelings that come<br>
When Vishnumaya's power<br>
Makes their hearts beat like one drum.<br>
<br>
<b>It would make nice music</b><br>
<b>If we all could tie this string!</b><br>
Someday the world will know this,<br>
Then everyone will see<br>
What Rakhi is and why it<br>
Is the bond that sets us free.
