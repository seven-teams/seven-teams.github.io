<p>
Please make me the detached witness to your divine play<br>
Please make me the detached witness to your divine play<br>
<br>
Let me know that aspect of Brahman in me<br>
Let it merge into Parabrahman<br>
And know that Brahman, Parabrahman and Kundalini<br>
Are all three aspects of Shri Mataji,<br>
<br>
She told me, taught me, showed me<br>
And the buddhi which understood,<br>
The heart that supports that experience,<br>
All these are again Shri Mataji Herself.<br>
<br>
Nothing else is important.<br>
Everything is myth! Doesn't exist.<br>
Like a dream in deep sleep<br>
Like a dream in deep sleep<br>
<br>
Or as when the power fails,<br>
While watching a favorite movie,<br>
When fully engaged with the characters and the script.<br>
Even a speck of ego entertaining the idea that we know what Maya is, is dangerous.<br>
<br>
Hence the prayer is:<br>
â€œShri Mataji, Please bless us with the faith and surrender, so we are kept safe in You and can witness in detachment everything around,<br>
Till retained in this temple of Your's (that's in this body).<br>
