<p>
How can one describe the royal eternal?<br>
Shri Raja Laxshmi, pink and generous,<br>
Resting on your elbow,<br>
Being fanned and cooling us,<br>
Gold and deep pink,<br>
Fragrance.<br>
<br>
Knowing and absolute attention,<br>
Humble, supreme among the lights,<br>
Loving sweetly the gifts,<br>
Smiling and trying the pink diamond on.<br>
<br>
Allowing us to be near and to give what is Hers,<br>
To demonstrate, express wealth that comes from Her.<br>
Permission and aid to take us evolving<br>
&emsp;&emsp;on the Mahalaxshmi principle,<br>
To meet Your Lord in silence,<br>
Complete at Sahasrara,<br>
Satisfied.<br>
</p>
