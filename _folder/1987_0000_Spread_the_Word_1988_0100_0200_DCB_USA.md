<p>
<b>Chorus:</b> Come my dear sister and hold out your hands,<br>
And feel the cool breezes that blow across the land.<br>
The body of spirit is awakening within,<br>
To stop all our anger and lead us from sin.<br>
Spread the word: God has come to us again.<br>
Born on the Earth, inviting Her children to ascend.<br>
<br>
The age of darkness is to be expelled.<br>
We've lived in it too long, we're now through with Hell.<br>
We ask for her purity to wash out our soul.<br>
Evolution to spirit becomes now our goal.<br>
<br>
<b>Chorus</b><br>
<br>
She is God the Mother with this human birth.<br>
She teaches us freedom and true human worth.<br>
Awakens our powers to know what is right<br>
And gives inner knowledge and the inner tight.<br>
<br>
<b>Chorus</b><br>
<br>
Humbly we pray that you stay for a while<br>
So that we may enjoy your sweet divine smile.<br>
To be in your presence washes us clean.<br>
It's more than we've hoped for, it's more than our dreams.<br>
<br>
<b>Chorus</b>
</p>
