<p>
Your heart is opened if you can be<br>
with anybody without judging<br>
Your heart is opened if you just can<br>
be a witness to anybody's act<br>
Your heart is opened if you are joyful<br>
by the sight of the joyfulness of<br>
others<br>
Your heart is opened if you feel love<br>
and compassion from this heart<br>
Your heart is opened if you listen not<br>
to the voice of your mind but to<br>
the one of your heart<br>
Your heart is opened if it is this heart<br>
answering and not your mind<br>
and judgment<br>
Your heart is opened if you can accept<br>
anybody's imperfections<br>
and love him anyway<br>
Your heart is opened if this heart is<br>
spontaneously generous<br>
Your heart is opened if this heart<br>
make you be where you have to<br>
be, when you have to be<br>
Your heart is opened if you can give<br>
love to anybody else spontaneously<br>
Your heart is opened if when listen<br>
ing to anybody's suffering you<br>
can just be thoughtless<br>
Your heart is opened if when listen<br>
ing to anybody's suffering you<br>
feel only love and compassion<br>
Your heart is opened if when listen<br>
ing to another point of view,<br>
you stay thoughtless and loving<br>
When your heart is opened<br>
The others hear Mother's voice and<br>
not yours<br>
The others feel Mother's love and<br>
not yours<br>
The others feel Mother's compassion<br>
and not yours<br>
Everything which was yours be<br>
comes Her's when your heart is<br>
opened<br>
Everything becomes silent, you are<br>
only a witness, you become a beau-<br>
tiful instrument of the Universe's all-<br>
pervading love, whose Great Mother<br>
is Our Beloved Mother who is within<br>
and without, when your heart is<br>
opened.<br>
