<p>
Shri Bhaswarasuri, in radiance you shine.<br>
You are the Holy Ghost, all adoration Thine,<br>
Mother, You are the Devi, and demons You do slay,<br>
You protect the Devas, and those to You who pray,<br>
Creatrix of all that is, of all this Mahamaya,<br>
You guide and help all those who have spiritual desire,<br>
Transformation You have wrought. Your Chaitanya does blow.<br>
This breeze Divine does integrate all things in me. You know.<br>
In others too, I see the change, and as all things work out,<br>
I see the truth, and feel the joy, which leaves me in no doubt.<br>
That now, at ease surrendered, whole, I feel that I'm in You,<br>
I've found again my innocence, there's little left to do.<br>
Except, at times, proclaim to all, "You too can know what's true!"<br>
</p>
