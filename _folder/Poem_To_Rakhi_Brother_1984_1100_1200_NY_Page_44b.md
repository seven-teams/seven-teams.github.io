<p>
Dear brother, accept this endless love,<br>
for which I am, but a channel,<br>
As a sister, allow me,<br>
to lighten your burdens,<br>
express this joy, creative and prospering,<br>
So solid, sublime, yet frank,<br>
So Powerful, lovely and soothing,<br>
This eternal Shakti swells<br>
Desiring to share, to serve<br>
spreding fragrant smell.<br>
We shall break the superficial bond,<br>
Collectively get united.<br>
As our Vishuddhis blossom.<br>
Man, in his evolution softens,<br>
May our love for one another broaden,<br>
gaining subtler ways of exploring,<br>
This Sahaja family love,<br>
of brother and sister,<br>
With subtler joys start flowing<br>
With Shri Mataji's blessings,<br>
In your Presence,<br>
Dear brother so sweet,<br>
This Kundalini elevates<br>
&emsp;and dances over my head,<br>
So overjoyed is She to be,<br>
&emsp;in company of thee.<br>
Strengthened by my inner strength,<br>
bowing to the Purity.<br>
To be greeted by your smiling face,<br>
Reflecting Spirit,<br>
Enlightened Soul,<br>
Ignites a love, which few can know,<br>
And we pray.<br>
Through us it grow,<br>
This love, so humbly exists<br>
Divinity created.<br>
Deep, within,<br>
from lifetime's longing<br>
It satisfies, and quenches,<br>
a thirst for innocence and sweetness<br>
as tender as a new seed planted.<br>
</p>
