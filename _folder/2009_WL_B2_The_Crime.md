<p style="text-align:center;">
How can we forgive a crime<br>
so heinous that it might affect<br>
our lives for generations?<br>
So atrocious that it might never<br>
leave our minds at peace?<br>
<br>
Maybe if we realize that the purpose of it was<br>
that it should haunt us<br>
<br>
Maybe if we realize that the evil that caused it<br>
is working now through us<br>
The same way it worked through the ones<br>
who have committed it<br>
<br>
The evil is not interested in a person or a crime<br>
<br>
It is just interested in the effect it has<br>
It only wants to destroy, to disrupt,<br>
and to maximize the length of suffering<br>
<br>
By forgiving we destroy the evil<br>
By healing we overcome the suffering<br>
<br>
By slowly opening our heart for new experiences<br>
<br>
We are creating new memories<br>
that override the past<br>
New emotions are finding ways<br>
to fill the void<br>
<br>
Love creates a creek,<br>
then a river, and then a stream<br>
Washing away the pain<br>
and filling an ocean of compassion<br>
<br>
We are strong beyond measure<br>
when we defeat the evil<br>
by forgiving the ones who committed it<br>
<br>
And by forgiving ourselves
