<p>
Some are awake though it's still dark<br>
&emsp;&emsp;They wander round, some bleary eyed<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As those just roused from millenia long sleep<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Whilst others sleep on regardless.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Not even knowing that they slumber.<br>
<br>
There are those, but few, who have always been awake;<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Who can do naught but watch wisely from the peaks<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;While on the stage the new actors stumble<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;With the weight of little understood insight<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In the valleys it is still dark<br>
<br>
Not the rustle of a leaf or the twitter of a bird -<br>
&emsp;&emsp;The deep black grey of 6000 year night<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;wreaks its weight on the human spirit<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;as it moans wretchedly beneath the load<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;of insufferable indignity<br>
<br>
But high on the mountain tops it's already quite light<br>
&emsp;&emsp;and a distinct glow is seen in the east<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Here on these few high spots<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;the night is already a bad memory<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;an illusion that evaporates as mist with new day<br>
<br>
Here you can see everything clearly as crystal<br>
&emsp;&emsp;in the incomparable brilliance of the dawn<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Here, how can you lie or deceive<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Here, it is obvious, plain, even blatant<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;How could fear or corruption survive the glare!<br>
<br>
The Angels take positions in crystal glass<br>
&emsp;&emsp;galleries of multi-rainbow hue<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;painting the infinite blue backdrop<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;with glittering festoon<br>
<br>
Up here it will always be daylight<br>
&emsp;&emsp;But down there it will not much longer be night.<br>
</p>
