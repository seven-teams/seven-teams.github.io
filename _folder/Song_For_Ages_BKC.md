<br>

<p>
For ages ... we searched for the Mother,<br>
In many incarnations and foreign lands ....<br>
Now! You hast raised our Kundalini<br>
Now! We know that we are free ....<br>
<br>
<b>Chorus</b><br>
Oh Mataji .... Nirmala Devi .....<br>
Our Hears Love flows out to Thee ....<br>
You have come from Heavens above ...<br>
To Thee ... to Thee ...our unconditional love.<br>
</p>
