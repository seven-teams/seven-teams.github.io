<p style="text-align:center;">
Sometimes I imagine<br>
a novel world for humanity<br>
I imagine a world where we all<br>
are guided by a sense of purpose<br>
<br>
I imagine humanity<br>
as part of a common being<br>
A being where each and every cell<br>
lives with freedom and with love for others<br>
A being where each and every cell<br>
is looking out for the wellbeing of the whole<br>
<br>
I imagine a world<br>
in which we live as a universal family<br>
Mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters,<br>
husband, wife, aunts and uncles<br>
all acting with a common purpose<br>
as well as with a purpose of their own<br>
<br>
My imagined world<br>
is not a world at perfect peace<br>
<br>
My sense of purpose<br>
might not always harmonize with yours<br>
They could be driving us to a road of competition<br>
Even confrontation<br>
<br>
My imagined world, though,<br>
is a world of respect for others<br>
<br>
It is a world<br>
where the elders teach the younger ones<br>
<br>
It is a world
where love acts as a guiding principle<br>
<br>
The young do not do everything that they are told<br>
They just listen and develop<br>
a sense of purpose of their own<br>
<br>
A purpose is hiding in all of us<br>
A purpose for you – A purpose for me<br>
Let’s use love as a light to find it<br>
<br>
Let’s look out for it<br>
Within
