<p>
Be you to each other<br>
As the blossom is to the tree;<br>
As colour is to the feather<br>
And as words are to the song....<br>
<br>
For a tree is still a tree without its blossom.<br>
A feather is yet a feather - be it drab.<br>
And the world is full of songs for which<br>
The, words are forgotten or not yet sung.....<br>
<br>
See you not Our Mother's hand in all of this?<br>
Surely it is Her touch that has decreed that<br>
The blossom shall add to its bough,<br>
The delicate beauty of its hue.<br>
And even as if this were not enough,<br>
The very blossom that decorates, must itself<br>
Be perfected by the addition of some sweet<br>
Scent straight from the alchemy of the Divine!<br>
<br>
Be you to each other, such as these.....<br>
May the pure love of innocence blossom amongst you;<br>
Reach out and colour your lives with bold<br>
Strokes from the divine pallet<br>
And sing you songs of comfort and concern.....<br>
For we each must needs have blossoms<br>
For our boughs; fine feathers for our wings<br>
And heavenly words for us to sing as we<br>
Journey homes.....<br>
<br>
As a mother hen is to her chicks,<br>
Be you to each other.<br>
</p>
