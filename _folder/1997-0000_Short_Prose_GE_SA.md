A few years ago, I can't remember how many, I went to a Public Programme in Vienna. SHRI MATAJI stayed for about 3 days and we had 2 Public Programmes. Quite a lot of people came, and the hall was full. Nirmal Sangeet Sarita were playing there too.<br>
I think it was the first programme, SHRI MATAJI was not there yet, and a picture was placed on her chair. It was just few minutes before Mother came, and a crazy man ran onto the stage, knocked over the chair with the picture and shouted out something to the people, which could not hear, luckily, even though I was sitting in the first row. Everyone was shocked and immediately a few strong uncles and policemen brought the man out. My heart was pounding fast and I was scared. A Sahaj Yogini put up the chair and the picture did not even have a crack! Right after that Mother came onto the stage and her smile let me forget all that had happened just then. All the shocked people were smiling now and the atmosphere was divine.<br>
After the programme, people could ask questions or come on to the stage to see SHRI MATAJI. There was a man, whose wrist was bent, SHRI MATAJI stepped onto the man's hand and asked if it hurt. He said that it didn't hurt at all. When he came off the stage the hand was not bent so much anymore and I could see clearly that he was able to move his fingers freely! Also a girl, which I knew, came on to the stage. One of my sisters told me that when the girl was small, her fingers got caught in a pressing machine and they were flattened and she could not move them properly. SHRI MATAJI took her hand and after that the girl could move her fingers as if nothing had ever happened to them!
