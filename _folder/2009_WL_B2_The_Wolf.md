<p style="text-align:center;">
A loner who enjoys the pack<br>
Playful and gentle with his peers and young<br>
<br>
Vicious, determined and persistent<br>
when pursuing his prey<br>
<br>
Longing for the eternal in the moon<br>
reflecting the sun<br>
<br>
His spirit is strong<br>
reflecting eternity in itself<br>
<br>
You will never break him with force<br>
But he will cuddle to the master’s feet<br>
when conquered with love
</p>
