<p>
I am one of the Dhauladhar Mountains. This mountain range is a part of the Himalayas. I stand much higher than sea level. It is a great experience being a mountain because it is very peaceful, blissful and enjoyable. Mother Earth has beautifully adorned me with trees, soil, rocks and small little huts here and there. When I look down at the sparkling diamond in the middle of the other mountain, I see beautiful angels enjoying themselves. Early in the fresh morning they are woken up by soft soothing music. Morning is very calm. After meditation thry follow their daily routine. In the mornings the vibrations are very strong and it seems like even I am bathing in the ocean of vibrations which our Holy Mother has bestowed upon us. Above me are superior mountains, which seem to be protecting me just like a baby is secure in its mother's lap. I am reassured by having these mountains behind me. The people who live around me are very peaceful and saintly. They are not involved in the mundane activities of life. The school looks like Shri Ganeshas's swayambhu because it is painted red. I am happy to be a mountain.<br>
