<p>
To know who you really are would be for us to realize that" We are nothing".<br>
For you being,all things means that.<br>
For us to really know that You Are love would mean that, all the love We feel ,whatever that We are capable of feeling.<br>
is merely your love reflecting off of us.<br>
And yet we are from your being, your children and you shower us and build us up you give us form and words.<br>
With these words we struggle to describe our mother. The Adi Shakti.<br>
The cycle turns ,words that were given are returned again, love becomes harmony, identities devolve the struggle to be separated becomes a beautiful event of surrender peace and placity.<br>
