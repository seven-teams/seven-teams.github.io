<p>
It means to me sweet sister, that there could hardly be<br>
A love more like our Mother's, than the one you've offered me.<br>
With face so fair and innocent, no other motives there<br>
Except, expressed right from the heart, true respect and care.<br>
<br>
I an your rakhi brother, a spiritual brother to you,<br>
And this bond between us wild last our whole life through.<br>
<br>
The giving of a gift like this, is more than I could say,<br>
You've touched me very deeply, and in a holy way,<br>
Now I'll think of you each day wherever I may go.<br>
My soul will reach across that space and try to let you know.<br>
<br>
And so today, as through the years, your face again I see,<br>
Reflecting there the grace and good that is Shri Mataji,<br>
Your sweetness and your beauty shine, inspiring me and so<br>
Thank you again sweet sister, you've helped me much to grow.<br>
<br>
And so it is, and so will be, the Golden Age this way,<br>
We know the Dharma it requires is here with us today,<br>
The flower and sweets, the perfumed oil, the Rakhi that you tie,<br>
Reminds us of the truth and love we know will never die.
</p>
