Here from the high tops where the air is like a cool breeze and the eagles fly, I see a beautiful set of castles (the school buildings) at the break of dawn. You can hear the birds chirping and lovely bhajans echoing from wall to wall of us high mountains. It's a lovely sight when all the lovely shining faces of the children appear and their laughter joins in the music. The sun comes up behind us high mountains and rays of light blend into the children's play, it keeps them warm and the flowers also start to bloom which makes the children so happy. The whole day long you can see a child enjoying nature or sitting in their own world and dreams or you can enjoy the silence when they're in their classes. But there is always a child running around playing, laughing or just sitting calmly looking into the great world. I, from up here, am never bored for it is such a delight to see them, they seem like stars shining on earth. In the evening they are all in the building and a great musical tone of bhajans arises into the air and settles the world, for the end of the day. At dusk the silence is greater but the same joy is still in the air. In the night when the moon is high above, even above me, and the stars are out, you can only hear their calm breathing or maybe a little laughter of the angels which are still awake. From up here, as a great protection for them, I sometimes wonder what they think of us.<br>
