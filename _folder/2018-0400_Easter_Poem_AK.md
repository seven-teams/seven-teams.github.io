<p>
Unwilling to accept the Cup of Praise<br>
They did not take the train to destination<br>
But wandered instead in the worldly maze<br>
Collecting wildflowers of inspiration.<br>
The garland of the lilacs will be worn<br>
By those who don't deserve the Crown of Thorns
</p>

So escaping the fame and any noise or any artificial great destination it is best to just wander collecting flowers those simple flowers of virtues and simple joys that we collect becomes our garland not the crown of thorns which we don't deserve."</list-item>
