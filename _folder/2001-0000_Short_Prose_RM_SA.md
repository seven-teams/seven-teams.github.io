If I were a tree, I wouldn't be able to think, but may be I would be able to think, but this goes according to-If I could think on my own I could have my very own thought. If I could think that would mean I had a brain. So a tree with a brain. I would think-Why do people cut us down, when our leaves exchange carbon dioxide into oxygen for them to breathe in? We even give them fruits and flowers. I would also dream of changing into a human for some time to influence other humans, to stop cutting trees, destroying beautiful gardens, picking too many flowers and when we cut one tree we should at least plant two more in its place. If any day is sunny and travelers come by and if they rest under me I would keep them cool and also give shade I would let all birds perch on me and make their nests on me. I could witness the hatching of their young ones eggs, how they come out, how they learn to fly, how they get fed by their mother, how their nest is made warm and cosy for the young ones. It would be beautiful to be a witness to everything nice. Little children would climb me, but then they would bring their fathers or uncles to hammer nails into me that I may be easier to climb and that would hurt. But still I would like having children climbing on me and birds' nests being built on me. One day I would be chopped down, and I would eventually die.
