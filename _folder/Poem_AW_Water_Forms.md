<br>

<p>
Drizzle, deceptive and subtle, soaks everything it touches,<br>
Seeps through crack and crevice,<br>
There's a sense of permanence, this could last forever.<br>
<br>
Sometimes there's a soft rain.<br>
<br>
Downpours bounce<br>
Off cement and paving slab,<br>
Splatter and splash back,<br>
Kinetic, hypnotic, repetitious beauty<br>
But no two patterns are the same.<br>
<br>
Snowfalls, flurries, irregular ornamentations on the air,<br>
Swirl earthward, not far to fall now,<br>
Will it lie?<br>
<br>
Ice, rare,<br>
Stalactites of frozen water dangle from cast iron lampposts,<br>
(Be careful, if go out you might slip and fall, say the old ones),<br>
Advice as water on a duck's back.<br>
We kids make slides in the street<br>
Steel shods on hobnail boots<br>
Stooped or on our hunkers,<br>
GlIde in the ethereal light of the gas lamps.<br>
