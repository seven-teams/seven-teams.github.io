<p>
'Twas on a dark Diwali night<br>
The darkest of the year<br>
As mankind blindly stumbled<br>
The light it did appear<br>
Omkara cast in human form<br>
Within a manger lay<br>
The Son of God, the King of Kings<br>
Was placed upon the hay.<br>
<br>
And simple men with vision clear<br>
Saw angels in the sky<br>
And left their flocks and bowed before<br>
The Holiest on High<br>
Three wise men from the East appeared<br>
With gold, incense and Myrrh<br>
And Brahma, Shiva, Vishnu bowed<br>
All Heaven was astir.<br>
<br>
Glory to God the angels sang<br>
And peace upon the earth<br>
All praise to Mahalaxmi<br>
Who gave the virgin birth<br>
May mankind learn humility<br>
As Christ within the crib<br>
And may peace reign within their hearts<br>
Let all mankind forgive.<br>
<br>
Make beds of down within your hearts<br>
And bow before the Babe<br>
And comfort him who comforts you<br>
Who came mankind to save<br>
Seek not the comfort of this Earth<br>
'Twill one day pass away<br>
That you who are the spirit may rest upon the hay.<br>
</p>
