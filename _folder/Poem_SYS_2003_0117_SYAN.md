<p>
From the 26th December<br>
We had one week to remember<br>
A group of Yuvas went to Woodford for a stay.<br>
There was a festival in town<br>
Folks came from miles around<br>
They were looking for something special to light their way.<br>
<br>
With an inkling in their heart<br>
They would find a brand new start...<br>
A spark of love that could burn as eternal flame.<br>
There were seekers and well-wishers<br>
Feeling tense and superficial<br>
At the end they could all learn about lifeâ€™s game.
<br>
First we set about the stall:<br>
We bulldog-clipped up a few walls<br>
Lots of colour and some charts so all could know...<br>
A few saris draped around<br>
Some canvas for the ground<br>
And our altar with our Mother out on show.<br>
<br>
There was plenty there to do<br>
Music and street shows: all new<br>
A program full of distractions and interactions every hour.<br>
They had poetry and plays<br>
There was Dancing and displays<br>
And in amongst it: a piece of Heaven, shining power.<br>
<br>
A vortex formed around our tent<br>
Of vibrations, Heaven sent<br>
Attracting those who sought the truth about their life.<br>
It was subtle, yet so strong<br>
That ALL who came along<br>
Felt the cool breeze, peace and love of the Divine.<br>
<br>
They wandered in, not knowing why<br>
And floated out on a new high<br>
Feeling something in their heart, before unknown<br>
The hardest of hard men<br>
Wandered out with glowing grins<br>
The seeds of light were being gently, softly sown.<br>
<br>
Seekers received the Divine flame<br>
Not knowing how or why they came<br>
Different reasons and coincidences lead them there.<br>
Hidden, masked and in disguise<br>
They wandered in with curious eyes<br>
Even men on emus were awakened, newly aware.<br>
<br>
The calmness in fresh eyes<br>
And the genuine surprise<br>
Left all who sat in witness with a smile<br>
Something special was on the rise<br>
A Love nurturing and wise<br>
Our Mother was truly flowing in tremendous style.<br>
<br>
Next year we plan for a return<br>
To give more seekers their turn<br>
At the experience that will surely change their life.<br>
They will all float on a cloud<br>
And make our Mother proud<br>
As they discover the eternal depth and truth in life.<br>
<br>
The week was a special treat<br>
Negativity suffered a huge defeat<br>
In the final count over 500 got realisation<br>
Strength and quality were the key<br>
To our Mother: Jai Shri Mataji<br>
It was a time of real joy and inspiration.<br>
