<p>
At age seventy-eight I teach myself patience in pearl-stitch on a Tunisian crochet needle.<br>
Pearl stitch because it gives a softer finish. It will be some time before I find a rhythm.<br>
I have dropped a stitch somewhere.<br>
I may have to go back - counting each row carefully<br>
But not back to the start.<br>
