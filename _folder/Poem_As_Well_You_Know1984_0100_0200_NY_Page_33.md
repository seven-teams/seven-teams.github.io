<p>
Dearest Mother, as well You know,<br>
Often within life's ebb and flow,<br>
Of up and down, the Guna's three,<br>
Struts an <i>ego</i>, it's called me<br>
Identity? Tis a balloon,<br>
That often plays an off-beat tune,<br>
And ,I caught up, think it is real,<br>
I lose the thread, vibrations feel.<br>
It's then that I stupidly dance,<br>
An awkward, manic crazy prance,<br>
Until I see that that's not me,<br>
And how l've been so-awfully.<br>
At times like these, ego's humbled.<br>
And the Self sees where it stumbled,<br>
So with Your help, yes as I grow,<br>
Til stumble less, as well You know.<br>
<br>
</p>
