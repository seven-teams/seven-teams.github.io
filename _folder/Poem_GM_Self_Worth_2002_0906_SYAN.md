<p>
I needed reflection to show me self-worth.<br>
I needed praise to measure my success.<br>
But now having the source of my self,<br>
I am the reflector of my reflection and<br>
The praise of my success.<br>
<br>
Taking the moment, O dear friend,<br>
Let me explain the Self which is my source.<br>
Seated in the lotus of the heart,<br>
Awakened by pure desire and brought to light<br>
By the Grace of the Mother’s Love.<br>
<br>
The Ancients called it by many names –<br>
Brahm, Auto, Atma, Ruh...<br>
Flowing in the centre of centres,<br>
The cool soothing winds of life<br>
<br>
Rise from the sacred triangle,<br>
Threading like pearls<br>
The various aspects of personality.<br>
The wonders of Self revealed,<br>
O dear friend, I found my self-worth.<br>
It is love unconditional, seen all around.<br>
</p>
