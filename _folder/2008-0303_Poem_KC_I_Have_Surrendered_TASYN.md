<p style="text-align:center;">
Holy Mother of my soul, complete,<br>
I have surrendered, at Your Lotus Feet,
All the hurt and all the heat,<br>
All the feelings of defeat,<br>
All the anger, all the pain,<br>
All the tension, all the strain,<br>
All the worries, all the fears,<br>
All the years of unshed tears.<br>
Oh! Shri Vishnumaya, dazzling bright,<br>
Chase away the shadows of the night.<br>
Shri Adi Guru, ancient dawning light, Take<br>
away illusion from my sight.<br>
Let the dried-up hot dead sea of strife Turn<br>
to the lush soft garden of vibrant life.<br>
Show me the way to become my own Master,<br>
How to reach my Self in the Virata.<br>
The Way is only You, Your Lotus Feet, Beloved<br>
Holy Mother, my All, Complete.<br>
</p>
