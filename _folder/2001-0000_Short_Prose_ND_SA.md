<p>
It is 2001, the millennium has started. Things are developing day by day and making us lead a more comfortable life. Man is developing these things by means of science. The Man is said to be the most brainy animal. It is not that life became comfortable just at the beginning of the new millennium. Early man had started some important inventions in the early age like invention of fire, wheel, growing of crops etc.<br>
<br>
Day by day new technology is developing for the sake of mankind only, but still science is harmful in some fields though it is useful.<br>
<br>
Factories are common inventions of science, though they produce good quality goods and give jobs to so many people, they produce smoke which gives harmful diseases.<br>
<br>
Vehicles are other examples. They save our precious time and save a lot of energy, but at the same time they pollute the environment by poisonous smoke, killing the plants and trees which produce oxygen for us to live. The smoke doesn't even leave us. It gives harmful diseases.<br>
<br>
Communication is very easy. It helps us a lot, it is true. Electronics give us recreation. But, now a days people are sticking to the television set, not taking proper care for cleanliness, listening to music at a high volume causing a lot of noise pollution which harms our ears and environment. Though science harms us a lot in some fields, it has cured many deadly diseases and helped in so many fields. But we should use science for keeping our environment in balance, and using science to help mankind, not for destruction by making atom bombs and missiles but being close to the nature and using science for welfare of our environment.
