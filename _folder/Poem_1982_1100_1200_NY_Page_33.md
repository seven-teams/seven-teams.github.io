<br>

<p>
Slow down, my busy brain, behave!<br>
It's time you changed! You're not the slave<br>
of every dark, conditioned thought<br>
that rises from the past unsought;<br>
you're not an engine shuffling facts<br>
and shaping them to future acts;<br>
nor yet a pendulum that scans<br>
the tos and fros from past to plans.<br>
<br>
Each time you swing from "what's to do"<br>
to "what's been done" you flicker through<br>
the precious present, wherein lies<br>
a glint of God's great enterprise.<br>
If we could stretch that moment where<br>
you're thoughtless, still, and yet aware,<br>
then we, my brain, might start to sense<br>
creation's vast magnificence.<br>
<br>
Oh Mother, slow my bustling brain:<br>
detach it from the brash, insane,<br>
dishonest, pampering, uncouth<br>
illusions that conceal the truth;<br>
and Mother, that I might fulfil<br>
my part of the Creator's Will,<br>
in-turn my mind and teach it how<br>
to live the ever-present Now.<br>
</p>
