<p style="text-align:center;">
I looked up at the morning sky,<br>
As a dream passed me by.<br>
Everything was blurred<br>
and I was brought into a light<br>
Up came this lady, she said<br>
please don’t get a fright<br>
Only with this tiny swirl,<br>
Your kundalini will start to twirl;<br>
Let it reach up high,<br>
Higher than the sky.<br>
Today is a new beginning<br>
Let you heart be right<br>
And let you path be bright<br>
Don’t let anything bring you down,<br>
And you have to be cleared<br>
if you want to hear my sound.<br>
Now stroll along the path to heavens,<br>
Take the first step and try to reach<br>
the seventh<br>
Feel the Everflowing Ocean of bliss,<br>
And try your best to create peace.<br>
That is all you have to do,<br>
Let Shri Ganesha guide you through.<br>
Please light up the lamp of others,<br>
And spread this wonderful joy of Mother’s<br>
Fulfil Her dream, Her goal and Her desire,<br>
and let Her love spread as fast as fire.<br>
The lady and the dream<br>
started to fade away,<br>
And there was only one thing in my mind,<br>
To make this world<br>
go towards the right way,<br>
And spread to everyone,<br>
Mother’s Joy and peace divine.<br>
</p>
