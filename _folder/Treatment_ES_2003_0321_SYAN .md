Howdy! For all those who haven't heard of it, here's a tip about a super catch-clearer (a household technique used for ages in India against negativity):<br>
Wrap dried chillies (the tinier ones are hotter and more potent), black mustard seeds and salt in a paper towel; tape closed; vibrate; use freely to clear all blockages! Can be carried in the pockets, put under the pillow, laid on or used to bandhan chakras.<br>
For best results, put on mustard oil and camphor after use and burn. (Can also be flushed down the toilet.)<br>
Love, Ed<br>
