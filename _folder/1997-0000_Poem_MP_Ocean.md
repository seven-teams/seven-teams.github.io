<br>

<p>
Deep blue waster, never ending,<br>
Different shades together blending,<br>
Each tiny drop dissolves,<br>
And becomes part of the whole.<br>
<br>
The ocean tosses in it's wake,<br>
Forming enormous waves that break,<br>
Upon the rocks, all foaming white,<br>
Tossing, turning, through the night.<br>
<br>
When dawn breaks, it's calm and dear,<br>
The only sounds that you can hear,<br>
Are the sounds of little waves,<br>
lapping on the beach,<br>
Reaching the sands, white sunbleached.<br>
<br>
The ocean is placid throughout the day,<br>
And then the people go away,<br>
It's lime to end another day,<br>
Tossing and turning, forever churning,<br>
Cleaning the sands for the next day,<br>
When the children come and play. 
</p>
