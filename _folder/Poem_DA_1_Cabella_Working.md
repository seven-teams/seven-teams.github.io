<br>

<p>
My words fall into a empty sky.<br>
Simply to coalesce with the world of a passerby.<br>
What is it that supports the sounds.<br>
Making known feeling to those around.<br>
I sat and watched as worlds combined.<br>
I observed as saints began to shine.<br>
For once worlds unto themselves, they again return to the reality of oneness.<br>
Stayed by a force from within.<br>
What is this dynamism where in they stay.<br>
This love which ends the night of a lonely souls play.<br>
Threading together as pearls on a string.<br>
Reuniting as one, a divine being.<br>
</p>
