<p style="text-align:center;">
1.<br>
Pieces all go around in a wheel<br>
And you stitch it up fine<br>
to make a quilt of it<br>
a year's time of stitching<br>
seven stitches to the inch<br>
real fine and elegant<br>
don't stretch the bias<br>
happy squares<br>
to cover a bed, double<br>
so many pieces cut fine<br>
waking no sense<br>
a pile of pieces colorful<br>
in a year's time patterns<br>
emerge, true<br>
as patches of cotton<br>
merge artful<br>
seven stitches to the inch.<br>
<br>
2.<br>
So beautiful to see<br>
but it's the sounds<br>
that open your heart<br>
with their sudden<br>
strength<br>
air stretching wide<br>
hear the whoosh<br>
of broad-winged hawks<br>
flying<br>
filling you<br>
with freedom.<br>
<br>
3.<br>
Cave beauty, call the cool breeze<br>
streaming songs up from fresh wetland<br>
water wild swans bathing in the duck-damp<br>
echoing sanctuary, encircle me<br>
blowing treasured stars<br>
across the washed night sky.

  <list-item color="BlanchedAlmond"  width="280"><b>Author's introduction from 1987-0200 The Wind, Volume 1, Issue 5, Page 6:</b> "These verses are part of a long poem written during a month-long sojourn on an island in Northern Maine.<br>
The beauty and pure vibrations of the peace inspired the poem which is part of a Master's thesis project in integrated arts in education.<br>
The presence of water, sky and birds constantly reflected Mother's love.<br>
Quilting by ladies throughout the year is a traditional folk craft still maintained. I participated in weekly quilting sessions. This was a highlight because of the beauty of the quilt ' s swirling colors in a swastika-like pattern, and the gentle good-heartedness of the island residents."</list-item>
