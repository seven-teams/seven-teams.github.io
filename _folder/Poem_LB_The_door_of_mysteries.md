<br>

<p>
Open the door of mysteries<br>
Let me go through.<br>
Cloaked, and a little lonely<br>
Like all who set out on journeys alone.<br>
Yet scarcely looking back,<br>
Since each step must be taken<br>
with attention, each step counts:<br>
<br>
Already you are elsewhere,<br>
Gone ahead of yourself.<br>
<br>
You must spiral in<br>
through yet more skins<br>
(though many have been stripped off since this began),<br>
turn inward like the whorled ear<br>
to delicate chambers of nacreous dawn.<br>
<br>
The turret's stairs wind down,<br>
cold steel at heel and arm.<br>
<br>
Here at the bottom, or another time,<br>
after one or other descent,<br>
the secret may be revealed.<br>
The mystery of mysteries perhaps will be:<br>
another door.<br>
<br>
Or should you turn, go up the stair?<br>
Back to where that fresh outer air<br>
Where everything –<br>
bird, rose, water stream,<br>
the light on leaves –<br>
manifests the mystery.<br>
</p>
