<br>

<p>
A string slides<br>
While dirt clings<br>
to surrounding hairs<br>
<br>
Itsâ€™ place is found<br>
The knots are sown<br>
The cloth is done<br>
<br>
So is the path of string<br>
On its way to becoming more<br>
While being less<br>
<br>
An echo carries today<br>
A memory away<br>
In stillness, in fog<br>
<br>
Sounds insulated<br>
Smells profound,<br>
Memories pull the string<br>
<br>
The knot unties<br>
Emotions pour in<br>
Filling the space where the union had been<br>
</p>

And our emotions get completely entangled in the drama. A drama that ends the moment we stop thinking."</list-item>
