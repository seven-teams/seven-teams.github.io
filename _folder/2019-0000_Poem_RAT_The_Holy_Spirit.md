<p>
Yours is the Summer Rain My Love.<br>
Yours are the rocky crags and peaks.<br>
Yours the Sweet Meadows.<br>
Yours is the World to Behold - and beyond.<br>
<br>
Yours the moody storm-clouds beneath a sullen sky<br>
Is that Your mood today?<br>
<br>
The call of the young buzzard echoes across the vastness which is her world.<br>
The Nature rolls out a soft carpet of green - so You may rest Your eyes upon Her.<br>
<br>
We are Yours.<br>
We came from You.<br>
We will return to You.<br>
Do with us as You will.<br>
We offer You our deepest surrender, in that only can we be with You and share Your Joy.<br>
<br>
When I surrender my last breath unto You - may we play together, in Your World, in child-like abandon.<br>
</p>

I wrote it after morning meditation one day at my home in Congleton, Cheshire.<br>
The Summer Rain was gently falling outside my window and Iâ€™d felt close to Shri Mataji during meditation."<br>
