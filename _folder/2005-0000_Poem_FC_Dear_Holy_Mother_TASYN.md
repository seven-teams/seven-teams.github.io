<p>
When Your children listen delicately<br>
to the perfect pink peace of morning,<br>
we hear in the timeless solace<br>
that all is in celebration of Your Name.<br>
<br>
When Your children pass meekly upon<br>
the footsteps of history’s rugged roads,<br>
we witness the years of sweet discovery<br>
seeking ever to arrive at this Divine Hour.<br>
<br>
When Your children follow gently<br>
the whispers of angels dancing in Your Hands,<br>
the light of each reflection becomes a blessing,<br>
and we discover all that there is to Believe.<br>
<br>
When Your children melt into clouds<br>
of music in the company of heaven,<br>
we understand that in this world we are one<br>
and that now we play in no ordinary moment.<br>
<br>
When Your children touch the golden breeze<br>
and fly above the meagre into Your Blaze,<br>
we inhale the Vision eternal and receive<br>
all the faith we shall ever need.<br>
<br>
When Your children bow before You<br>
and offer flowers in the making of our hearts<br>
we are fragrant and heavy with the desire<br>
to create anew Your Land of Grace.<br>
<br>
When Your children stand and share in Truth<br>
this magic that words can never speak,<br>
our conviction bears the gravity of every<br>
monument declaring Your Infinity.<br>
<br>
When Your children feel dearly<br>
all the beauty upon these ripples of creation,<br>
we each become the depth that we sense<br>
and embrace our place in Your Story.<br>
<br>
When we realise in hushed gratitude<br>
the adventure of these rich and sacred days,<br>
we know that we are worthy of Your choosing<br>
and find the courage to be Your children.<br>
