<p>
If all the world were paper,<br>
And all the sea were ink,<br>
If all the trees were bread and cheese,<br>
What would we have to drink?<br>
<br>
If all the world were realised,<br>
And blessed from above,<br>
If all the people knew the truth,<br>
Would there be anything but love?<br>
<br>
If all the world were realised,<br>
And blessed from above,<br>
If all the world could feel your joy,<br>
Oh, Mother, would there be anything but love?<br>
</p>
