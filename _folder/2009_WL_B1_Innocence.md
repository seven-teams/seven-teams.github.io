<p style="text-align:center;">
Innocence is not a word from puritans<br>
Innocence is honesty – to myself and others<br>
<br>
Innocence is not just children’s play<br>
Innocence is powerful – a state of mind<br>
<br>
Innocence gives love of universal nature<br>
Innocence gives joy with everlasting freedom<br>
<br>
Innocence does not know of fear<br>
Innocence can restore itself when harmed<br>
<br>
It is an island in the ocean of my soul<br>
It is a place the Mother has created out of care<br>
<br>
It is a place of refuge yet of knowledge<br>
It is place where I am myself – yet no one is excluded<br>
<br>
A place where children come together<br>
A place where children trust each other<br>
A place eternally protected by the Mother
