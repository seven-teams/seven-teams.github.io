<br>

<p>
The golden gleam of the first ray of the sun<br>
Of Satya Yuga<br>
Has already pierced the satanic gloom and<br>
The Water Carrier<br>
Walks across the arc heaven with a Pitcher full of<br>
Divine Water<br>
The Golden Age Of Man<br>
Has begun<br>
A new day of hope has dawned<br>
The chosen ones have already drunk the Drink of Enlightenment<br>
From the Pitcher of the Water Carrier<br>
That which is The Water Of Life<br>
Which feeds The Tree Of Life<br>
The Bubbling Stream of Joy And Transformation<br>
The promise now fulfilled<br>
That which the seeker has sought and found<br>
Those who have thirsted long<br>
Now drink deeply from the Bubbling Stream<br>
Which pours from The Heart Of The Water Carrier<br>
The Heart where they have been<br>
Bathed and purified and<br>
Restored to Life Everlasting<br>
The Thames shall become the Ganges and<br>
Those who eat the soil of England shall be restored<br>
The chosen ones whose bodies are The Temples of God<br>
Who are no longer thirsty but purified and saturated with<br>
The Water Of Life<br>
Shall pour It forth in rivulets<br>
In streams<br>
In rivers<br>
In torrents of tears of compassion and Love<br>
And transform the Universe<br>
The akasha shall vibrate with Divine Harmony<br>
Mankind shall walk hand in hand with God<br>
The Shepherd and the sheep shall become one<br>
The paths of man shall end where they began.<br>
</p>
