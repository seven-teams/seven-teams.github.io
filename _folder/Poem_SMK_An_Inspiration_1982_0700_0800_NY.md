<p>
1. Ladies and Gentlemen of the present Generation,<br>
With a great deliberation,<br>
I have intended to give you an idea of my resolution,<br>
In a fine piece of alliteration<br>
Prepared by my own imagination,<br>
And stolen from no quotation.<br>
<br>
2. Sahaja Yogis of the present Generation,<br>
My idea is to perfect my Meditation,<br>
Which at present is a source of botheration,<br>
As my chakras need clarification and purification—<br>
From the evil forces surrounding my constitution;<br>
As we physical beings differ from Nation to Nation.<br>
<br>
3. Sahaja Yogis of the present Generation,<br>
The thought of Concentration and Meditation,<br>
Is a great source of inspiration;<br>
Which by raising your Kundalini without any botheration,<br>
Your Vibrations blossom by transformation—<br>
And thereby enjoy bliss with divine acceleration.<br>
<br>
4. With these few words, Sahaja Yogis, of the present Generation,<br>
Permit me to occupy my location of Meditation:<br>
Which by no means is a sanguine disposition<br>
To our beloved Sahaja Yogis' contemplation and aspiration,<br>
Leading to a great world-wide Brotherhood of Association,<br>
Which no doubt will flourish from Generation to Generation.<br>
</p>
