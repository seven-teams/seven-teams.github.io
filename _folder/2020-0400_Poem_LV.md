<p>
Some poets<br>
Being driven by despair at the state of the World<br>
try to describe shadows.<br>
They fear to trust the light inside and fear to believe in<br>
The blue-throated God: the ever-young, wise, beardless God<br>
Who dreamed of us<br>
That One who epitomises Love<br>
and who waits in the calyx of each heart; shining.<br>
In this quiet time You have given us space to realize<br>
We were never alone.<br>
</p>
