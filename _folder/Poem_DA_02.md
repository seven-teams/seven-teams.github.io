<br>

<p>
I once walked upon a beach, hoping God would hear.<br>
The echoes off the ocean waves of a young mans falling tear.<br>
I once ambled through a field, pining that God would see.<br>
The shadow of an only man, lying hallow as a tree.<br>
I once sat on a mountain top, with such appetence that God should know.<br>
The dreams in this young mans heart, are pure as falling snow.<br>
I once cast a stone afar and upon a ripple there rode a golden star.<br>
I was in the state of stillness till the brink of the first wave.<br>
With such vigor it toiled.<br>
As a child in his younger days.<br>
Oh, that I see this laudable dream.<br>
for I had induced to my pond a magical gleam.<br>
Though enslaved were the waves, in the stillness which withered them away.<br>
We too toil our days, tell the wane away.<br>
<br>
Then I imagine that I am the golden star,<br>
riding this ripple of life.<br>
Where in the midst of creation, God has cast a stone giving meaning to his pond.<br>
I ride the ripple tell the conclusion on my days, when the<br>
quiescence of Gods love brings a close to his play.<br>
With love perfect, I would delight in rendering pleasure to God.<br>
To be dear enough to him, that he bequeaths me life, merely to watch me play.<br>
Though times are such, when in doubt.<br>
One forgets that he rides in God's pond.<br>
He thinks his life to be salient.<br>
Rather than simply... satiating Gods desire to enjoy.<br>
</p>
