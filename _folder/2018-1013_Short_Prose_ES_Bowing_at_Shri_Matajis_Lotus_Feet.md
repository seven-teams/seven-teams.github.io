<p style="text-align:center;">
We were always so grateful whenever we had<br>
the rare blessing to go bow down to the<br>
Divine Mother, at Shri Mataji's Lotus Feet<br>
in person, to be engulfed<br>
in Absolute Love.<br>
She is now still directly available to each of us,<br>
and is constantly waiting for you in your daily<br>
life, and me in mine, to simply kneel down in<br>
our pure attention and open our hands, heads<br>
and hearts - any moment we choose.<br>
Everything else is illusion.<br>
This is our highest goal and reality,<br>
beyond life's traumas and their causes.<br>
<br>
Your self-love, self-faith and pure willpower<br>
born of pure desire will lead you to All That,<br>
now and forever.<br>
</p>
