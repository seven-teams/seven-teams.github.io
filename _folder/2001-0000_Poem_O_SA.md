<p>
There is a hall, not very far,<br>
Open the door and here the Sahaja Yogis are.<br>
The hall is beautifully decorated,<br>
And every flower is vibrated.<br>
<br>
Children are playing every instrument you could say,<br>
For it is Shri Mataji's birthday.<br>
Every one is celebrating (all over the nation),<br>
After all it is a cause for celebration.<br>
<br>
There sits Adi Shakti giving every one vibrations,<br>
Making you feel beautiful sensations,<br>
She dazzles everyone with her lovely smile,<br>
Her love is longer than the river Nile,<br>
<br>
She gives you joy beyond imagination,<br>
Giving Sahaja Yoga to the whole creation.
</p>
