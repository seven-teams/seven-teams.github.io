<p>
They say that variety is the spice of life;<br>
Mother, tell us of detachment<br>
and the will to witness,<br>
smilingly to watch the 'play',<br>
and to purify our desires.<br>
<br>
There's a jewel in the heart of the lotus,<br>
Stillness in heart and mind.<br>
As we adjust our orbits in this universe<br>
We fulfill Shri Mother's Desires.<br>
<br>
Beginning to understand the Power and Benevolence<br>
Of the blessings of the Adi Shakti;<br>
Our Will is inspired,<br>
Our hearts raised up<br>
And the Dharma of Sahaja is duely done.<br>
</p>
