Dear Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginīs,<br>
<br>
The Poetry uploads were started on 2024-0218, when 120 Poems were uploaded. That formed our first annual report on Poetry. Since then, i.e., in the last 394 days an additional 120 poems have been uploaded, which represents a poem uploaded every other 3.2833 days (the idea being to, as an average, upload one poem every other 3.5 days).<br>
All the 240 Poems can be enjoyed at the link:<a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/tag-folder/"> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Eternal Moments</b></font></a>
Please kindly share the news and the links with all our brothers and sisters.<br>
