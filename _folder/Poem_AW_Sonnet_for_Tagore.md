<p>
I worked at Penguin Books<br>
In bygone days of yore,<br>
And chanced upon a book of poems<br>
By Rabindranath Tagore<br>
<br>
His photo showed a yogi, a mystic<br>
Kurta, flowing hair and beard<br>
He ran his family businesses<br>
Was more familiar with balance sheets,<br>
Profit and Loss accounts in his daily regimen<br>
Than with mysticism and yoga,<br>
<br>
Appearances are illusive, for he had the true connection<br>
He was a realized soul, ineffable.<br>
He spoke to the oneness of man<br>
Prophesied we'd all stand together on Bharat's shore.<br>
</p>
