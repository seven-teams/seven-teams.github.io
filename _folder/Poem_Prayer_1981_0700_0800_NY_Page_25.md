<p>
You who Fought again, and won,<br>
the war the angels lost,<br>
You who watched and wept when Christ<br>
was tried and scourged and cross'd,<br>
You who knew the age to come<br>
would fragment and bemuse,<br>
Delude and harass, scare, embarrass,<br>
heartbreak and confuse,<br>
Who chose another human birth<br>
as Mother, Lover, Sage,<br>
To enlighten, brighten, usher<br>
in the Golden age;<br>
<br>
Who chose to grant to those who yearned<br>
the gift of love sublime,<br>
Where few become the mass and buds<br>
become the blossom time;<br>
Who chose to show us how to know<br>
the spark that is ourself,<br>
And how to join that grain of God<br>
in each to God Himself;<br>
The union thatâ€™s been longed for life<br>
by life and heart by heart,<br>
To thank you, Mother, for these gifts<br>
how do we even start?<br>
<br>
But grant us, Mother, even more,<br>
This land of ours enthral,<br>
Make Your Antipodean time<br>
a blessing time for all.<br>
Help us, Mother, if you will,<br>
to grow, to spread, to share,<br>
To reach those souls we know You not<br>
but need Your loving care.<br>
Oh, call again Your Battle cry,<br>
that ringing, stinging AUM,<br>
That on this arid continent<br>
the blossom time may come!<br>
</p>
