<p>
The door to heaven has been opened!<br>
As in the Holy scriptures it was mentioned<br>
through the Narrow Gate, has passed our Attention<br>
By the Divine Grace of our Mother's Love and compassion.<br>
<br>
We desire to be weapons in Her hands.<br>
And long to be the sparkling light in Her innocent eyes.<br>
To rise up dutifully to Her rightful expectation.<br>
So that in us shines sari Ganesha's manifestation.<br>
<br> 
To throw away our domain and attachment<br>
To enjoy the bliss of true whole hearted detachment<br>
To be ready when descends the Golden blazing key,<br>
Most eagerly-awaited arrival of the awesome Shri Kalki.<br>
</p>
