<p>
To you who seek<br>
Ne'r mind how meek<br>
Your search is not futile<br>
For they who found<br>
True yoga's shore<br>
Had searched millennium's mile.<br>
<br>
Seek not for gain Seek<br>
not for fame<br>
In this truth stays concealed<br>
Seek the truth<br>
Inside yourself<br>
And all will be revealed.<br>
<br>
On Yoga's Shore<br>
By Sahaja's score<br>
The way to truth prevails<br>
And Mataji Nirmala's here<br>
To show us Truth unveiled.<br>
<br>
To you who seek<br>
Ne'r mind how meek<br>
Time can only allay<br>
When outstretched arms<br>
Of yogis who<br>
Await to show the way.<br>
<br>
And when the truth<br>
Adorns your head<br>
And you in light abound<br>
Seek not<br>
To keep it to yourself<br>
'Tis here heaven's key is found.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Jai Mataji<br>
</p>
