<p>
Adi Shakti came to Earth<br>
To give Her children second birth.<br>
All Heaven came with Her to stay<br>
And join in this enlightened Play.<br>
<br>
How does it feel, this Kingdom come,<br>
That shines within each lucky one?<br>
You enjoy your own deep light<br>
And Peace that glows to highest heights.<br>
<br>
Let's give thanks for all the Grace<br>
That radiates in every face.<br>
And may our hearts expand to find<br>
That this will include all mankind.<br>
</p>
