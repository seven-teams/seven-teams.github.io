<p>
When I was small and full of glee<br>
A little thought once came to me.<br>
"Hello. I'm who you are," it said<br>
And quickly it filled up my head.<br>
<br>
From this time on, my once cool brain<br>
Got loud and hot under the strain<br>
Of the ego that waged war,<br>
Leaving my soul broken and poor.<br>
<br>
I grew up lost inside this web<br>
Of words and vanity instead<br>
Of the freedom I once knew,<br>
When I was young and fresh and new.<br>
<br>
Decades passed without respite<br>
From the noise that dulled my life.<br>
Every day I hoped and prayed<br>
That from this heat I would be saved.<br>
<br>
Then one busy Christmas Eve,<br>
When I just could not believe<br>
That innocence could ever return<br>
Bringing the joy for which I yearned,<br>
<br>
I fell into a fathomless sleep<br>
And heard a sound rise from the deep.<br>
It started with an 'Ah', then 'Ommm'<br>
And rose into a sonic boom.<br>
<br>
And suddenly I was aware<br>
Of a baby's loving stare.<br>
Its radiance filled up my mind<br>
With something sweet from beyond time.<br>
<br>
And then I heard Its Mother sigh.<br>
That sigh resounded through the sky.<br>
And I felt Her kiss my head -<br>
And the Wind became my friend.<br>
<br>
I rose to heights of silent Love<br>
Where Joy rains down from high above,<br>
And saw the Sun, not as a star,<br>
But as a glorious Avatar.<br>
<br>
Oh, how my heart did dance and sing<br>
In that sweet, eternal spring!<br>
I thanked the Mother and Her Son<br>
For all the wonderful things they'd done.<br>
<br>
Waking up, I smiled to see<br>
A sunbeam on my Christmas tree.<br>
The darkness of my life had passed<br>
And here I was at home, at last.<br>
