<br>

<p>
Thou hast made me endless, such is thy pleasure,<br>
This frail vessel Thou emptiest again and again,<br>
And fillest it ever with fresh life.<br>
This little flute ofa reed Thou hast carried<br>
Over hills and dales, and hast breathed<br>
Through it melodies eternally new.<br>
At the immortal touch of Thy hand my little<br>
Heart loses its limits in joy and gives<br>
Birth to utterance ineffable.<br>
Thy infinite gifts comet o me only on these<br>
Very small hands of mine.<br>
Ages pass, and still Thou pourest,<br>
And still there is room to fill.<br>
</p>
