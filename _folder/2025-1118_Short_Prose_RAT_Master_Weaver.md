<p>
I am reminded of the intricate patterns that the Divine Mother weaves.<br>
She is the Master Weaver of our lives. Long before we drew breath, She waved Her Hand in bandhan and set the pattern of our life.<br>
Who we meet, where we go and everything we do. Not only this, but with Divine timing - not fixed, yet perfect. <br>
The channel between us and this Glorious Being is desire. Our desire.<br>
One day in the journey of our lives we are ready to say 'Now I need to know the truth' or even 'Where are You Holy Mother, I need You'. Instantly She hears our Heart's Desire and instantly She is there. Every tiny detail is accounted for.<br>
Every tiny detail is woven with the most delicate attention. And yet, the most powerful action. More than any other truth, we are in Her hands.<br>
After desire, comes surrender. So She can continue Her work, through the intricate pattern of our lives.
