<p style="text-align:center;">
Mother You fly<br>
through the sky<br>
of our dreams;<br>
Your wind-song of love<br>
lifts the air.<br>
Cool waters of time<br>
fall with heavenly rhyme<br>
on Your children<br>
who live everywhere.<br>
Gold droplets of love<br>
form a halo above each man, woman, child<br>
in Your breast.<br>
And the trees of pure time<br>
shade this lotus of Thine -<br>
Your children, together,<br>
at rest.<br>
We gather our love<br>
in garlands above<br>
Your beautiful head as You walk<br>
through the airport of dreams<br>
- home of great Sahaj scenes -<br>
these flowers of bliss are enough.<br>
We love You, our Mother,<br>
Form Divine everywhere,<br>
we are blessed in<br>
age, time and space;<br>
we bow at Your Feet,<br>
we kneel down at Your seat<br>
just to gaze on your Heavenly Face.<br>
We give You our hearts -<br>
the sum of all parts<br>
is You, Shri Nirmal Devi;<br>
in the ashrams of glory<br>
we sing Your great story<br>
O Beloved Shri Adi Shakti.<br>
</p>
