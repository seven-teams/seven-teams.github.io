<br>

<p>
The fish who first crawled on to terra firma must've felt confused<br>
The first sound they heard was rhythm<br>
The rhythm of the waves<br>
The gentle sshh of ebb and flow, perhaps a stormy cataclysm<br>
<br>
And the fetus in a mother's womb<br>
It was rhythm too that it first heard<br>
Heartbeat, ba boom, ba boom, ba boom<br>
Both a rhythm and a tune.<br>
<br>
We're surrounded by rhythm, heard and not heard<br>
Felt and not felt. Day night, season<br>
The movement of Mother Earth around the sun<br>
Hurtling through space with no apparent rhyme nor reason<br>
<br>
Each center of spiritual power<br>
Flowers within, each with their own rotational speed<br>
And sounds, rhythmic sounds that indicate wellbeing<br>
From seed to flower, flower to seed.<br>
</p>
