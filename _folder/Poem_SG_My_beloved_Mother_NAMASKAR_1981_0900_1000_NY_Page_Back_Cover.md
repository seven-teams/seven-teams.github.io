<p>
As beauty to the flowers and pleasantness to the breeze,<br>
As coolness to the moon and rays to the sun;<br>
As waves to the ocean and creatures to the earth;<br>
As rivers to the mountains and Gods to the humen,<br>
Oh Devi, I am to my Mother.<br>
No force in any form from anywhere can deprive me.<br>
Oh Mother, let divineful arts be created with deities of heaven<br>
Finer ever for the benefit of great humen;<br>
Let loveliness be enriched on this beloved Mother Earth<br>
For the evolution of human even to become worth;<br>
Let there be no hatredness, no sinfulness, no imperfectness,<br>
Oh Mother,<br>
On this earth which reduce the human beings to wither.<br>
OM is the language of the Universe with power<br>
And no other language equal to Sahaja to cover<br>
The Mankind with virtues and magnitude in values.<br>
Ever to enrich with kindness to cows and to the calves. Virtueless humanity venerate it never<br>
And fanatism is the folk of life for ever<br>
In the name of language and land<br>
And in the name of religion with brand<br>
Oh Mother, when they realise that the humanity is one<br>
With kindness and help and values to win<br>
Over the race of time and change of all,<br>
Oh Mother, let there be fearless society that never fall.<br>
Ever to live happy, healthy and gay in the ways of divine.<br>
Let there be love for each other to enrich themselves finer and shrine,<br>
let there be trust and truth in the paths of life.<br>
Let there be no mis-identifications that kills the humanity with ignorance as knife.<br>
Let there be true knowledge for the seekers of truth,<br>
without this what can I pray on this Mother Earth,<br>
Ever with thy grace.<br>
Thy loving son<br>
</p>
