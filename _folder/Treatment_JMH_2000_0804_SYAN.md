<p>
Here is a powerful mantra for the left side:<br>
"Om twameva sakshat Shri Rudra Kali, Bhadra Kali, Adi Kali, Mahakali sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Namaha".<br>
This mantra can be used during a candle or camphor treatment on the left side, or during mediation with your right hand on Mother Earth.<br>
It can also be used when you feel a pressure on the heart caused by over activity. Use the balancing tech- nique of the energy from the left side to the right side and at the same time say this mantra keeping in mind that a left side problem is sometimes connected with a right side problem. For instance epileptic fits can be stopped with this mantra.<br>
