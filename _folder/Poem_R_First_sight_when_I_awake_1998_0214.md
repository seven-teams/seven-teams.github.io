<p style="text-align:center;">
Opening my eyes at the fluttering of dawn<br>
casting warm shadows in my room,<br>
With a strange feeling I sense I'm being watched,<br>
I slowly slide over to my side, only to confirm my<br>
nostalgic feeling, I am being watched!<br>
Across the room. through gloominess, our eyes<br>
engage,<br>
Loving eyes that penetrate through me,<br>
hypnotising and sincere,<br>
Mother is encast in jade, gold, glass and garland<br>
with flowers.<br>
With trembling outstretched palms, I experience<br>
the mornings spiritual energy.<br>
Circled kumkum draws my attention to Mother's<br>
Sahasrara where a pure Halo has manifested,<br>
The Aura is overwhelming!<br>
I sit upright expectantly absorbing every bit of<br>
Saintly powers directed to me,<br>
Mother smiles graciously, silently wishing me<br>
Good Morning!<br>
It's the dawning of a brand new day for the rest of<br>
my life.<br>
I humbly bow, whispering "Good Morning to you too â€” Mother".<br>
