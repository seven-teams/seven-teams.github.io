<p>
You make so many different friends<br>
Along the walk of life<br>
Some may stay, And some may<br>
What does a real friend mean today?<br>
<br>
Well I have found some true friends<br>
Who give but never want<br>
They except me for what I am<br>
And to me that means a lot.<br>
<br>
I met them at a meeting<br>
In a most peculiar way<br>
I went along to exercise<br>
But it wasn't on that day.<br>
<br>
Instead they both showed me<br>
What I'd been searching for<br>
So I went back to their meetings<br>
So I could learn some more<br>
<br>
They gave something special<br>
And they helped me understand<br>
So tome these friends are true ones<br>
For they were for me.<br>
<br>
Now should you read the pane<br>
And you ever see<br>
An AD that reads Yoga<br>
Then don't you be like me<br>
You won't need to wear your sneakers<br>
Or your aerobic gear<br>
But go along as I did<br>
You may find some true friends there.<br>
<br>
Now I've never been religious<br>
Guess I didn't understand<br>
That there is really someone out there<br>
So just hold out your hand.<br>
</p>
