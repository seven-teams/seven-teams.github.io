"We have to understand that we have a responsibility, towards Sahaja Yoga. And that is what, if you understand the first responsibility is that: you have to be very good Sahaja Yogis, to begin with. That's the greatest.<br>
......<br>
We are Sahaja Yogis, we have our own traditions, we are people of a very high families, why should we take to these dirty things? So I would request you to tell your children not to be impressed by this dirty, horrible culture that is evolved.<br>
It was not so bad in the West, I tell you, it was not. It is now ruined the whole place. They have no idea as to how filthy it has become.<br>
If you are real Sahaja Yogis, you will s... be very quiet, unassuming, dignified, mature, as well as you will be very moral. You have to be very and you ... you should only like people who are moral.<br>
This is not to be taught but to be shown to the children: how you yourself live. If the mother is all the time busy with her beauty and this and that, the child also takes it. All this filth and dirt should not settle down, at least in Sahaja Yoga.<br>
......<br>
'My children, my wife, my house, my everything,' what about, 'My Sahaj Yoga?' Is your responsibility now: you need it, your family needs it, your country needs it, everybody needs it. So, it is your responsibility. Please understand that you have got Sahaja Yoga because you are special people. But the speciality is been that you are responsible for the whole world. Spreading Sahaja Yoga is all right, but to be responsible."<br>
