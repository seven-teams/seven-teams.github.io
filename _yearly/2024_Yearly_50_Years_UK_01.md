"You must know that the whole society is in a whirlwind, it's a whirlwind, you see. So somebody has to steady oneself, and stop, and try to change the winds. And that's why a Sahaja Yogi has to stand up, and understand that respect and reverence of parents is important.<br>
......<br>
This is the point: Sahaja Yogis must know that we have to change and transform ourselves. And that is the point [where] they feel bad. We are not only responsible for our change but we have to bring about the change in the whole world. Where the society is getting destroyed, the human beings are getting destroyed, so we have to stand [up]. So we have to change our way of thinking.<br>
......<br>
Vibrations, as I said that, is the manifestation of the Spirit.<br>
......<br>
Now the first power you have: is to correct yourself, without conditioning yourself.<br>
......<br>
In the same way, Sahaja Yoga is a tremendous Universe. And that Universe you have to move with that respect and love and understanding for each other. Arrogance to each other or saying hurting things to others, or even disrespect, even, you see,  showing your tongue and things like that, it should not be done. You are Saints, you are matured people.<br>
......<br>
You know, England is the Heart of the Universe, and how could it be that foolish? Just think of it: it's the Heart of the Universe, is the heart. It is heart shaped also. Is a very important thing, and that's why I am here with you. So try to respect it and respect its traditions."<br>
