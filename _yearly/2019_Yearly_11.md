<font size="+2"><b>He Is The Embodiment Of Morality</b><br></font>
</p>

<p>
"Christ stood for morality. And about Him also, in these modern times, they are saying all kinds of filthy things. They cannot understand a character which is moral. To this extent we have gone. Morality is out of question. You do whatever you like, as long as you go to church and confess you are all right.<br> 

These are thek [the] absurdities of modern religions: every religion has problems. And the worst, I feel, when you have the Support of the world as your Leader, how can you allow people to have such a[n] immoral life? Immorality, how can you tolerate, when you follow the example of Christ? Out of question! He is the Embodiment of Morality, He is Śhrī Gaṇeśh and how can you allow people to come to churches, to the temples and allow them to have immoral life? What is the atonement for such people? The basis of Christ's life, the whole being of Christ, is morality, to establish purity."<br>
