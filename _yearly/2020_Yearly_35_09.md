</p>

<p>
<b>Version 1:</b> "The greatest event was that Vishwa Nirmala Dharma was established and since five to six years has been growing and people are fully involved in it. People are understanding that all the old religions have merged into this new Religion. People who were roaming the temples and mosques are now fully settled in this New Dharma and are trying very hard to establish the Vishwa Nirmala Dharma within themselves."<br>
<br>
<b>Version 2:</b> "The most important and joy-giving thing is that Vishwa Nirmala Dharma was established. Today, I think, it's been almost five to six years. Since then Vishwa Nirmala Dharma is flourishing and people are accepting it completely. Now even the Sahaja Yogis who wouldn't accept it in any way, who were following their religions, and would keep harping the same old thing, or would go to the wrong gurus, would roam around in temples, in mosques, have finally settled here. They are trying to somehow find this religion within themselves, the Vishwa Nirmala Dharma."<br>
