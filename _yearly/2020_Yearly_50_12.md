<font size="+2"><b>The Resurrection In Sahaja Yoga Is That Your Faith Is Solid</b><br></font>
</p>

<p>
"So, for a Sahaja Yogi, it is very important that, after coming to Realization, he has to be very introspective.<br>
......<br>
Sahaj means there is the Divine Power. And this All-pervading Divine Power is looking after us.<br>
......<br>
So now, you see in Sahaja Yoga, many people who are very steady, who are upright, who are very valuable, they are like the people who know they are standing on the rocks. But those who are not yet so steady are the people, they think they are's still dwindling on some sort of a funny waters of this life. The rocks are big there, you standing on the rocks, and also that has come out of faith that nothing can disturb us, that faith, nothing can trouble us. 

As far as Christ is concerned, naturally, I mean, He knew everything, so He was sure about it. He never bothered, He never dwindled, He never uh doubted. He knew that, that He is the Son of God. And that was the fact that He knew very well. And He never challenged it, He never doubted it, nothing. It is so. And that's why He, I say, was standing on the rocks.

While the other people, even Sahaja Yogis, have to become like Christ as far as the faith is concerned.<br>
......<br>
The Resurrection in Sahaja Yoga is that your faith is solid. This you have to achieve: solid faith."<br>
