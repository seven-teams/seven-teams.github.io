"Today is a great auspicious day where I am here on the Birthday of Mother Mary. But today I am going to talk to you about Reality and about Truth.<br>
......<br>
Today specially, on the special day of Christ['s] Mother's birthday, you should not feel guilty and unhappy or melancholic."<br>

"So She incarnated as Mahālakṣhmī when Rāma came on this Earth, first time.<br>
And also, She incarnated as Rādhā when Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa came on this Earth.<br>
And when She came as Mary, it was Mahālakṣhmī who bore the child that is Lord Jesus Christ. So, the child She bore was the great personality of Mahāviṣhṇu."<br>

<b>Objectives:</b><br>
21. To unite all genuine Seekers of Truth divided by dogmas and ignorance so that Satya Yuga (the Age of Truth) is born out of the present Kali Yuga (the Age of Darkness) rather than complete annihilation. To harness all the human resources to achieve this great task for which mass evolution will be needed.<br>
22. To open, organize and run local centers of the Life Eternal Institution in various parts of India and in foreign countries, the centers being opened on the distinct understanding that meditation is the path of the entire human destiny, and that all barriers of states, nations and races are artificial and irrelevant to Life Eternal.<br>
