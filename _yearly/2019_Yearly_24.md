<p>
"So far there have been lots of theories about the Truth, but it never happened that they knew the Truth as Reality. So there have been diversification even in all those theories. Some said, ``This religion is good," some said, ``That religion is good," and all kinds of diversification started. 

And science being an a-moral area, there was no connection established between science and Absolute Truth. 

Science is not absolute, it is always challenged, but Truth is one, it's singular, and it cannot be challenged. But the main ... main thing is that Truth, which is Absolute Truth, has to become the reality. 

As you'n [in] chemistry, you have, say, periodic law as a reality. Also in the physics, same way, it has to be a reality. 

So, the seeking of Truth, when it reaches that point where the Truth becomes reality, it is the Absolute Truth. 

So, what is the Absolute Truth? I can give you as a theory and it has to be proved. In a way it goes, in a way, goes beyond the field of modern science. But it is a science, it is an Absolute Science, which cannot be challenged, which cannot be changed and which everyone knows as the Truth. 

If I say something, it's a theory to you, but it can be proved."<br>
