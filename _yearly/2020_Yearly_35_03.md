"First, we have started Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.<br>
You are under the vision of Śhrī Gaṇeśh, under the guidance of your Spirit, and under the blessings of God Almighty. But be careful, because once you become that, you have to keep to that Dharma, you have to be honest about it. If you are dishonest from today onwards, you be careful, anything can happen to you if you get out of the maryādās. Till you keep to the Maryādās of Sahaja Yoga, saying morning, evening, night that, `I am a Sahaja Yogi,' nobody can har... hurt, nobody can trouble you. On the contrary you will be enjoying life if you keep to the maryādās. But if you leave the Maryādās of Sahaja Yoga, you will have big problems.<br>
So this is the second thing I want to tell you that today we have started the Great Religion, which was promised long time back, of realized Souls. "<br>
