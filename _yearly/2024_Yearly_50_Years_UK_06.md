"And when the children don't respect their mothers because they have no respect for anything else whatsoever. In the first thing and the last thing is the respect for the mother. If one does not respect the mother, or the motherhood, that means he has no respect for himself either.<br>
So how does he exist? He exists through his mother. So mother is a very-very important intuition ... institution for the whole creation, for your creation and for the creation of your children and all the progeny that has to come.<br>
......<br>
But the mother who is your own mother, whom you know as your mother, who gives you physical birth, is the mother who gives you much more than you know of. Because her blood has her vibrations, and when she gives you her blood she gives you her vibrations, she gives her sustainance [sustenance], she gives you her desires and also she gives you a push in your evolution if she is a[n] evolved person.<br>
Now, in mother and the child relationship, mother gives a lot. She give[s] ... makes your complete left side. She creates all that left side in you. Because she has desired for you, so she creates that. On the right side she gives you all the beauty of delicate things. And also the hunches that you get in your business or all the flexible moments of your life that you think, `From where unknown I got something?', that's your mother's blessing on you.<br>
You choose your own mother, too, when you are born. So no use just condemning your mother because she's like this, she's a horrid woman, and she's this and that and that. Now, you have chosen her; so better have it.<br>
And she is a very big part of you, I must say.<br>
......<br>
It's a most responsible position is that of a mother. It is even a much more responsible than that of a king has it, to be a mother, because the king can only go up to material level, or up to physical level.<br>
And up to rational level, at the most, a philosopher can go.<br>
And the emotional level may be fulfilled by the wife.<br>
All these things may be done by other people, but spiritual level you can only achieve from your mother's grace."<br>
......<br>
So on this day of Mother Day I would like to bless you, that now you have to give birth to so many thousands of people.<br>
So the power that your Mother has, of giving birth, the spiritual birth, be bestowed upon all of you so that you do this work with the same grace and with the same patience and love and enjoyment."<br>
