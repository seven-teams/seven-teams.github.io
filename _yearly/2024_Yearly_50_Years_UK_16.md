<font size="+2"><b>Sahaja Yoga Must Grow Within You</b><br></font>
</p>

<p>
"Today, it's a great day that you are here to worship your Guru in the realm of-f Hea... the Heart of the Universe. If we can do that in our domain of the heart, we don't have to do anything else.<br>
......<br>
That is how the Sahaja Yoga today is working out in all directions, if you find, to put all upside-down things into right direction, to expose it to reality, to bring all real values, to abolish all n... rotten value systems, all political, economic systems, all s-spiritual theologies, all psychological and all such nonsensical [some laughter] ideas into its proper direction.<br>
How in one In-a... Incarnation it has worked out. You can imagine: how in one Incarnation all these ideas s... have been put right.<br>
......<br>
Sahaja Yoga must grow within you. You should not be, anymore, regarded as immature Sahaja Yogis. I would say: a person who is a matured Sahaja Yogi is the one who can combine so many things together, with all beautiful lines, thin lines, thin maryādās maintained.<br>
But you cannot do the other way round!<br>
......<br>
So let us be in the center. We should be wealthy, but not too much. We should be healthy, but not too much. Uh we should be wise, but not too much. [Laughter, smiles.] 'So far, so good.'<br>
That's how we should move, so we keep to our maryādās, and we become beautiful Sahaja Yogis, who will be congenial to others, who'll be able to get others to... to us, who will be able to project an image of magnetic personalities. And this is what we have to do."<br>
