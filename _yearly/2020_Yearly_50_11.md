"And one has to know that Sahaja Yogis have to be with great potential manifesting.<br>
......<br>
You have to be people of quality, otherwise Sahaja Yoga won't work out. Is not meant for people who are mediocres. If there are few, doesn't matter, but there have to be people of quality. That is one thing for sure.<br>
......<br>
Don't play about with Sahaja Yoga, at all! I'm just warning you, it's a very, very serious thing. People have got heart attacks, have got accidents, have got cancers, all kinds of things, and really I am quite frightened that you people don't realize that there is another force working it out.<br>
So don't take arbitrary decisions. You are very safe in Sahaja Yoga. Stay in Sahaj Yog, grow in Sahaj Yog, enjoy in Sahaj Yog. Everything is there available for you.<br> 
......<br>
There's not going to be any regimentation in Sahaja Yoga at all. It is a thing of love. But you must have love for yourself! I mean, you should be self-disciplined.<br>
......<br>
All such ideas are going to completely blast Sahaja Yoga and finish it off. These are selfish, self-oriented, absolutely out-of-date ideas for Sahaja Yoga."<br>
