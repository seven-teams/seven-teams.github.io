<p>
"It's a ... rare occasion, sometimes, that you feel oneness with the whole Universe, absolutely oneness with the whole Universe when you feel the love that exists between all of you.<br>
Is the love between you, oneness between you, the way you all have opened your heart to each other, as good human beings, as realized Souls, as Saints, is the most fulfilling and satisfying thing for Me.<br>
......<br>
All of you have to become like Me, I'm sure you all can, and achieve that caliber of compassion. All right?<br>
......<br>
And as England is the heart, it has to circulate everything. But the hearts must open out."<br>
