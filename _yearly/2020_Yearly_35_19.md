"Now the understanding should be that now you all have become global and you follow One Religion, that is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma, and you have no other problems as they have in other religions, marrying inter-religion, inter-national. We have no problems.<br>
......<br>
In Sahaja Yoga we have no problems in adjusting because you'll find there are many other couples who are already married and have achieved great success. That's how our Sahaja Yoga has spread all over. We don't believe in on the artificial uh restrictions. We are absolutely open, free. And we should love each other, understand each other, show your affection in such a manner that another person understand[s].<br>
......<br>
So, you are all intelligent to understand, I leave it to you to find out the ways and methods of expression of your family life as ideal vision."<br>
