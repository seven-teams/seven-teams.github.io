<font size="+2"><b>Sahaja Yoga Is The New Religion</b><br></font>
</p>

<p>
"So Sahaja Yoga is the new religion, in which your eyes, your nose, your ears, your tongue, everything, all these organs are educated, taught to say things, to hear things, to see things that are genuine, sincere, beautiful and divine. If we could develop such organs, we will be the best Sahaja Yogis.<br>
......<br>
The best way to understand is that we are the gainers in Sahaja Yoga. We are going to gain out of Sahaja Yoga. So, there should be only thankfulness. Thankfulness towards God that He has been kind to give us His Grace. That is the main thing.<br>
......<br>
I'm sure great people will be born in all the Western countries, definitely. I am sure of it. Very great people. And they will really substantiate Sahaja Yoga. But you should prepare yourself to give them a complete support. All right?<br>
......<br>
<font color="gold">`No, Mātājī, we will do this also and that also.' That will not be allowed. You cannot have it both ways. If Sahaja Yoga has to be practiced, it should be practiced in its pure form.</font><br>
......<br>
<font color="gold">Sahaja Yoga means divine, absolutely divine. And in that divinity, you should receive the Divine. You should attain divinity within yourself.</font><br>
......<br>
<font color="gold">Just understand all the rules and regulations of Sahaja Yoga. These rules and regulations are Laws of the Divine.</font>"<br>

<b>Objectives:</b><br>
5. To introduce the only one internal living religion lying dead and camouflaged under external practices and precepts of religion in all the human beings and for this to organize tours and hold spiritual meetings as per wishes of Mātājī.<br>
9. To create a new generation of self-realized people and to render motherly protection to all such children against evil intentions and to look after their well-being.
