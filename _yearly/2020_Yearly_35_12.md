"The second is, "Dhammam śharaṇaṃ gacchāmi." What is dhammam? Is dharma. What is our dharma? Is Vishwa Nirmal Dharma. That means, now we have become Universal Beings. We are no more Indians, no more Africans, no more English, no more French. We all have become now Sahaji Yogis who are the citizens of [the] Kingdom of God. We have no other identification. This is our dharma. We are eh ... now leading a universal life.<br>
......<br>
We are Universal Beings and our culture is Sahaja Culture. We have given up all our n... nonsensical cultures. In every religion, in every country we have seen the nonsense of our culture, so we believe in the spontaneous Culture of Sahaja Yoga. So we are Universal Beings. And in this State of being Universal Being you have to develop your Collective Consciousness. As first one is for individual, "Buddham śharaṇaṃ gacchāmi," "I surrender myself to Buddha," the second one is the one, "I surrender myself to the collective," in the sense, into the dharma that, the essence of the collective.<br>
Now what is the essence of our collective? What binds us together is Vishwa Nirmal Dharma, the Pure Religion of the Universe. So, once you understand that this is the thing that binds you to each other, you must understand how important it is to keep to Vishwa Nirmal Dharma. In so many ways I have been able to tell you what is Vishwa Nirmal Dharma. So, we have to understand the full content of the Dharma that we are following and also to reflect it back to see, 'Are we really following this Religion?' "<br>
