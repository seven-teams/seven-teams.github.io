"Like uh-uh... people start choosing their life partners in Sahaj Yog. That is not allowed. That is not allowed. You are not to spoil your Āśhrams, your centers, using them for a marriage uh-uh searching society. You must respect it! This point you must respect. If you have to marry, then you can find your life partner outside Sahaja Yoga, to begin with. But if you want to marry in Sahaja Yoga, then you should not go on searching people in Sahaj Yog. Is a very dangerous thing for Sahaj Yog itself and for you people. That is one thing one should never try to do with Sahaja Yogis.<br>
For all practical pur... purposes you are brothers and sisters. And that's why I always encourage marriages between people who belong to another country or ano... another centers.<br>
......<br>
It's very wrong to do such a thing as to arrange your marriage with a Sahaja Yogi by yourself. It will be dangerous. I don't want to say anything, but it won't turn out to be good because it is anti-God activity, absolutely anti-God.<br>
You are supposed to develop your brahmacharya, you are supposed to develop your Mūlādhāra. Instead of that, if you start using a Sahaja Yoginī or a Sahaja Yogi for the selection of your married life, it's going to be very, very troublesome: your Mūlādhāra will not settle down. I mean that's a very bad stroke for your development.<br>
......<br>
For your own sake, for your own pleasures, you should not spoil the name of Sahaja Yoga.<br>
That is one thing I have seen, so I would say that today, as it is the day of purity between relationship, let us know that you have to treat each o... each other as brothers and sisters.<br>
No such play should be followed. Don't allow your mind to drift into this. Because if you allow, then there's no end to it. As it is, you know it is how hard it is to bring you back to normalcy.<br>
......<br>
So the maryādās are to be established first with Me, that understand that you should not try to trouble Me, at all, like this.<br>
Secondly, you must try to please Me by being good people.<br>
I hear that uh somebody is trying to be very egoistical. He doesn't even put on My tapes, he just gives his own lectures. This kind of a thing is very surprising! How can people do like that?"<br>
