<font size="+2"><b>You Will Not Criticize Sahaj Yog</b><br></font>
</p>

<p>
"Today I want certain promises by you to be reached. And the foremost of all, as Christ has said, "Love thy neighbor as thyself." I would say, one step ahead of that: "Love thy neighbor, a Sahaja Yogi, more than yourself." Let us start here. We, I don't ask you to open the whole universe: among you[rselves].<br>
First of all, decide: what have you done for others?<br>
Second: [a] promise you have to make that you will never say a harsh word to any other Sahaja Yogi, even if he beats you hollow. You can tell Me about it. That is the greatest sin you will be committing from today.<br>
......<br>
Tonight, you promise Me that you will look at every Sahaja Yogi as a person in bondage in love and not in hatred.<br>
......<br>
Today, you must promise Me that you will meditate. You can introspect [rather] than getting into your ego.<br>
Thirdly, you will not criticize Sahaj Yog, that is God's own methods, at any cost! If you do not understand a part of Sahaj Yog, you can come and ask Me, but don't criticize. This is you must promise Me."<br>
