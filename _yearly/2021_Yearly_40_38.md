"What Warren has told you is Absolute Truth, no doubt about it. But uh we were not so sure as to say these things out or not, because it's no tactful, sometimes, to tell these things to people. The Truth is too much for the people already overladen with ego and problems and pressures to bear.<br>
......<br>
But is for you to be something great because you have to achieve it. Those who have to achieve: it requires a courage, it requires understanding, and it requires also depth.<br>
If you are a shallow person, you cannot achieve it, it's very difficult. One has to settle you again and again and again and again, still you cannot settle down.<br> 
So, for Me it is nothing, I mean it's something so innate: I know it is so.<br>
......<br>
And that's why you have to be careful about it, and see to it that you all become real flowers of Great Fragrance of Divinity.<br>
And spread this Divinity in your country, understanding, here I am not to criticize anyone or anything, but I am here to nourish you, to give you all the help that is needed, as he said, "To counsel you, and to redeem you, and to comfort you."<br>
For this I have to work very hard. You have no idea how much I work. Day in and day out I am working.<br>
......<br>
But I don't need any rest. This is My rest, and this is My joy and this is My work."<br>
