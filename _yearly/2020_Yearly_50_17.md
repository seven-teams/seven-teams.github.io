</p>

<p>
"Under these circumstance[s] Sahaja Yoga started. And there I find that the Powers of Ādi Śhakti are much greater than the problems you see. I saw it very clearly Myself: because these Powers are awakening the Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
......<br>
Actually, it is, again I say, your wisdom, your sense, your uh-uh-uh your uh-uh-uh seeking has brought you to Sahaj Yoga.<br>
......<br>
But without doing all that, you see, how we have managed this en masse Real... uh-uh-uhh Kuṇḍalinī awakening, by which people started understanding Sahaja Yoga, it started penetrating into them.<br>
......<br>
Only thing that is needed: is the meditation. In meditation you grow, in that spiritually you become higher. And when that happens, you start, in a way, I would say, that ... when you reach a state of that, I should say, maturity in Sahaja Yoga, then you do not to give up your meditation. Because that time you are absolutely One with Me."<br>
