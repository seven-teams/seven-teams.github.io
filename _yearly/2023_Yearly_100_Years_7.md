<font size="+2"><b>The Greatest Event Of All The Spiritual Happenings Of The Universe</b><br></font>
</p>

<p>
"Today, it's a great day for all of us, the seekers, that the last work of the Divine, of opening the last center in the Great Primordial Being, was done on the fifth of May nineteen seventy [1970].<br>
It is the greatest event of all the spiritual happenings of the Universe. It was done with very great care and great adjustments.<br>
It is not in the limits of human understanding, how things are worked in the Heavens.<br>
......<br>
Without this happening, there could not have been a possibility to give [en] masse Realization to people. One could have done it for one or two persons here and there, but to give such a [en] masse awakening could not have been possible.<br>
As you know, in the Sahasrāra there are the Seats of the seven main chakras. There are one thousand nāḍīs or, as they call it, flames, and they all have each Sixteen Thousand Powers. Every nāḍī deals with a particular type of a person, and, with the permutations and combinations of all these nāḍīs, human beings are looked after.<br>
As soon as Sahasrāra was opened, the whole atmosphere was filled with tremendous Chaitanya. And there was tremendous light in the sky. And the whole thing came on this Earth, as if a torrential rain, or a waterfall, with such a tremendous force, as if I was unaware, and got stupefied. The happening was so unexpected and so tremendous that I was stunned, and I became completely silent at its-ss grandeur. I saw the Primordial Kuṇḍalinī rising like a ... like a big furnace. And the furnace was very silent, but burning uh-uh-uh appearance it had. As if you heat up some metal, and it has many colors, in the same way, the Kuṇḍalinī showed up like a huge furnace, say of a, I can say, uh of a furnace which is like a tunnel, uh-uh-uh where you see these uh ... plants uh you have for a coal uh-uh-uh burning ... to create electricity. And it stretched, like a telescope, one after another, it came out: tchue, tchue, tchue, like that. And the Deities-s came and sat on Their Seats, on Their Golden Seats, and then They lifted the whole of the head, like a big dome, and opened it. And then this torrential rain completely drenched Me. And I started seeing all that, and got lost into the Joy. Is like an artist seeing its own creation fulfilled, I felt the joy of great fulfillment.<br>
After coming out of that beautiful experience, I looked around and I saw human beings so blind, and I became absolutely silent.<br>
Then I desired that I should get the cups to fill this Nectar, but I saw all stones."<br>
