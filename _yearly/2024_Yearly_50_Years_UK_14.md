"What is there to argue in Sahaja Yoga? You have to take, that's the point is, you have to take, there's nothing to argue. How much you take is the point.<br>
......<br>
Now, today tell your mind to rest for a while. Tell your thoughts to stop for a while, and receive, receive more of it. Everybody has benefited by this reception but you have to receive more. There's a capacity within you to receive.<br>
......<br>
There's another beautiful gesture I have seen, in Uzbekistan [in July], is very good. They put both the hands on their heart like this [show it], and just press it, bending their head, asking. See, [it] creates a vacuum. That's how they bow. [Ten seconds of silence.] Is beautiful!<br>
......<br>
In the Devī Bhāgavatapurāṇa it is written that the, "Pūjā to the Ādi Śhakti is the greatest Pūjā that can be done by any being."<br>
......<br>
Why these twenty-one names are taken, before every Pūjā? Even before the re-renovation of it, first you have to worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha. But even before worshiping, why these names are taken is important to understand. Everything has a why. Because these are the twenty-one channels within your Suṣhumṇā, twenty-one channels, we should say, in this complete Iḍā, Piṅgalā and Suṣhumṇā nāḍī. So, to raise you, [silence] absolutely to give you the ascent, twenty-one channels in Iḍā, Piṅgalā, Suṣhumṇā. So one would say seven channels in the Suṣhumṇā nāḍī. But these seven channels are divided, multiplied by, seven into three. So, every channel has got twenty-one inner channels. So, Suṣhumṇā nāḍī has got also twenty-one channels."<br>
