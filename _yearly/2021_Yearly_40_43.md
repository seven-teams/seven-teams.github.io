"Is your sensibility which is going to make a happy married life.<br>
......<br>
If you love the husband, that's how the domination is. Is the best way is to love your hus[b]and, look after him, do whatever is needed, because no use showing off that you are from a better society or a better culture or a better family background.<br>
......<br>
So, it's only the wife who makes or spoils the marriage.<br>
......<br>
Whatever he says you should agree, and listen to him.<br>
......<br>
This is one thing we should understand: that many marriages are broken because of domination.<br>
......<br>
So, second thing is that you should not be money-oriented, but you should be love-oriented.<br>
......<br>
So, you must change that attitude: that, 'We don't want anything. We have everything, we are Sahaja Yogis, we are absolutely satisfied.'<br>
......<br>
And none of your family people eh are more important than your husband. That is very important. For you now, the most important thing [is] your husband. This is a Sahaj style of marriage.<br>
......<br>
I hope you understand that you are marrying in Sahaja Yoga.<br>
And you have to keep the prestige of Sahaja Yoga. All right? You all promise that?"<br>

<p>
"I'm very happy that you all have a decided to marry in Sahaja Yoga.<br>
......<br>
You are marrying in Sahaja Yoga because, 'We want to strengthen Sahaja Yoga.'<br>
......<br>
But once you divorce in Sahaja Yoga, we will never marry you again, this we have decided now.<br>
Or, in any way, if you desert your wife or leave her or do something irresponsible about your marriage, in Sahaja Yoga you have no place.<br> 
So, once for all, now only you decide: that you are marrying, it's a very, very big responsibility.<br>
We want Sahaja Yoga marriages to be very successful, and all of you should enjoy a very happy married life.<br>
......<br>
But if you are marrying, you are taking the responsibility of the wife. She is the daughter of somebody, and them [the] father is giving the daughter to you.<br>
So, so far boys have behaved very well, I must say, in Sahaja Yoga.<br>
And so now, you should also have wisdom and understanding that you are here to produce Sahaja Yogi children, to help in Sahaja Yoga, because we have to change the world. It's to be emancipated.<br>
......<br>
So, I have to make a very great respect, with great respect I have to make a very humble, uh I should say, request to you, that, please, please, if you are entering into a married life in Sahaja Yoga, you have to understand your responsibility. It's a very great responsibility. It's a responsibility for the whole world! Because we have to change the whole world.<br>
......
But if you are marrying in Sahaja Yoga, you have to know it's a big battle against evil, against injustice, and also against all kind of mismanagements. We want to make a beautiful world. And to make a beautiful world, we need people who are beautiful, who themselves respect everyone."<br>
