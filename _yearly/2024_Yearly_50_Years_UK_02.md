"Now I always enjoyed Hampstead. Because, as I have told you, in London, many people who were great spiritual[s] lived in this area. They preferred it to other places. So, I believe that many people who live in this area must be also spiritual, must have taken their birth with the idea of achieving their Self-realization.<br>
......<br>
Then why not grow? When are we going to grow? When are we going to become fully that? Time is very short, My children. Time is very, very short. Believe Me!<br>
......<br>
So, one has to understand that, unless and until we develop that basic humility within ourselves, we are not going to do very well in England. It's for all the Sahaja Yogis as well as for people who have come here.<br>
It's a very, very, serious problem, and you are placed in the most vital parts of the universe, that is, this England, that's the Heart!<br>
And if you now, any way, escape your responsibility, you will be held responsible. I am telling you now very strongly! Because today I had big lectures from people saying that, "Mother, You don't say things strongly, and people are to be frightened." I don't's want to frighten you, but you will be held responsible, take it from Me. You are born on this Earth, on this great land for a very great purpose: to create Jerusalem out of this. And now if you run, not going to stand up, you'll be held responsible.<br>
This is what it is. It's a tremendous work one has to do, for which you must prepare yourself. Get to it. I can give Realization, that's all. But I can't give you strength. I mean, you can't make the horse stand up on his four legs, can you?<br>
......<br>
I want you to grow. Not because I want, but Divine wants it. The whole Creation wants it. Otherwise it will have no meaning.<br>
So the responsibility of English Sahaja Yogis, British Sahaja Yogis is very great. Again and again I have requested you and I have told you in whatever way possible, that [you] establish yourself."<br>
