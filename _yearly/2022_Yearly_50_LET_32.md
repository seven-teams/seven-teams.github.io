"We have to understand that we have risen above our human awareness. And, at that level, we were different, and at this new awareness we are different people. And all our priorities must change. Our value system has to change.<br>
.......<br>
And no more of all the falsehood of human awareness should be attached to us, or we should be bothered about it.<br>
......<br>
Your property is your Spirit. And your priorities are: where you can manifest your Spirit and can feel the Spirit of others.<br>
......<br>
But now the time has come for you to enjoy Sahaja Yoga. You have so many friends, you have so many relations, you have the complete uh-uh-uh ... group, such a big group, which may, can be called as a religion, which is with you, so you don't suffer at all. You just enjoy all the time.<br>
......<br>
Once you realize that, such a person becomes extremely humble, extremely conducive, and he can articulate, in a very beautiful manner, with other people, and you never feel that he is your boss but you feel he is your father. He's looking after you, with love and affection. But in that love there's no expectation at all, except that of giving.<br>
And this giving is the most beautiful thing Sahaja Yogis can do."<br>
