"We have heard about Truth many a times, that people have said that, ``God is Love and God is Truth." If that is so, then Love has to be the Truth.<br>
Now the problem of today, everywhere, all over the world, is only very simple, can be brought to one little point, can be said ... [after 11 seconds:] that there is a moral crisis: complete moral crisis in the whole world. What is the reason for this kind of a crisis? We should go into the causes of that. The cause of this crisis is: that we have lost our sustainance [sustenance].<br>
......<br>
Our evolution has stopped, at a point, now, when we are really going in a linear way towards destruction, whatever may be your government, whatever may be the style of your government, whatever may be your thinking and intellectualisms. What you have to do: is to build up a sustainance [sustenance] within you by which you rise higher, jump onto a higher level of awareness, a higher level of consciousness, which will give you that understanding of each other.<br> 
......<br>
Now, if this center can be awakened, one can become tremendously, tremendously creative. And the creativity it is managed by wisdom, which has a universal, universal support behind it. Because [turning and touching the sacrum bone on the Chakra Chart:] when the Kuṇḍalinī rises, [sliding upwards Her left middle finger along the central channel of the Chakra Chart:] She touches that [pointing to the Sahasrāra chakra on the Chakra Chart:] Universal Point, and the light [sliding down:] came [from the] Universality flows into your creativity, and you create tremendous thing, just like I would say uh, if you have seen the Sistine Chapel of Michelangelo. Because Michelangelo was a realized Soul.<br> 
......<br>
So,  this center, which is very important, is the center of innocence. And that is within us. And this center, if it is neglected, we really reduce most of our sustainance [sustenance] part. If innocence is attacked, then our sustainance [sustenance] is lost. This is the most important thing that we have, the greatest property within us: is the innocence.<br>
But all effort is made, by all so-called advancements we are doing, is to destroy this innocence.<br>
And once you start destroying this innocence, a person becomes immune. He doesn't feel. He loses the sensitivity, even to Divinity and to greatness."<br>
