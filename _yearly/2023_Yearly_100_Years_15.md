"Not easy to understand Sahaj Yog, very difficult.<br>
To understand Me is even worse. [Laughter.] Because, you know, I'm Mahāmāyā.<br>
......<br>
So, tomorrow I'm going to tell you something which you have take ... you have to take with a very receptive mind. Ah, something very special. But you have to have a very receptive mind. If you are very conditioned, or your ego is there, which may be difficult.<br>
But Truth has to be told sometime. And i... if Truth is not accepted, it will express itself, but it will destroy many things. So best thing is to accept the Truth as it is.<br>
Accept it. Put it in your heart. Is a fact.<br>
......<br>
So tonight, before sleeping, you must pray, that you should be able to accept the Great Truth that I'm going to tell tomorrow."<br>
