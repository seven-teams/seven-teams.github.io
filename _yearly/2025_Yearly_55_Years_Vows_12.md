"So, in that reflection that you are Me, in that rekflection [reflection] that the Mother Earth is Me, in that beautiful creation within you, you have to become very sensitive to the need of the world, what is the need of the world. Today, if you fail, the whole thing will fail forever. Only very few will be there. So the need for you is: to s-spread Sahaja Yoga because this love is not only for you, is not to be enjoyed [only] by you, but is to be enjoyed by as many possible in the whole world.<br>
So, today we have to decide that, as the children of Ādi Śhakti, we have to go all out. Everywhere, every corner, we have to shout and we have to tell loudly what is the time in which we are living and what is the responsibility that you have to fulfill as Sahaja Yogis.<br>
......<br>
It is rather, rather difficult for Me to say something forcefully. That's not My nature, you know. Can't get into tempers, I cannot get angry. And I cannot forcefully say something to you, but, if you fail, then [the] only thing will be: that you have failed Me completely. It means that, nothing less than that.<br>
And if you don't want to do it, then I would request all of you to take a vow today that, 'We'll spread Sahaja Yoga and we'll talk about Sahaja Yoga, know about Sahaj Yog.'<br>
There are many who don't know anything! Also, it's very surprising: they are Sahaja Yogis, they don't know anything.<br>
And don't create problems for Me, like marriage: 'We can't now live with the wife,' 'We can't live with the husband.' All sorts of nonsensical problems people create for Me in Sahaja Yoga. Are you here to create problems or to remove problems of people?<br>
