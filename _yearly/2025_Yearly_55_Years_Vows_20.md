"In the chakra it is decided: what is to be stored there, what is to be done. All the decisions take place in the chakras.<br>
Now, who takes the decisions? Is the Deity there.<br>
......<br>
Only thing you people, all of you, should decide about yourself to make yourself strong [<font color="orange">unclear</font> the rest/best]. Each one of you. Don't depend on others! Yourself. On no [one]. And then it will work out."<br>
