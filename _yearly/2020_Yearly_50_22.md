"Without the left side, right side is very dangerous. If you uh don't have right side, of course, it's a big dangerous thing also. But first you must have development of your left side. That is what, to begin with, we had in Sahaja Yoga.<br>
Left side is compassion, is love, universal feeling. Or we can say it's the blessings of the Devī which are described, you know as in the Devī Māhātmyam, that a Goddess resides within you as so many things: She resides in you as śhraddhā, as She resides in you as sleep, She resides in you as illusion, bhrānti. All kinds of things are there on the left-hand side, which are already described.<br>
And when I told you about Sahaja Yoga, I wanted to make your left side very strong.<br>
......<br>
That means: Sahaja Yogis can also become right-sided, but like Christ. Otherwise if they are right-sided: they'll organize, they'll do all kinds of things and have problems of the right side. That's why I want you to avoid the right side.<br>
But once you are fully a left-sided master of Sahaja Yoga, then it's very, very much needed to be a Complete Personality of spirituality, that you should take to right side movement. And what is the right side movement: is the collectivity.<br>
......<br>
Such a detached person is the one who can work it out all kinds of propagation of Sahaja Yoga. Today that is the greatest need of the world: that we have to have more Sahaja Yogis.<br>
......<br>
Go all out to preach, think, make people otherstand ... understand about Sahaj Yog in every way that is possible, and I think, then, you will become complete as gurus. If Sahaja Yoga is just with you, you cannot be a guru. Guru also doesn't mean that you go on preaching about Sahaja Yoga, talking about pra Sahaja Yoga, giving lectures about Sahaja Yoga, no! It means the one who gives Realizations to others."<br>
