"So, you see, in the generosity is the only way we can correct corruption. When you s... start enjoying giving, you don't grab. And such a person has na ... no reputation in the society and that money that he has grabbed is of no use. And all those people who have made money like that have lost it because they have put it [laughing:] in the ... in this Swiss Bank. And the Swiss Bank also doesn't avail of it.<br>
