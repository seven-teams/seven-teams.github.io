</p>

<p>
"So we come to [a] position to understand that all those people who talk of these Great Incarnations, and profess a religion, are all hypocrites. There's no religion there. [There are] simple people who believe these hypocrites because they are so simple, so innocent. These cunning, greedy devils, who started these religions, exploited these simple people, used them for making temples, churches, mosques. They have no religion within them, how can they talk of God? Their life is so impure!<br>
So, we had to start our own innate religion, our own spontaneous, natural religion which is the human religion, which is the Vishwa Nirmala Dharm: the one that will give you the inner ascent, not just talk, no hypocrisy. And all that which goes with religion to malign the names of these Great Incarnations has to be brought to the light for the people to see this nonsense that has been eating into our societies, eating into our families, eating into our children, has to go away.<br>
"Yadā yadā hi dharmasya" [Bhagavad Gītā 4.7, first half of line 1], "Whenever the religion" -- dharma doesn't mean this nonsensical religion -- "falls down, that time," "Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṃ" [Bhagavad Gītā 4.8, first half of line 1], "to save the Sādhus," the seekers, "Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṃ vināśhāya cha duṣhkṛutām" [Bhagavad Gītā 4.8, line 1], "and to destroy all these devils, I take My birth again and again." "Saṃbhavāmi" uhge ... "yuge yuge": "Every yuga I take My birth." And this is what is an Incarnation.<br>
You must be very fortunate people that now you can see the cunning of all these devils and can exist into that purity, into that benevolence, the hita, which was promised by Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa."<br>
