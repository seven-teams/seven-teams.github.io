<p>
Like, if Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa had not come we would not have known really the significance of spiritual life. He was the first who talked of spiritual life."<br>
......<br>
Saṃsthāpanārthāya. He ... He comes on this Earth again to establish the Religion. But not only religion but Vishwa Nirmal Dharm, which is a much higher religion than the ordinary religion of human beings. Within themselves is the Vishwa Nirmal Dharma we'll establish in a very short time, I'm sure, on this Earth."<br>
