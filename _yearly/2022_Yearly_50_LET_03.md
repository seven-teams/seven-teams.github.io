<p>
"So, you don't have to put in any effort. This is what meditation is. Medis-tation [meditation] means: exposing yourself to God's Grace.<br>
......<br>
Effortlessness is the only way to meditation.<br>
But you should not be lethargic about it: you should be alert and watch it.<br>
......<br>
And you try to put your attention to Me, within yourself, if you can, to My Kuṇḍalinī if you can. You can come into My Kuṇḍalinī, it will be done, good. Just like this. The hands should be like this, straight.<br>
So, effortlessness is the key word, absolutely effortlessly, whether you are meditating before Me, or before My Photograph."<br>
