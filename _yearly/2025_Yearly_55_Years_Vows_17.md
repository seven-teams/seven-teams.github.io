"You have to meditate. With that you go deeper and deeper.<br>
Today I want you to give Me a promise, a present to Me: that, you take oath that you will now take up jobs and you will meditate and become deeper Sahaja Yogis. And also, that you'll spread Sahaja Yoga.<br>
Everyone can get thousands Sahaja Yogis.<br>
Because you do not meditate, you do not have the depth to show that you are great peo... people.<br>
All kinds of mistakes people make here."<br>
