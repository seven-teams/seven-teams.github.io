"Today is a great day for all of us to be jubilant that the Primordial Being Himself incarnated on this Earth as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br>
So many aspects, of His being, have been described in so many of My lectures to you all. But the greatest on greatest of all the aspect[s] of this Primordial Being was that: He was the Yogeśhwara. He was the God of Yoga -- Yogeśhwara. He was the Lord of our Union with the Divine.<br>
Without His permission, or without His sanction, we cannot be Sahaja Yogis. <br>
......<br>
So, to worship Yogeśhwara, we must know that our relationships with everyone in this world has [have] to be pure.<br>
......<br>
And I would say that on this day, let us take one vow: ...<br>
...... ... to decide that we will be worshiping Yogeśhwara.<br>
We have to worship Him. Means: our relationships about these things has [have] to be cleaned.<br>
We should not get involved into, it's nothing important.<br>
......<br>
What do [does] happen, when you worship? You surrender all that is not liked by Me. In the fire, in the water, outside, in the elements you throw them away. And you bring to Me your heart. That's what is worshiping is."<br>
