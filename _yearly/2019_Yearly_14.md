"Then this Power of Love changes the whole atmosphere. In the family people see how sacrificing you are and how noble you are. This nobility is seen very clearly among Sahaja Yogis. In that noble understanding of life they try to be extremely patient, sweet in the family and try to bring them to the right path.
……
This Power of Love is the Greatest Power and after Sahaja Yoga we have to use only our Power of Love. It’s the most powerful, effective weapon that we have. Because this is Divine Love. We are getting the Source of Divine Love from the All-pervading Power of God’s Love."<br>
