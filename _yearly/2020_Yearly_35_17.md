<p>
"You see, religion is logical. It is not absurd, it is not nonsense. It is the greatest sense. But we should understand how these things have been brought in.<br>
So the idea of Qiyāmah was ruined, I think, by Paul, first to begin with, and these people must have taken from there, something of that, because it's an absurd idea.<br>
On the contrary, as Muhammad Sāhab has said, "There had been one lākh of Walīs," means have been Incarnations before.<br>
So, the idea of Qiyāmah in the Indian Scripture is much more sensible in a way. Because it says that, 'All the souls which are dead, which are hanging in different states, will take birth when the Qiyāmah time will come, when the Last Judgment will come.' And it's happening. <br>
......<br>
Now, he's asked Me a very nice question: "What is Your religion now?" To be very frank, My religion is a Universal Religion. This is the religion that Gāndhījī, Mahātmā Gāndhī preached. That we don't only respect, but we worship. We worship Muhammad Sāhab, Hazarat ʿAlī, Fāṭimah Bi, all of Them. Worship! Also, we worship Christ, we worship Moses. Also, we worship Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa and Śhrī Rām. Because They are all flowers of the same Tree of Spirituality. At different times They came.<br>
So what we've done: we have plucked the flowers. Plucked the flowers, and we are fighting with the dead flowers.<br>
......<br>
So, we believe in a Universal Pure Religion, which is within ourselves.<br>
......<br>
But after Realization, you become really a real Muslim, you become a real Christian and real Hindu. Because you just don't do wrong things. You become righteous. It is the becoming! You become religious. We have religion, our religion is outside, absolutely outside, but it becomes inside, innately.<br>
So, this is the Innate Universal Religion, which is Purer ... Pure Religion we follow, and we respect every one of them. "<br>
