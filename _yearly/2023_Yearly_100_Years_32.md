<font size="+2"><b>The Purity Should Be Such That It Should Purify</b><br></font>
</p>

<p>
"Now, the brothers' and sisters' relationship has to be very, very strong. And the purity of that relationship is to be maintained. Is not necessary that you should be born as brothers and sisters, not necessary. But you are born, because if you are realized Souls you are born as brothers and sisters. So that purity must be maintained in the society of Sahaja Yoga. Very important it is. That we should try to develop this situation that brothers and sisters are something very pure. Their relationships are very pure. And they should not be at all challenged.<br>
......<br>
So first of all you'll be pure yourself and you'll accept purity, you'll appreciate puricy ... -ty [purity], [you'll be] sustained by purity. Any impurity will not collaborate with you or try to compromise with.<br>
That's why purity is your Mother's name. You know that My name is purity.<br>
And this purity is such that it pures [purifies] everything. It just purifies. The purity should be such that it should purify.<br>
Otherwise that purity has no meaning!"<br>
