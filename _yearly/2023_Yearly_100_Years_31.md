<p>
"So's today we are here to enjoy our joy. Our Ātmānanda, Nirānand and Paramānanda, all these we are here to enjoy, which are of eternal value.<br>
......<br>
So when you have joy, you have to be joy-giving. And if you are not joy-giving, that means there's something lacking in your Sahaja Yoga and that's why we have to come up now. We have to become Sahaja Yoginīs and Sahaja Yogis. That is joy-giving society. We can change our name, if you like, if not Sahaja Yoga is good: `Joy-giving Association'. [Laughter, laughs, applause.] <br>
......<br>
Gradually, you'll be surprised, only if you try, in your life, in your relationships, in your endeavors, to give light to others, to make their lives-ss better, not to show off, not to be egotistical, but in a very loving, beautiful manner, you'll really understand that you are the Spirit. Because Spirit loves. It loves. <br>
......<br>
So, you have to first understand that: life is for giving joy to others, because you are now Saints and your light has to give Joy."<br>
