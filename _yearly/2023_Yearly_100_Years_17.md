<p>
"Today, we are all going to worship Me, first time. It has been always the Pūjā of [an] aspect of Me or a part of Me.<br>
......<br>
So now, Ādi Śhakti had to assert, put the complete force-s-s.<br>
So, the first thing She realized, that one should know what is a family.<br>
......<br>
Under this circumstance, Sahaja Yoga started. And there I find: that, the Powers of Ādi Śhakti are much greater than the problems you see. I saw it very clearly Myself. Because these Powers are awakening the Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
......<br>
If you are not meditating, then I have no relationship with you.<br>
......<br>
In the beginning of course the meditation take some time. But once you will know what is meditation is, how you enjoy My company, how you are one with Me, how we can have a rapport with each other, there's no need to have anything else in between like writing letters or maybe some sort of a special connection, nothing of that kind. Only thing that is needed: is the meditation.<br>
In meditation you grow, in that spiritually you become higher.<br>
And when that happens, you start, in a way, I would say, that ... when you reach a state of that, I should say, maturity in Sahaja Yoga, then you don't want to give up your meditation. Because that time you are absolutely One with Me.<br> 
......<br>
First it will be difficult, but after some time you will know that this connection that you have with Śhrī Mātājī is the only connection that you are looking out for."<br>
