</p>

<p>
"First of all, a Sahaja Yogi which is on in the foundation doesn't show up. He bears, he holds. He is the ... actually the Ādhāra, as they say, the Support: the complete support of Sahaja Yoga in a country.<br>
......<br>
And the rest of them, out of them also, those who were really solid people, could form the foundation of Sahaja Yoga.<br>
......<br>
Because it's a big struggle in the beginning to implement Sahaj Yog.<br>
......<br>
So there are two forces always working in Sahaja Yoga: one is the centripetal, another is centrifugal. By one [centripetal] force, people are attracted towards Sahaja Yoga, because they know is the Truth, and this is the end of their seeking, and this they have to have, because they find out through their pure intelligence that this is the way.
......<br>
As it is, you know, Sahaja Yoga is a living process and it goes both ... grows both, both ways: upwards and downwards. In the beginning it grows more downwards. And in the downwards process, we have to depend on our vibrations very much.<br>
......<br>
So, is best is: to keep to your uh Sahaj Yog meditation, keep to your own understanding, know your Self, that is the best way."<br>
