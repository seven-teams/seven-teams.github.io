<p>
"So with the Lakṣhmī, you must have your morality intact.<br>

In a country like, now say, America and all such people, there are horrible films coming, and people are taking to the signs we call it alakṣhmī.<br>

A person who has Lakṣhmī should dress up in a decent manner, women and men. I find on the street women walking with very short uh clothes [laughs]. With that, what will happen your Nābhī chakra will be caught and you will have problems with money.<br>

So the wealth that you have should be seen in your temperament, in your nature, in your behavior, in your living.<br>

Moreover, the person who has Lakṣhmī has to be a very humble man. For example, Śhrī Lakṣhmī is standing on a lotus. Lotus is the lightest flower you could think because it floats [laughing:] over the water. So, her temperament should be not of a very serious type but of a very mirthful ... And she should, she, she doesn't show off, because is such a simple thing like a lotus to stand on that."<br>
