</p>

<p>
"So must, one must know the first, first duty of every Sahaja Yogi now is to save others: to talk about Sahaja Yoga, to work out Sahaja Yoga in different places.<br>
......<br>
It is a country which can definitely help for the emancipation of the whole human beings. But on the contrary, it is uh going on the other way round. I mean, American culture, I don't understand at all what, what is the American culture i[s]. Is um something -- they say something, do something else. They've no proper value system, which is accepted by everyone, which is built traditionally from days together. The value system is so convoluted, so twisted that it's only a Sahaja Yogi by his nobility, by his greatness can disentangle these people. They have funny ideas, and those funny ideas should not deter you, should not stop you, for you know that they are stupid, they are destructive and they will destroy all the, all the good qualities.<br>
You should know that their responsibility of Americans is much greater than the responsibility of any other Sahaja Yogis, because they are accepted and regarded as the most competent people, as the most effective people, by the Divine Power. Divine Power thinks that, `Now you can go all ahead, you can do so much, and let us see.' Like we have the power and the machinery, but the machinery if it doesn't work, what's the use of the power? It is useless. So the machinery has to work. And it is working, it is spreading, but we have to double our efforts.<br>
......<br>
It's your personal behavior, your collective behavior, your national behavior, all are going to change the atmosphere which is supposed to be superficial, so that that also becomes subtler.<br>
......<br>
Is true that all this universe was created, everything was created, and then you were created, and all that is done. But the greatest thing this Power has done is to create Sahaja Yogis. This is the greatest thing. Those who have knowledge, those who have the Pure Knowledge, and those who have the Divine Love in their heart, what a tremendous personality it is! Just think of that, and you will get all these opportunities to express that love."<br>
