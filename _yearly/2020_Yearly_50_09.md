"...... that Sahaja Yoga is first to start your germination. Then it grows. In that growth, you have to become a wider personality and a wider personality. With the marriage you become even a better person, and you develop a better personality.<br>
Now, why marriage is necessary for Sahaja Yogis? First and foremost thing, it is the most normal thing to do, is to marry. Uh ... God has given you this desire to be married for some purpose. But the same desire, if you do not use it for the purpose it is given, it can become a perversion, can become a nasty thing, is can be very detrimental to your growth. So one should understand this desire within us to have a marriage.<br>
Marriage means a wife who is a part and parcel of your being, a wife on whom you can depend. She's your mother, she's your sister, she's your child, she's everything. You can share all your feelings with your wife. So it is i... important that the wife should be such, that she should understand that this is the need of a marriage.<br>
Now, in Sahaja Yoga, as you have seen, all of you have problems either of the left or the right. Now, when these marriages will take place, mostly spontaneously, it will happen by the Nature's Plan itself that you will marry a person who is a complementary personality to you. Because, supposing you are a left-sided person, and if you have a person who has a left side which is very strong, it will compensate. And that's how you'll make a good marriage. 
......<br>
But in Sahaja Yoga, is little more, I think quite a lot more, much more. Here you have to share the community. The marriage is not for individuals, in Sahaj Yog, not at all. If anybody has this feeling that the marriage is between two persons in Sahaja Yoga, is a wrong thing. It is two community [communities], it can be two nations, it can be completely two universes. So, it is not to be enjoyed between yourself. If you are a good husband-wife to each other is not sufficient in Sahaj Yog. That love should be enjoyed by everybody else, in the society, in the community. If you cannot do that, then you have not achieved Sahaja Yoga marriage."<br>
