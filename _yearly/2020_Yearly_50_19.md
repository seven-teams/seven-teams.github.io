"For that, Ādi Śhakti's ascent is important within you, which is your Kuṇḍalinī. And when this thing takes place, automatically you drop all those six enemies that you have. You become a beautiful human being.<br>
Like lotus, when it is in the very germinating state, it looks like all other small animals, or small, you can say, very-very, small dirty things that are in the pond. And then, once it starts coming out, coming out of that horrible water, it becomes such a beautiful flower, rises up and opens out. In the same way, a Sahaja Yogi, though [he] lives along with all these horrible things that are going on, but flowers like a lotus. It doesn't have all these insects, all this dirt and filth of that water in which it lives. It sucks only the pure water and the rem[n]ant ... re... the others remain there as it is.<br>
So what is left within you is nothing but purity, beauty and fragrance, just like a lotus. Then there is no more the problem of getting attacked by all the [of] these small, small creatures in the water, uh all the dirty things that are in the water.<br> 
And this state that you have achieved now, I'm very happy to see so many people in America have achieved it. You see, it's a very great blessing, because America is the leading country in so many ways. One can say that it has made lots of money. That is not the criteria or [of] becoming a very good Sahaja Yogi. What you get is the satisfaction: satisfaction that you enjoy whatever you have and whatever others have.<br>
......<br>
As a politicians, they are horrible, as they say. Why? Because they have no emotional intelligence. Also, as administrators, they are very much difficult, because they have no emotional intelligence. All these people are devoid of that great quality of emotional intelligence. If your country is very progressive, I must say, you must progress in emotional intelligence. 
......<br>
You are Sahaja Yogis! You have to send waves of emotional intelligence. You have to send love to all over the world. You have to show how you can, with love, win over.<br>
......<br>
I know some people grow very fast, but some don't, because they lack this balance between emotion and intelligence. This balance has to be completely established. And I know, one day, this America will lead so many people, so many people, thousands, in Sahaja Yoga."<br>
