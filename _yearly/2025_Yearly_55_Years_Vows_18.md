"But there was one person who could not leave it. One day he came to Me and said, "Mother, I don't understand, whenever I sit for meditation, my face bloats up like the face of Hanumāna."<br>
Hanumānji is a very jovial Deity, and His ways are so hilarious.<br>
I said, "Really?" He said, "Yes. I feel I am looking like Hanumānjī, You please cure me. What is happening to me in Sahaja Yoga?" I said, "Do you take tobacco?" He said, "How do You know?" I said, "That is why, if you are seeing Hanumānjī, I understood, these are all His tricks. You just now hold your ears and ask for forgiveness. Also promise Me, everything will be all right." "<br>

And I've been always insisting on him for helping Shastrijī because I knew what he was. I had the image of a man who would do such revolution in this country and bring down people to higher values in. Not money, money, money, money business, no! To the higher values. Because he was a[n] evolved soul, himself a detached man, and what a caliber of intelligence he had!"<br>
