"But keep your minds open because it's a revolution. Is not just a pendulum that from comfort you are coming to discomfort. One thing you have to realize it has nothing to do like an anti-culture stuff. You have come here to jump into ss ... your subtler and subtler sensitivities. So the grosser senti ... sensitivities must be neglected and negated, so that you can feel your subtler sensitivities. Once you start understanding this basic principle of enjoying here, I'm sure the whole venture will be extremely fruitful.<br>
Because all over the world we realize that Sahaja Yoga is the only way for human emancipation. Is the only way we are going to transform this world into a beautiful place. For that, we have to get into a pop ... proper understanding geared up, absolutely like soldiers into a disciplined life, so that whatever we want to do we can do in our optimum capacities.<br>
......<br>
We have to show to this world that it's only the Spirit that can save the world, nothing else."<br>
