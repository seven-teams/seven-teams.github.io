"In Sahaja Yoga, the Guru Pūjā has a very different significant from any other guru pūjā. When you worship your Guru, you are also worshiping the Guru within you. This is not in any other guru-disciple system, because, in you, the Guru, the Master, has been awakened. And so, when you are worshiping your Guru, then this Master within you is also worshiped, you respect it, you glorify it, you awaken it, and you manifest it.<br>
This, we have to realize: that, in Sahaja Yoga, if you are a Sahaja Yogi.<br>
Now the quality of guru, first and foremost is: that he makes you meet God. Means: he raises the Kuṇḍalinī, and establish the relation between the All-pervading Power.<br>
And, as your Guru is Ādi Śhakti, you make that person meet, also, the Ādi Śhakti.<br>
So you have a double advantage. That, at the same time, when you give them Realization, not only that you make them feel the Union with the Divine Power, but you can make them meet the Divinity Itself, the Source of Divine Power.<br>
So your responsibility as Sahaja Yogis is very great because in you is ... there is the Guru.<br>
Now we in our mantras we say that: 'Mother, I am my own guru.' But, saying that, do we realize, that, "If I am ah ... my own guru, this 'I' and 'my guru', between the two, what have I achieved? Where am I? Can I guide myself? Have I got the light of the Spirit on my attention, so well established and manifested, that I can guide myself and guide others later on?"<br>
First of all, the ... in the Guru Principle it is important, that you see to yourself the introspection: 'Can I be my own guru? Have I become my own guru?'
......<br>
First of all, the quality of a person who has dharma is: that he listens to others, he obeys.<br>
......<br>
The basic thing is humility.<br>
......<br>
Now, for a Guru, as you have seen, that, in My own ... ownway, in My own image, you have to come up.<br>
First of all, your life should be absolutely transparent. Transparency is the essence of Sahaja Yoga.<br>
......<br>
So the food part of it is āswāda. You should not have any taste for any special food.<br>
......<br>
So, the eating of good food is a kind of a[n] addiction. It's a kind of an addiction, it's something like drug: that you must have good food.<br>
......<br>
So this is the second point is that: we have to uh-uh-uh give up body k... comfort.<br>
But the third point where I think the Western people falter is uh their materialistic attitude. Materialistic attitude and their fondness of their eyes.<br>
......<br> 
So this madness of antique has to go away from our minds."<br>

<b>Objectives:</b><br>
4. To open the minds of people through meetings introducing "thoughtless awareness" which discovers the subtle which at present is lost in gross words, books and dogmas.<br>
5. To introduce the only one internal living religion lying dead and camouflaged under external practices and precepts of religion in all the human beings and for this to organize tours and hold spiritual meetings as per wishes of Mātājī.<br>
