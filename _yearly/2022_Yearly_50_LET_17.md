"Is such a pleasure to be in the Āśhram in San Diego. And it's such a beautiful place, so ek ... much expressing the Love of God, the Divine, the way It wants to help you at every step.<br>
If you want to have an Āśhram, if you want to have a proper place, you want to look after your children well, you want to do God's work, everything is looked after, everything has to be worked out. If it is not worked out, then how will you do your work? So, it all works out.<br>
And is so obvious, the way we have different Āśhrams, such comfortable places, at a very reasonable amount that we ... we can afford, that we can live happily together. This is the abode created by love for you.<br>
......<br>
So the first thing we have to remember: that among ourselves, we should have complete love. <br>
......<br>
We should not trust people who try to ... divide us, who try to give us wrong ideas.<br>
It's very easy to make out a person who is a Sahaja Yogi from the heart. It's very easy to make out. You have to be [a] little more sensitive and you'll find out such a person very easily. Whatever may be the cunning, it can be discovered. Nobody can act against God now, because everything will be discovered and will be found out. <br>
......<br>
This is the point: that we build up our images about Sahaja Yoga also. We cannot build up: it is what it is. We cannot build up our's image. That we think, 'Sahaj Yog should be like this,' 'Sahaj Yog should be like that,' it cannot be. You cannot compromise. You just cannot compromise. It has to be what it is. It cannot be anything that you want it to be. You cannot mold it, because it is fixed long time back.<br>
Now, it is what it is, and that is why it is working out so well, so ... so efficiently. But to make it more efficient, you have to accept its working.<br>
......<br>
And this is the main point where we feel that uh-uh-uh Sahaja Yogis have to learn to accept with joy, with happiness, and not to project nonsensical ideas. Then only you will find your joy will be complete. Otherwise it will not be.<br>
......<br>
So you all people should also understand: 'Don't try new things in Sahaja Yoga.' Sahaja Yoga is a traditionally built thing. 'Don't try anything new in Sahaja Yoga'. Whatever we have is more than sufficient. You don't try anything new. People who tried new things have jumped into problems. So. do not try something new. <br>
......<br>
So be careful! There is no need to try new methods.<br>
Now you have jumped on to that awareness where you have to just be steady. So don't try at this point something new! Just steady yourself! Steady yourself in balance, that's very important."<br>

<b>Objectives:</b><br>
2. To achieve the evolution described in the foregoing para through the method of "Sahaja Yoga" which means effortless, easy, relaxed method of meditation evolved by Mātājī. To organize meditation centers for this purpose. This completely precludes all the external human efforts like rituals, worships, prayers, recitations, reading, renunciation (i.e. saṃnyāsa), worship of the preceptor (Guru) or any other physical expressions.<br>
10. To build and run Ashramas of Sadhakas for their use during Sadhana and to promote all activities expressing the new dimensions of creativity.
