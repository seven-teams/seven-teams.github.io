<font size="+2"><b>Greatest Enemy Now We Have To Face Is Our Own Ego</b><br></font>
</p>

<p>
"It is such a great thing to be independent and free. The worst thing is the slavery.<br>
......<br>
As far as we are concerned in India, we have to know that this independence was granted to us through God's Grace. We have won it through nonviolence and truth. And [was] granted to us, for us to achieve our spiritual ascent, to become spiritually enlightened, and [to] find out from our root what Truth has been laid for us.<br>
Now, we have to judge within ourselves as Sahaja Yogis: `How much slavery is still there in our minds?' If somebody writes something, a Sahaja Yogi is not supposed to believe it. Because now he is bestowed with the blessings of his Kuṇḍalinī, he has his vibratory awareness to judge everything, and see for himself that whatever he is doing, he is doing in an absolute way.<br>
......<br>
In Sahaja Yoga, the greatest enemy, now, we have to face is our own ego.<br>
Even when they get Realization, even when they get vibrations, even when they are realized, they do not understand that it is all God's Grace that it has happened."<br>

<b>Objectives:</b><br>
3. ...... Ultimately to reach the stage where one loses the Ego and one becomes one with the Creator and His creation.<br>
6. To spread the news of the descent of the Divine Grace, with the help of self-realized disciples of Mātājī.
