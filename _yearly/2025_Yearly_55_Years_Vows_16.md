"Today, in the Presence of Śhrī Gaṇeśha, you have to take an oath, that, 'Whatever is the past of my country, I will get opposite to that!'<br>
......<br>
So, the second oath we have to take before Śhrī Gaṇeśha is: that, 'I will be honest to myself. I will not deceive myself, for anybody's sake!'<br>
......<br>
So, with the third oath you have to take: that, 'For us, our Mother is so powerful, why should we be afraid of anything‽ If She is going to give us the wisdom, why should we try to seek it anywhere else‽'<br>
......<br>
The another oath we have to take today: that, 'We'll respect every Sahaja Yogi from our heart, because they are made in the form of Śhrī Gaṇeśha. We'll not make fun of them. We'll not laugh at them.'<br>
As long as they are in Sahaja Yoga, we have to respect [them]. But they can be thrown away, they can get out of it.<br>
But unless and until this happens, do not put your ego on other people. Don't think that you understand everything. Don't think that you know everything.<br>
Respect each and every person. N... not to what he has read or for what he has learnt, but because he is a Great Soul."<br>
