</p>

<p>
"In Kali Yuga there is no greater method than Forgiveness. The larger the Power of Forgiveness the more powerful you will be. Forgive everyone. Only the one who is Big can forgive.<br>
......<br>
And dharma is nothing but love. And if love is everything then forgiveness becomes its part.<br>
How much can a person commit atrocities by seeing our love? How much evil can a person do, how much can another trouble you, upset you, let them. Everything will be washed away with love.<br>
This is the only way in Kali Yuga that works out. I can't understand any other way. If you think that there should be some old methods to use then it is not possible.<br>
There is only one reason which I have told you before and I am telling you again that there are no complete Saints or Sādhus in this world. In each Sādhu they have sent one, one rākṣhasa. They must gone into your attention. Have you understood?<br>
......<br>
To rise in dharma is the aim of Sahaja Yoga. There is no other aim. It is a straight calculation."<br>

<b>Objectives:</b><br>
3. By the process, to reach a Zero point where one becomes effortless and starts feeling the play of the supreme. Ultimately to reach the stage where one loses the Ego ( T ) and one becomes one with the Creator and His creation.<br>
9. To create a new generation of self-realized people and to render motherly protection to all such children against evil intentions and to look after their well-being.
