</p>

"It is such a great day today, that the French call ... got their liberation, [laughing:] and this day. [The French National Day, 1789-0714, is the anniversary of the Storming of the Bastille.]<br>
So, the liberation through anger, when it comes, hatred is the basis of these revolutions and these, so-called, achieved liberations.<br>
If the liberation takes place within yourself, so that you are no more [a] slave of any one of these horrible destructive forces and negative forces, then it's a real liberation.<br>
The second thing that has happened in France, first time in Europe, it has been recognized as dharma. It's a very big thing, and give a hand to it. [Applause.] It is recognized that Sahaja Yoga is Dharma. [Laughs.] It is! But today it was recognized. This is a very big thing.<br>
......<br>
But today, as Sahaja Yoga is established is dharma, we have to know about Śhrī Viṣhṇu, who is the Basis of Dharma.<br>
......<br>
So now, where is the dharma? Dharma is within. And that is why this Viṣhṇu Principle is to be awakened within yourself.<br> 
And this Principle then expands into many ways. Because Viṣhṇu is the One who is ... the One who cures. We call Him a Dhanvantari, means a doctor. He is the One who cures. Because: He is our preserver. He is the preserver of human beings. So if you preserve your dharma, then you don't get sick. And if you get sick, it is Viṣhṇu who will preserve, who will cure you. So, He is the One who is ah-ah ... we can call Dhanvantari: is a doctor.<br>
......<br>
This is the dharma, which you have accepted. I never told you anything, but you have accepted. And you have imbibed, and you are enjoying it.<br>
Now if they accept us as dharma, what is so special? We are the only dharma.<br>
The rest are all adharmīs. They call themselves dhārmik, [but] they have no dharma in them.<br>
Unless and until you have dharm by which you get a balance, wisdom, you cannot ascend.<br>
But if you ascend even without dharma, Sahaja Yoga is so great, I've seen, people who were quiet adhārmik and all that [snaping the right fingers:] just got Realization. If you ascend, then dharma trickles down: they become dhārmik.<br>
......<br>
So, for us [is] not difficult to establish Viṣhṇu Principle within us. But to recognize that we have those.<br>
You see, suddenly I find Sahaja Yogis become extremely humble, and they don't want to know what they have. You can cure people, you are a Dhanvantari. You can give Realization to people. All Viṣhṇu Principles are now awakened within you, and you must utilized. <br>
......<br>
But I think you should read the one thousand names of Viṣhṇu, [coughs] and you will know how many qualities you can have."<br>
