<font size="+2"><b>To Fight This Ego One Has To Be Prepared And Must Have Proper Willpower</b><br></font>
</p>

<p>
"Now, today I want to tell you about how ego has been [laughing:] historically, traditionally torturing people around. So you'll see the manifestation of this ego, and then you will know that if you are playing anything, any role, with your ego, you could be a part and parcel of that destructive force.<br>
......<br>
So to fight this ego one has to be prepared and must have proper willpower. Because ego kills the willpower of man, completely. A man who is an egoist is left with no willpower. He does what the ego tells him to do: it can murder people, it can be voilent [violent]. All the voilence [violence] in America is from the ego manifestation. Uh-uh-uh because there is no respect of the law, not of human laws, but not of God's Law also, that's how people behave, they incur diseases, horrible things.<br>
A person who is not egotistical will not get cancer. You have to be egotistical to get cancer! Though it's is a left-sided thing, but you have to have ego, vulnerability comes through ego, and then it acts. If you are egoistical, you are vulnerable to cancer.<br>
So first thing, if you survive from, say, cancer, you'll have the other one waiting, where you will be transfixed like this. [Laughter. Laughs.] [Laughing:] You will become like some of the things I see in the TV, where people are given some sort of an uh artificial thing and they are just nothing but uh-uh-uh machines, and they move their hands like machines, they walk like this. They loo... look like human beings, and they walk straight like this, they can't feel anything, like that you'll become. Because ego takes you away from emotions, and away from the left side, and you become really a person like a machine, you become like a machine."<br>
