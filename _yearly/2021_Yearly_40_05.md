<font size="+2"><b>Not To Be Collective Itself Is A Negativity</b><br></font>
</p>

<p>
"But today in the city of Vancouver, we have gathered here to pray for ... the country of Canada, and also for the Canadian people.<br>
Also, we have to know that there're lots of negative forces working, and there has to be some Pūjā to be done, to the Mahākālī Force. And so I thought today: 'Let's have the Pūjā for Mahākālī.'<br>
......<br>
And today's prayer should be, in our hearts, that, 'Let us uh get very powerful Gaṇeśha Śhakti. Let us get that.' And second should be that: 'This Śhakti should destroy all that is negativity.'<br>
Even not to be collective itself is a negativity. All these collectivity problems, or all these negativity problems, must be destroyed by this Mahākālī Power, which will manifest through us."<br>
