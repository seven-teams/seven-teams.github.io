<font size="+2"><b>You Actually Become Creative Under The Influence Of The Divine</b><br></font>
</p>

<p>
"<br>
The subject is very interesting, that, 'How Sahaja Yoga can help beauty?'<br>
......<br>
So, the first thing, I would say that when it happens, you don't react. You just watch, you become a witness: you become the witness of the whole thing.<br>
And when these things happen, then the creativity starts coming from somewhere unknown, and you are amazed how you can create things without reading any book, without taking any help. And suddenly you become very, very creative.<br>
I have seen in Sahaja Yoga, how people have achieved great heights in creativity, in sports, in everything, because they get this energy, divine energy within them.<br>
So, they also understand, that they have to be more patient, more loving, more caring towards themselves and towards others also.<br>
......<br>
You do not borrow ideas from others, you don't learn by your own mad thinking, but you actually become creative under the influence of the Divine.<br>
And when the Divine starts working, is perfect, perfection. There's no competition. You create not out of competition, but just to create, freely. There's no compulsion.<br>
......<br>
And exposure of knees is very dangerous.<br>
......<br>
That is the main point you should have: is your concentration.<br>
And this concentration if it doesn't come, then you cannot work out anything.<br>
......<br>
To get angry is very wrong! To get angry is absolutely ruining yourself, is self-destructive.<br>
......<br>
Is a very, very great copacity [capacity] to be emotionally intelligent."<br>
