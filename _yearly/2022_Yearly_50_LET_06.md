"But the first and forth thing, fore ... foremost thing in the Vedas is that it should be Vida. Vida is the word, Vida is the main word. Now Vida means Bodha. Bodha means the experience of the central nervous system. It doesn't mean that I give you a big lecture or you read some books, you read Vedas by heart, no. It was meaning that you first become the Vidas, Vidvānās. Vid, Vid means the Bodha. That means the awareness must achieve its fourth dimension and should ... you should become a person with that fourth dimension, achieving the sensation of the All-pervading Power on your central nervous system. This was what Vedas were.<br>
But when you have achieved it, and then you read the Vedas, then you can have power on all the elements. So, then now, if you read Śhrutis and Smṛuti [sayings and tradition], it has a meaning.<br>
But to achieve that state, first of all, is important. That's why in Sahaja Yoga we don't deal with Vedas just now. We have to achieve that state when, by reading those Vedas or by saying those mantras, we can achieve that state in which automatically, spontaneously you can have power on all the elements. But not with desires, it just works out spontaneously. Is a state, is a state of a personality.<br>
......<br>
So it is necessary for Indian Sahaja Yogis to understand how we have failed. We must know our defects: `Why we have failed in our pursuit of God? Why there are so many temples?'<br>
......<br>
But we have to change the whole system upside down, otherwise things won't work out. The whole system has to be changed."<br>

<b>Objectives:</b><br>
1. To expedite the process of spiritual evolution by exciting the residual consciousness i.e. Kuṇḍalinī, to rise ultimately leading to Self-realization (Second Birth as defined in the Bible, the Koran, the Indian Scriptures and the great ancient Prophets and Sages all over the world).<br>
20. To counteract through mass spiritual power the destructive forces against spiritualism such as evil spirits, the cult of hypnotism, siddhis and the use of ``religion" for the exploitation of the innocent.
