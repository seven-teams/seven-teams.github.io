</p>

<p>
"Birthday of your Mother, and all such celebrations, have a very deep significance. Because on such occasions, special vibrations flow in the atmosphere. When all the celestial bodies, the Eternal Personalities, Gods and Goddesses, s-s-sing the praise, and that's how the whole atmosphere is filled with mirth and happiness.<br>
......<br>
Mediation is very important after Sahaja Yoga. You have slept and slept all your life: sleeping is not so important. You have to today promise Me that, from tomorrow, you all are going to get up in the morning and meditate.<br>
......<br>
[Do] you know that Sahaja Yoga is the only way? Is the only method that Divine Grace has given you, by which you are going to transform the whole world.<br>
And lazy lumps, how can they help Sahaja Yoga? Laziness is the worst thing.<br>
Today, I know today is not a day to say all these things, but you all have to promise to Me, that: `You are going to give up your laziness,' Swāhā. That's what I have seen that, whenever I meet you people, you are caught up.<br>
......<br>
So, one has to take a very, very pragmatic attitude towards-s Sahaj Yog, and Sahaja Yoga related to ourselves.<br>
......<br>
But first and foremost thing is: that you have to be absolutely all right. You have to learn Sahaja Yoga, you have to know, you have to be experts."<br>
