<font size="+2"><b>In Sahaja Yoga Everything Works Out</b><br></font>
</p>

<p>
"It was really uh very enjoyable today: to see all of you in such a happy mood. What happiness, what joy Sahaja Yoga has brought to all of you! Is really, I could never have imagined, that people could be that joyous and that relaxed, as you were this evening. <br>
......<br>
So see how the drama worked.<br>
And we were so amazed at [laughing:] the whole thing. When we came out Rajesh said: "Mother it was Mahā Sahaja Yoga!" [Laughter, applause.]<br>
So, in Sahaja Yoga everything works out. You must know that it all works out.<br>
But you must also know that you must have faith in Paramachaitanya. Also, [have] faith in yourself that you are in the Kingdom of God. <br>
......<br>
In the same way, we also forget that we have risen, and that we are completely transformed, and we are free, absolutely free people. Nothing can dominate us: none of our conditionings, none of our ego, nothing can dominate us, none of our habits. Everything has died out, and we are free birds to fly and to enjoy our flights. This is what we have to realize."<br>
