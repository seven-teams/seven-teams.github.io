"But is important for Sahaja Yoga that we have to live together. I also told the same thing in Perth, that try to get a big place. Because, you know, your children are there, and you all are there, and if you are together, negativity runs away. It has such a tremendous force, an Āśhram has a tremendous force. When you live together, you help each other, you understand each other, you know so many things, you learn so many things from each other. And it could be done very easily, once you start enjoying the collectivity.<br>
......<br>
And for our ascent is very important to be collective.<br>
......<br>
In Sahaja Yoga there's a Sahaj fashion. We don't change our dresses every day in Sahaja Yoga. See, every year we buy whatever is needed. That's all.<br>
......<br>
So that is what it is! That, when we understand the essence, now we a... we are on the essence when because we are on the Kuṇḍalinī, then we must know the essence of joy. And the joy is in sharing.<br>
......<br>
You are the hands of Virāṭa, and you can't give up like that.<br>
How can these hands say, `I'm separate'? `I'll work separately,' this hand will say, `I've separate work separately.' What work can be done like this? There has to be complete coordination, complete understanding.<br>
......<br>
So now, you change your attitudes.<br>
I think I've never spoken that clearly as I have spoken today, about these points. [Drinks tea.] Because you are at such a point where you can understand Me.<br>
We have to mature. Is such a responsibility!<br>
Tomorrow these children will be big, and they will take the responsibilities from you. But they should not say that, `What did our parents do ... about Sahaj Yog? Just created a mess for us!'<br>
So the whole attitude of Australia has to change: no quarreling, no fighting, no separate thing.<br>
......<br>
Only success in your ascent you should accept. And is such a nice thing to think of, `That beautiful think that you are, the glory you are, to be that.' And nothing else!"<br>
