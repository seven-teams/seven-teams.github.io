</p>

<p>
"So the world divided into so many country [countries], so many races, uuuh so many languages and also their own thinking. To think of a Global uh Religion was only possible when people got their Realization.<br>
......<br>
So you are not in charge of Sahaj Yog. It's like government servants: they are supposed to be servants but they are the bosses. They become bosses.<br>
So, the whole understanding should be of complete wisdom in Sahaj Yog."<br>
