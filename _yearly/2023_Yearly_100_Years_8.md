"Firstly, you must see for yourself what is Sahaja Yoga, what it has given you. It has given you Realization, it has given you that wider vision, it has given you Collective Consciousness, it has given you thoughtless awareness and doubtless awareness. It has made a new personality out of you, like an egg becoming a bird.<br>
......<br>
But the best part of it: that I don't need Sahaj Yog, and that Sahaja Yoga does not need you. You need Sahaja Yoga.<br>
In itself, Sahaja Yoga is complete. It does not need you. It is a complete thing, will remain like that, absolutely. It will have its own position, its own status, its own dignity, everything intact.<br>
But if you have to get something out of it, you have to work it out."<br>
