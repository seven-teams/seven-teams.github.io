"In our awareness, at least we should have feelings of compassion and love.<br>
But that one is lost. Is not there, we don't have it.<br>
The whole world is a flame, when you read about all the wars that are going, the way they are killing children, the way they are destroying human beings.<br>
It is a wrong attitude that with discretion of human beings, things will improve. It's a very, very wrong concept: that by destroying them, one can achieve something [unclear].<br>
Our work in Sahaja Yoga is doing well, I must say, but it has to stop this horrible attitude of human being to destroy.<br>
So you might ask then, 'What to do, Mother? What to do to destroy this destruction?' Answer is in the life of Christ: you resurrect people, you resurrect them, enlighten them, bring them to a state where they understand what is right and what is wrong. Let them feel, let them feel, the compassion and love that is within you. When that starts, that third force within us starts acting, our ego also comes down, our conditioning also comes down.<br>
For example, if we think, 'We are Muslims, we have a right to kill others,' if we think, uh, 'We are Jews, we have a right to kill other,' all these differentiations and this kind of discrimination that we have is so stupid, because: 'You are human beings, they are human beings. You are killing human beings!' Not that they have committed any sin or they have done anything wrong, except that, in their foolishness, they believe that they are this and they are that. You are not! You are just human beings.<br>
......<br>
You have got Kuṇḍalinī, everybody else has got Kuṇḍalinī. So you can only belong to the Religion of Humanity, where every human being has got Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
......<br>
For this, we have Christ. We have Christ, a person who was absolutely free: free from all kinds of prejudices, all kinds of temptations, all kinds of nonsense that human beings follow.<br>
But one may say that, 'Mother, after all, He was Divine!' He was Divine and now you are made divine also. <br>
So, how can we now join together to make a full effort, full effort to make, to tell people that, 'What are you doing? Why are you doing it? What is the need to do such things?' <br>
On one side is, we can say, a mass destruction through stupidity, another side is your own self-destruction. Take to drinking, take to-oo other self-destructive things which are immoral, that's very easily available, and people like it very much. And they don't like when you talk, that, 'This is destructive.' <br>
So, either we destroy others or destroy ourselves. Christ was destroyed by others, and He resurrected by Himself.<br>
So we are also in the same position now."<br>

<b>Objectives:</b><br>
9. To create a new generation of self-realized people and to render motherly protection to all such children against evil intentions and to look after their well-being.<br>
13. To employ the energy of love to overcome hatred that is the cause of wars, disintegration and destruction by publishing and relating the spiritual experiences of Sadhakas which prove the universal laws of love.
