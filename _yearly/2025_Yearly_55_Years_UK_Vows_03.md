"But how can one man fight the evils of this whole world? In the modern times when everything is moving very fast, it is very difficult for a single person to achieve anything without compromising with the trend of the world. Hence, it is absolutely essential that those artists who seek freedom and who believe that they have to play a vital role to further the cause of art, should give up their petty differences and jealousies and unite together. If such a group of artists decides to accept good in their personal, economic and social life and pledge not to deviate from the right path, then no power, however destructive, can lay hands on them. Unity of purpose can only grant them all the security needed for the creation of their Art."<br>

"So, all the activity on right-hand side of Saraswatī, basically has to end up in love: starts with love and ends up in love.<br>
......<br>
Light doesn't mean, Light doesn't mean what you see with your gross eyes. Light means from within: the Light of Love. That one should understand: Light of Love. And it's so soothing, is so sweet, it's so beautiful, it's so enamoring, it's so abounding that unless and until you can feel that Light within you -- that Light which is of pure love, of purity, pure relationships, pure understanding.<br>
......<br>
If Saraswatī will be in u ... is within us, She gives us subuddhi, wisdom.<br>
......<br>
And that's how a person who is a Sahaja Yogi should permeate, like music, into everything."<br>
