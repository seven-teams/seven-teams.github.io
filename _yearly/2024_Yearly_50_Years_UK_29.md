"Today is a very important day. Because, long time back, when Christ was just a child, He read from the Scriptures, and declared to the multitudes, that He was the Advent, the Incarnation, who is the Savior.<br>
They believed that a Savior is going to come.<br>
Today, long time back, on a Sunday, He said, He declared that He was the Savior. That's why today is the Advent Sunday. He had to live very sh... for a very, very short time, so at a very young age He ... He had to declare that He was the Advent.<br>
What it is remarkable to see, that before this, no Incarnation said publicly, that, They were Incarnations.<br>
......<br>
I never said about Myself. Because, it was felt: that human beings have now achieved another dimension of ego. Even worse than at the time of Christ.<br>
......"<br>
But today is the day I declare that I am the One who has to save the humanity. I declare I am the One who is Ādi Śhakti, who is the Mother of all the Mothers, who is the Primordial Mother, the Śhakti, the Desire of God, who has incarnated on this Earth to give Its meaning to Itself, to this creation, to human beings. And I'm sure, through My Love and Patience and My Powers, I am going to achieve it.<br>
I was the One who was born again and again, but now in My Complete Form and Complete Powers, I have come on this Earth, not only for salvation of human beings, not only for their emancipation, but for granting them, the Kingdom of Heaven, the Joy, the Bliss, that your Father wants to bestow upon you.<br>
[After 17 seconds:] These words are to be kept within the bounds of Sahaja Yogis only, for the time being.<br>
And today is the day of Guru Pūjā, not My Pūjā, but your Pūjā as gurus. I anoint all of you as gurus. And today I will tell you what I have bestowed upon you, and what great powers you already have within you."<br>
