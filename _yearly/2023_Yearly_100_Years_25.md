<p>
"The combination between left Viśhuddhi and joy is quite a lot.<br>
......<br>
Now you must know that He is the Primordial Being. He's the One who is the Whole. You have to become one with Him. He is the complete awareness, the Chitta, complete. Now we have to become one with Him.<br>
So first of all collectivity has to be developed.<br>
......<br>
If you have to grow in, grow in Sahaja Yoga, first thing is we must grow in collectivity.<br>
......<br>
So for Viśhuddhi, I would say that you should see the collectivity of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa."<br>
