</p>

<p>
"We keep searching something inside. There is no satisfaction within us. And we don't have any bearing power for anything. So we need to know, 'Why within us these dissatisfaction, pain, trouble, worries are there?' The reason is because of our mind and this mind is [an] institution made by us. We make this institution by two reactions."<br>
