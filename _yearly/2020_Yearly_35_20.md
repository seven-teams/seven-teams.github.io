<p>
"We have certain dharmas within us, and these dharmas are to be observed to get puṇyas.<br>
For a Sahaja Yogi, the first dharma is to be innocent and to be a holy person.<br>
......<br>
The second dharma is: to appreciate and understand the beauty of nature, to live with nature.<br>
......<br>
Now, regarding the Dharma of Nābhī is very important. The Dharma of Nābhī to begin with is, as you know, that you have to be a good householder. You have to be a gentleman in the sense you should be a gentle personality, should treat your family, your children, with gentleness.<br>
......<br>
So one thing about dharma is that it has its own limitations and its own grace and its own style. For example a man should behave like a man, not like a devil, of course, but also not like a henpecked husband. So there's some maryādās to all the dharmas. And out of that this is a very important dharma one has to follow.<br>
......<br>
Then comes the Dharma of Collectivity. In collectivity you should understand how to behave. You must understand how to carry on with the collectivity."<br>
