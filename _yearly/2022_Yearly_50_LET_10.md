"In politics, when we talk of communism, or of democracy or capitalism, we are talking of a concept but not of Reality.<br>
......<br>
So the meeting point only comes when all these ideologies become one at the lotus feet of your Spirit. Spirit is the only thing that is at the center.<br>
And in ... at the periphery if you look at things, they look as if they are separate and different. But if you can approach, somehow, into that state where your Spirit resides, you will be amazed to see that everything integrates, everything coordinates, and there is no difference, say, in Muhammad Sāhab, Dattātreya, Rāja Janaka, or Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth. There is no difference in Their Principle, if you can just get to your Spirit.<br>
But this is a very major step for human beings. It's a very major step for human beings. Because they want to live with concept and not with reality. This is one of the problems which we have faced throughout in Sahaja Yoga, all of us have faced it.<br>
......<br>
So the difference between the reality and the concept is this: that with concept we develop egos, or we develop a ... another system by which we feel obliged or anything, but with reality you just do it. It just works!<br>
......<br>
Concepts give you all misidentifications, with everything.<br>
So when it comes to reality, all these misidentishifications [misidentifications] just drop out. And that's why I have seen people transform so fast. I mean, you cannot believe it, how people transform.<br>
......
And this is the day today, we have to recognize that, as Sahaja Yogis, we stand no dangers in life. We are fearless people, but we are humble people, loving people, and anxious to save as many as possible. To eman... to raise the whole humanity into another awareness, in the process of your evolution you have to achieve ghat, for which you have to work hard. "<br>

<b>Objectives:</b><br>
4. To open the minds of people through meetings introducing ``thoughtless awareness" which discovers the subtle which at present is lost in gross words, books and dogmas. .<br>
21. To unite all genuine Seekers of Truth divided by dogmas and ignorance so that Satya Yuga (the Age of Truth) is born out of the present Kali Yuga (the Age of Darkness) rather than complete annihilation. To harness all the human resources to achieve this great task for which mass evolution will be needed.
