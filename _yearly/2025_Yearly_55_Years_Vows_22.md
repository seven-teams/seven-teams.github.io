<p>
"So today, you have to promise that you will never tell lies, whatever may be the consequences.<br>
......<br>
Today, make a decision that, `We will never be dishonest hereafter. And we will not remain in the company of dishonest people and if any one is dishonest we will expose him.'<br>
......<br>
I want the Sahaja Yogis to promise that neither will they lie nor will they support the people who lie.<br>
......<br>
Today all of you decide in your mind and take a resolution -- it is a very auspicious day today, very auspicious day -- that, `We won't do any dishonest deed nor will we believe in dishonesty.'<br>
......<br>
India's image is very much tarnished, hence take a vow today that, `From now onwards we shall not be dishonest and if there are any dishonest people we shall all get after him.'<br>
......<br>
So we should take a vow that we will not be dishonest and we would oppose the people who are dishonest."<br>
