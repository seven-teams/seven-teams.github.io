"Sahaja Yoga, as I have told you, is not for one person, it is not for one country, it is for the whole universe. That's why I said, now, we have established the Religion of Sahaja Yoga, is what we call the Universal Nirmala Religion [Vishwa Nirmala Dharma]. And this religion doesn't have any faith in the low level caste system, low level racial systems, low level political systems, and low level economic systems. It has its own understanding of the Divinity and it works with that."<br>
