"So one has to understand ... that: this is the time of Mahā Yoga, where all these Antar Yoga, means all these happening inside takes place [snaps Her fingers], automatically [snaps again].<br>
I have something to do with your Kuṇḍalinī, very much.! And She knows Me very well too. So much so [that] as soon as She sees Me She is up there. [Snaps again.] So happy! [Snaps again.]<br>
And the first impact is so great! You feel he's got it. [Snaps again.] She rises with such a thumping joy: `You get it!' [Snaps again.]<br>
......<br>
When this Mahā Yoga comes in, you do not have to worry about anything else! All the Yogas are at your feet. You just raise your hands just like this, and the Kuṇḍalinī will rise.<br>
It's a fact! You just try! Anybody is sick you just put your hand like this, and the person is going to be all right. Try yourself!<br>
This is Mahā Yoga: is the culmination point of Sahaja Yoga.<br>
Once you achieve it, then you don't have to do anything else! Then you become that. Because only everything works for the Becoming and if there's something that [snapping again:] just gives you the whole thing [snaps], then why should you do it."<br>
