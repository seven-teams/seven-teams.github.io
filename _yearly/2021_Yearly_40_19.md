"Under these circumstances, one has to understand that there are certain limitations which you have to observe.<br<
First of all, I have taken you in My body.<br>
......<br>
E ... it has to be [a] religious obligation that you must listen to Me, whatever I say. Actually you must obey Me! My hand obeys Me, My fingers obey Me, My Feet obey Me, what about you? Who are raised to the great dignity and the great position of being the Yogis in the body of the Ādi Śhakti, and they are acting as cells in My body.<br>
......<br>
This has to be regarded as the greatest thing, that Sahasrāra was opened by Me. Of course I am the master of Sahasrāra, I am the master of all the chakras, but also I'm beyond Sahasrāra, much beyond it. If that is the situation, you should be careful about your Sahasrāra, that is Me, and looking after your own heart, which is the Brahmarandhra Pīṭha [touching it on top of Her head:] here, which opens out ultimately when you get your Realization. <br>
......<br>
To keep the Sahasrāra clean is to open your heart. If your hearts are not open, how will I fill it up with My Love? Open your heart to your fellow Yogis and Yoginīs.<br>
......<br>
In Sahaja Yoga also when we enter, be careful: materialism should not enter into your minds. Is nothing important.<br>
......<br>
In Sahaja Yoga also people must learn to lead a life of collectivity. Is very important that we have to be collective."<br>
