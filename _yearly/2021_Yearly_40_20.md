</p>

<p>
"The Spirit is paramount: It is the highest thing. Nothing can reach It. It keeps you away from all this skirmishes, all the cheap and superficial problems of the world.<br>
Materialism has grown much more today than ever before. It has become very important for people to worry about things that they possess. I find in the West, it has grown so subtly and so sophisticatedly that it is difficult even to find out how far we have gone with it. Is like plastic, which can penetrate into everything and can hold it.<br>
......<br>
We have to be normal people, as Sahaja Yogis, to understand, that: 'We'll not allow matter to supersede us.'<br>
Now, today, just to celebrate the Sahasrāra Day in full way, I thought of wearing a sāṛī with many chakras. It has some symbol. Is [a] symbolic thing. And the starry sky, that you see all over, to represent that, the blue color. Blue color is the sign of depth. It has some symbol.<br> 
Is not without any symbol, without any meaning, that you wear anything because some factory is producing these things in bulk, and they must be sold. We should be out of all these things. These things should not touch us, these sh... things should not impress us, but we should laugh at them, `Oh, then's, now, the new craze has started, another one.'<br>
......<br>
Imagine, you have seen, so many of you have seen now Ajanta [Caves]. This was built in ten centuries, cut from top to bottom. How they must have planned it, how they must have organized among themselves in ten generations, how they must have painted it! And there's nothing! No city, nothing, no television, no food, how they lived there? They lived on dedication and love of Buddha, whom they had never seen! Such personalities they were, such involvement. Once they took up something, they were absolutely dedicated with [to] it.<br>
......<br>
So, this-s idea of materialism has grown like a ghost now, into the minds of people: that matter is more important. That, 'Materially if you are all right, you are all right.' "<br>
