"It is such a pleasure for Me to be your Mother, and to be able to communicate the Divine, the Powers of Divine, the Beauty of Divine, to you. It was never possible before, as you know. Everyone tried their level best, but nobody could achieve it, to communicate that beauty.<br>
As you know, Sahaja Yoga, or this Mahā Yoga, is a very unique system: it never existed before. It has come into existence, of course, I should say that because the Parabrahma decided to take a form, but you also all decided to come on this Earth to receive the blessings. It cannot be possible to do anything with one hand.<br>
The beauty of Sahaja Yoga is great, no doubt, which I'm sure, very soon people will realize. That this is the only way. All lost people will come back to Sahaj Yog, I'm sure, and they will achieve what they are due.<br>
You don't have to do anything about Sahaja Yoga, you just walk in, and you can get Realization.<br>
......<br>
It's a great thing that such a day has come that people are feeling it round the world that, 'It is a great day when the Divine decided to start this Mahā Yoga.' "<br>
