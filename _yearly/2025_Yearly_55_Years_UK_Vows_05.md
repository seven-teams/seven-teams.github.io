<font size="+2"><b>Today We Have To Decide Once For All.</b><br></font>
</p>

<p>
"Forget whatever has happened, whatever wrong you must have done in Sahaja Yoga. From today decide that, 'We will behave in the same way which suits to Sahaja Yoga as we are Sahaja Yogis,' we should say this in the beginning, in the middle and at the end, say it three times that, 'We are Sahaja Yogis, we will not do this, we won't do this as this is wrong.' We should start today's day with this resolution.<br>
......<br>
So there is only one importance of today's Pūjā, 'Correct your Gaṇapati and start the work with determination, and dedicate ourselves to Sahaja Yoga, with pure and clean heart surrender to Sahaja Yoga, and be good Sahaja Yogis,' we should take this pledge today.<br>
......<br>
Now the third thing is that with all these things we are doing, we must promise to God also that, 'We will know about Sahaja Yoga through proper understanding, reading every word of it, we'll master the knowledge of Sahaj Yog, we'll keep ourselves clean, and completely surrender our lives to Sahaja Yoga.' This is what you have to promise in your heart. Surrendering to Sahaja Yoga is actually surrendering to joy, bliss and peace. In that you are the gainer, nobody is a loser in it. This is how today we have to decide once for all.<br>
......<br>
Have all the strength, have all the courage, and go ahead with this promise onward, because I think now Sahaja Yoga is going to take a new turn. Definitely it is going to take. We are going to come up to a stage where thousands and thousands will join Sahaj Yog."<br>
