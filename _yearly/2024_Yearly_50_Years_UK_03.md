"We have to understand that people are not normal in these modern times. There's something going wrong with them somewhere. It may be something serious is happening within us, which is giving such a collective effect outside.<br>
Now the trouble is: we do not know what we are inside. Unless and until we know what we are, unless and until there is light within us, we cannot understand what's the problem with us is.<br>
......<br>
Today the war is within, within ourselves, not without. We are not realizing how it is building up within ourselves.<br>
......<br>
On the whole, England is the heart of the whole universe. From here, everything circulates.<br>
You have no idea of this country. You have no esteem of this country. The way we have tortured our Motherland here, I wish people could know! She is suffering within Herself.<br>
Only Blake has cried. He has cried of Jerusalem, and that's what I'm talking about. He could see that vision because He was that sensitive. He's the one who was a realized Soul. And He was that sensitive, He could feel it. And the way He has described, the way He has talked, the glory of this country.<br>
All this inertia, all this lethargy, all these curses that are settling into this country are because of our foolishness and stupidity.<br>
You are the most dynamic people. And not only that, in spirituality you are very dynamic. For your spiritual work, you can be very, very dynamic. You are the ones who are going to throw away all the shackles of nonsense and you are the one who are groing [going] to recreate a beautiful arena of for the whole world."<br>
