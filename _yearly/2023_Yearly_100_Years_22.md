"Today is a very great day for all the Sahaja Yogi[s]. Because Sahasrāra opened in you, you could feel the existence of God. ...... This's a very big opening all over the world. Today I say that's why is one of the greatest day for you.<br>
......<br>
But now I have to say that quite a lot of you can become gurus, means teachers, and you should act as teachers.<br>
To act as teacher you should know Sahaja Yoga, the theory and the practice of it, thoroughly well and then you can become a guru. It's a very responsibility, lot of understanding for a guru.<br>
......<br> 
So you have to be a perfect Sahaja Yogi, thenly [then only] you can be a guru. And so many of you can be, but you have to ascertain first: `Are you capable of being your guru or not?'<br>
......<br>
You have to do now My work. I won't be able to go all over, but you have to go to other countries and create new Sahaja Yogis. You can do it.<br>
......<br>
So, I'm telling you that you have to take over and work it out. That doesn't mean you cancel Me [some laughter], no, not at all. I am there with you and every place you work you put My Photograph, but Realization you have to give and try to give mass Realization. If that doesn't work out, then you should know you are not a guru. If you can give mass Realization, then only you are a guru. Otherwise you are not. I said you can use My Photograph but you have to give Realization to people. This is the sign of a guru.<br>
......<br>
This is a big power you have got, you all should use. First of all you can use a group if you want, and afterwards you should do it individually. Can you imagine all of you, if you become gurus, how many Sahaja Yogis we'll have all over the world‽<br>
......<br>
This is you[r] responsibility. This is how Sahaja Yoga will grow. Otherwise, after I'll retire or I'll don't go anywhere, then Sahaja Yoga will go into waste. So it is for you to carry the torch, the light. It's your responsibility now. You have got your Realization.<br>
......<br>
This is the day of Guru Pūrṇimā and I bless you that you all become gurus.<br>
......<br>
 It is not My old age but I want to give you a complete freedom to spread Sahaja Yoga. You have got with free and you also have to give it to people free -- not to charge there.<br>
......<br>
You have to save the world. All My work is that."<br>
