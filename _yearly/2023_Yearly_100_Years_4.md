"I have to tell ... I'll have to tell you the story about the Sahasrāra Day, about which it was decided, long time back, before I incarnated. They had a big meeting in the Heavens, all the thirty-five karoṛs [350 millions] of Gods, the Deities, were there present to decide what is to be done. 'This is the ultimate that we have to do to human beings: is to open their Sahasrāra, to open their awareness to the Spirit, to the Real Knowledge of the Divine, to remove the darkness of ignorance.' And it had to be spontaneously because it has to work the living force of God. Also it had to be very quick. So all the Gods requested that now, I, the Ādi Śhakti, has to take the birth.<br>
......<br>
It had to be before the sixth of May, because sixth of May was the Doomsday in that year. So it was done on the fifth of May at the nick of the time. It was all decided beforehand. And every Deity's job was allotted to all of Them, very efficient Deities, very obedient. They knew Me very well, completely dedicated and devoted, they knew Me eve... very, very well, every end of My hair they knew. I didn't have to teach Them protocol.<br>
Love itself gives you protocol.<br>
......<br>
What a tremendous task it was!<br>
So, I said, at Sahasrāra I had to be Mahāmāyā. I had to be Mahāmāyā. I had to be something that people cannot recognize Me easily. But Deities? No. This Māyā ... Mahāmāyā had to come on this Earth, not the Ādi Śhakti in Her purest form, is too much. So, She was covered with this Mahāmāyā.<br> 
......<br>
And is already predicted that the whole world will come down at the Lotus Feet of your Mother and that you will decide the future of this world. Is written, already, fourteen thousand years back, and there's another one who is prophesizing the same."<br>
