"It was such a pleasure, such a hap... joy for Me to see that you gave Realization to so many people and you managed to convince them about Sahaj Yog.<br>
......<br>
For you it is a difficult task to talk about Sahaja Yoga. But I would say you should go all out: not to feel shy, not to make reservations about it.<br>
......<br>
We have to talk. That's the only way we can spread Sahaja Yoga.<br>
......<br>
If you have to become a Sahaja Yogi, then it has to be worked out. And that takes time: to rise from Nirvichāra to Nirvikalpa it takes time.<br>
......<br>
So, for Sahaja Yogis it is important, first of all, to watch themselves.<br>
......<br>
So, it is important to understand: the first rule of Sahaja Yoga is that you look at yourself. 'How are you? Are you really progressing? Or you are worried about other thing like your business, this, that? Or you are worried about your ascent? What are you worried about? Are you worried about your ascent? If you are worried about your ascent, what are you doing about it?' That has to be the main object of life. The rest of the things follow it. Once you ascend, the whole cosmos can look after your problems. But you must ascend into the Kingdom of God, that's the main point is."<br>
