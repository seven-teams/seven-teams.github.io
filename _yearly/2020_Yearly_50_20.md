"Specially in the land of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa we have to work out this tremendous task of creating Virāṭas out of Sahaj Yogis.<br>
After going through the various experiences of American Sahaja Yoga, I've reached the conclusion that we have to talk more frankly about things than we have been talking before: why there's such a failure of Sahaja Yoga in this great country while there are so many seekers.<br>
......<br>
So now, the problem lies with Sahaja Yogis, not with Sahaja Yoga as such. When you see that the land is not so fertile and here you have to work very hard, the responsibility of all the Sahaja Yogis in America is to go deep.<br>
......<br>
In the same way the Sahaja Yogis of America have to work out because here it's so much superficiality and so much of frivolousness and also no meaning to their lives. They have no meanings at all and they are just frittering away their lives with all nonsensical ideas about their emotions and their love and all those things.<br>
......<br>
So the first thing a Sahaja Yogi has to do: has to make up something of his personality. In America is very important. Uh they are studying, they are out of job, they are doing this, that bad's. That sort of people are not going to help Sahaja Yoga at all: they'll be liabilities on Sahaja Yoga.<br>
......<br>
The leaders are fighting, the leaders are trying to find out ways and methods: `How to improve the quality of Sahaja Yogis.' But is the Sahaja Yogis who have to know that the responsibility is theirs. They have to grow, they have to become Virāṭas.<br>
......<br>
Sahaja Yoga is not going to work by advertisement, nor by My Photographs. Is going to work by your work, by your responsibility, by your shouldering Sahaja Yoga. It's your responsibility to spread Sahaja Yoga and to establish it. But first of all your shoulders should be strong. You are still out of job, you are still something, somebody hanging in the air, you are still somebody who will not even look at you, then how can you carry on your shoulders?<br>
......<br>
So on one side: the dynamism is to be used for yourself, and the dynamism is to be used for Sahaja Yoga.<br>
......<br>
Same thing is Sahaja Yoga. If you put mathematically, Sahaja Yoga can never be established in America if you add up more and more of this kind of people.<br>
......<br>
Life for us is nothing but Sahaja Yoga, and Sahaja Yoga is nothing but enlightening ourselves and others."<br>
