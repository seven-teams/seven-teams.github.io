"Today, we have come here to worship Jesus Christ and His Mother. 

In [is] such a coincidence that the Mother of Christ came and stayed in Turkey. Isn't it surprising that She should come here after the crucifixion of Christ and stayed here. I wonder if He comes ... He kī also came with Her later on, but they say then He went to Kashmir and She was also there. Quite possible on their way, they might have gone there. 

So, we are here to worship Him. [Silence for 9 seconds.]

According to Sahaja Yoga, She was the Incarnation of Mahālakṣhmī. And She's the One who sacrificed Her Son for the sake of religion. But, unfortunately, nobody understood Her value. Nobody saw that She was such a great spiritual personality. Only through Sahaja Yoga you can understand that She was a very great personality who gave birth to Christ."<br>
