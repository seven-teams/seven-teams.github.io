"And the here they have tried to establish how astrology is so correct. And whatever is predicted fourteen thousand [14,000] years back is also today coming up.<br>
But uh, this is about two thousand [2,000] years back, one of the great astrologers of this place, not Sholapur, but little downward, Karnataka, he described about this thing so clear-cut that, I mean, you will be amazed, that he said that: "This uh ... Great Yogi will come on this Earth on the Mīna Rāśhi," the Pisces.<br>
So, I'm just on the cusp of the Pisces and the Aries, you see. But that's not so important.<br>
Then he said s-sho... says that, "Gradually we'll start seeing some miracles in ninety ... from nineteen sixty-four [1964] to sixty-six [1966] [a Sahaja Yogi is amazed], which he says that, maybe little bit. But he says, "The ... the real change, Manvantar [period or age of a Manu], in the age, the New Age, He will start from nineteen seventy [1970]."<br>
......<br>
... the New Age will be formed, and this, the old one, Vaivas... Vaivastav -- you see, there's one, another -- we have yugas, you see, one of the yugas -- will be over, and that yuga is in Kali Yuga. So that's how Kali Yuga will be finished, from nineteen seventy [1970].<br> 
......<br>
New Age of Active Divinity, Kṛuta Yuga will start. Al right.<br>
[After a comment of a Sahaja Yogi:] That time, that time, the Sun will rule in a new way, the Sun. The axis of Earth will be reduced and the speed of the Earth will be reduced, gradually.<br>
And that time a Great Mahā-yogi will be born who will be completely Parabrahma, completely Parabrahma.<br>
That's Me."<br>
