</p>

<p>
"But He was a model: model of a Saint, model of a realized Soul, model of a person who came all the way from the Heavens to save us. "<br>
......
As it is, Jesus was Incarnation of Śhrī Gaṇeśha. It's a very difficult task He has performed. He used to convince people who were absolutely ignorant about spirituality, who just knew about money and nothing else. He came in those days when people had no idea about spirituality at all, at all.<br>
......
This is one thing to be understood from the life of Christ: He was a very simple, poor man, son of a carpenter. And to Him, money was nothing but a[n] absolutely useless thing. To Him, Spirit was everything. And He was preaching and telling people that, ``You must have spiritual awakening. Very important. Try to understand that there is life beyond all this and then you should get the best uh results out of this life, which you are just wasting."<br>
He was so intelligent and the way they He discussed with all those great fathers from the church about the religion and all that, it's amazing how a little boy could understand so deeply about religion. He was a small boy [at] that time, no doubt, but He was a person from the Divine, created by the Divine: He was Śhrī Gaṇeśha, He is Auṃ, He is knowledge, everything."
