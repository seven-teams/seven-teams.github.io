"Only Blake has cried. He has cried of Jerusalem, and that's what I'm talking about. He could see that vision because He was that sensitive. He's the one who was a realized Soul. And He was that sensitive, He could feel it. And the way He has described, the way He has talked, the glory of this country."<br>

"There's one more thing: I was happy to learn that the great poet of this country, Blake, had prophesied about Me.<br>
And it is so beautifully done, that He said that: "England is going to be the Jerusalem." We, this is going to be the pilgrimage. The venue has shifted.<br>
And then He has very beautifully -- have you got the thing to read? No. You haven't brought [it].<br>
But what reading! That: He has said that first thing furnace will be burning in Surrey Hills, where I came first, and then He has mentioned Lambeth Vale, where we have got our Āśhram. Where the foundations will be laid, we have laid the foundations.<br>
And that Jerusalem is going to be in England, not in India. And you are the people responsible for this Jerusalem. "<br>

"I would say Blake, William Blake, you read Him! You will be amazed! He is talking of today in His book `Milton'. He is talking of Jerusalem of today, this place, this England is going to be the Jerusalem, is the pilgrimage, where the people of God are going to be the Prophets. He has talked of today, can you imagine‽ He was not very old, He was not very ancient: very modern. He has prophesized about these days and it is happening."<br>
