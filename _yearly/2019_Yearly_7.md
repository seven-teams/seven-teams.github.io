"We have had a big conference of the scientist[s], there were two thousand scientist[s] and about ten thousand people, and they were convinced that morality is very important for medicine. Without morality people cannot keep good health, they contaminate diseases.<br> 

And I was surprised. This is only possible in your country, either Russia or Kiev, where people have such enlightened mind. No one can think of such a thing in other countries. You people are very advanced in your wisdom. Also, you are very deep in understanding spirituality, how important it is."<br>
