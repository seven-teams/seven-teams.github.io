<font size="+2"><b>Tremendous Task Of Creating Virāṭas Out Of Sahaja Yogis and Life For Us Is Nothing But Sahaja Yoga</b><br></font>
</p>

<p>
"And today what one feels that in America there's more dominance of the left side than of the right. Right side is our attention and the right side of attention is, we can say, is the liver of God Almighty.<br>
So now when we have to talk of the totality, when we are part and parcel of the totality, and now we are awakened to that existence of ours as the part and parcel of the whole, then we have to realize: to become the whole we have to do something about it. Specially in the land of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, we have to work out this tremendous task of creating Virāṭas out of Sahaja Yogis.<br>
After going through the various experiences of American Sahaja Yoga, I've reached the conclusion that we have to talk more frankly about things than we have been talking before: why there's such a failure of Sahaja Yoga in this great country while there are so many seekers.<br>
......<br>
In the same way the Sahaja Yogis of America have to work out because here it's so much superficiality and so much of frivolousness and also no meaning to their lives. They have no meanings at all and they are just frittering away their lives with all nonsensical ideas about their emotions and their love and all those things.<br>
......<br>
That all these souls which have died, I think, have possessed them, and now, today, America is on the left-hand side. The right-hand side of Americans is finished now. They are on the left-hand side: guilty, feeling guilty, they are taking to indulgences.<br>
......<br>
So, to become one part and parcel of the whole, a drop has to become the ocean, you have to become great people, you have to be responsible.<br>
And this lovey-dovey business that you have has to go out of your mind completely, otherwise Sahaja Yoga cannot work out in these two countries. And you'll be cursed one after another.<br>
There are shocks after shocks that are coming to this country as well as to England. But people are not learning any lessons from them. Still it is, 'All right, we get this disease, uh all right, then we glorify it. If ee [we] uh-uh-uh uh are suffering from ecological difference, still we are glorified.' If you are using too much of machinery out of balance, still, 'We are glorified.' Because they just want self-indulgence. Just for self-indulgence they don't want to see the point that what is going wrong with this country is that: that they do not see anything that is reality.<br>
......<br>
So the first thing a Sahaja Yogi has to do: has to make up something of his personality.<br>
......<br>
To become Virāṭa we have to really examine ourselves without any anger, malice or anything, but see for ourselves.<br>
......<br>
So you have to watch within yourself: that we are here for liberation, for complete freedom.<br>
......<br>
So first thing is to build yourself inside as well as outside.<br>
......<br>
But one has to think that: 'We have to change our lifestyle. We have to change our attitudes.'<br>
......<br>
Now, if you have to take to the Sahaj Culture, you have to know that we have to have a discipline in our life. We have to have education, we have to have a place, we have to have a position in the society. Because we are not sitting in the Himalayas, somewhere lost in the Himalayas sitting there and just uh-uh-uh-uh doing our tapasyā.<br>
......<br>
So transformation, of course, means evolution. It also means that whatever basis you had, you have to evolve out of it.<br>
......<br>
And I wish for you that you understand what I am saying today. And I request you, all of you, to be alert and dynamic and work it out. Each single person has to come up.<br>
......<br>
So on one side: the dynamism is to be used for yourself, and the dynamism is to be used for Sahaja Yoga.<br>
......<br>
Same thing is Sahaja Yoga. If you put mathematically, Sahaja Yoga can never be established in America if you add up more and more of this kind of people.<br>
......<br>
So when we believe that we are Sahaja Yogis, we have to know that in a subtle way we are still caught up into the webs of our own understanding about life.<br>
So that we have to change. Life for us is nothing but Sahaja Yoga, and Sahaja Yoga is nothing but enlightening ourselves and others."<br>
