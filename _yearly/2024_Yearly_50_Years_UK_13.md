<font size="+2"><b>Motherhood Is The Highest Thing</b><br></font>
</p>

<p>
"The most essential thing is: that our children should feel our presence, which will soothe him down, and make him a personality full of peace. <br>
......<br>
So, today is a day of our understanding, and a promise, to Me, that you will try to be good mothers. <br>
......<br>
Motherhood is the highest thing.<br>
......<br>
But apart from that, the idea of the education is that: that to instill in them, first of all, the sense of self-respect, to begin with. That we'll have to teach them what is self-respect and how to understand the importance of self-respect. And then they will be taught on those lines various things, like: `We must learn to keep our things properly, to keep the place clean and to respect it.' To respect your school, to respect your teachers, to respect all that is there."<br>
