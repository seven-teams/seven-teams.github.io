<b>Sahaj Yogi:</b> "Why are You to be known as Mātājī?"<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> As Śhrī Mātājī?<br>
<b>Sahaj Yogi:</b> Mhh!<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> That's the title they gave Me! What can I do? In India. [Applause.]<br>
You have to be an Indian to understand that.<br>
<b>Sahaj Yogi:</b> I think he will understand.<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> There are certain things described, about Śhrī Mātājī.<br>
If you have read any books, of Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, or of Mārkaṇḍeya Himself, then you will know.<br>
And the qualities described there, of such a person, if they find it in someone, they call that person by that name. Isn't it?<br>
Like M... Gāndhījī was called as Mahātmā Gāndhī. Mahātmā means a 'Bigger Spirit' than others. Because he had that! He didn't care for himself, for his own family, for him's ... uh everything for his own, but he thought of the whole country. That's why he was called Mahātmā!<br>

"See, look at Mahātmā Gāndhī, how he looked like. I don't know. I have seen him, I've lived with him in My childhood. Such a bony structure, but even uh Samson would have been afraid of him, he was like that! [Some laughtert.] Such a Power of Truth and Honesty in his heart. Is not that his face was very impressive, but the inner power which was within him.<br>
I know of another Prime Minister very well, Lal Bahadur Shastri. I'm talking about him because both were born on the same date of second of October. Another person, tremendously powerful, very short man! So powerful he was! And his Realization of such a high degree! He could easily make out who is who.<br> 
Of course, he respected Me very much. I used to be very shy, because he would not even sit before Me on the chair. Is what we call Self-realization."<br>

<b>Objectives:</b><br>
5. To introduce the only one internal living religion lying dead and camouflaged under external practices and precepts of religion in all the human beings and for this to organize tours and hold spiritual meetings as per wishes of Mātājī.<br>
To open, organize and run local centers of the Life Eternal Institution in various parts of India and in foreign countries, the centers being opened on the distinct understanding that meditation is the path of the entire human destiny, and that all barriers of states, nations and races are artificial and irrelevant to Life Eternal.<br>
