"We have Hazarat ʿAlī, who was Himself, according to our Sahaja Yoga, He was an Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhab was. We worship Muhammad Sāheb, Hazarat ʿAlī, and Fāṭimah. For us, they are much more than you know in Qur'ān, which, later on you'll find out: how they are related to India. They are very, very great Souls who came on this Earth, and because these fanatics didn't understand Them, They killed them.<br>
......<br>
[Receives a card with a question.] Now, he's asked Me a very nice question: [Reading:] "What is Your religion now?" To be very frank, My religion is a Universal Religion. This is the religion that Gāndhījī, Mahātmā Gāndhī preached. That we don't only respect, but we worship. We worship Muhammad Sāhab, Hazarat ʿAlī, Fāṭimah Bi, all of Them. Worship! Also, we worship Christ, we worship Moses. Also, we worship Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa and Śhrī Rām. Because They are all flowers of the same Tree of Spirituality. At different times They came."<br>

"Hazarat ʿAlī is the One who is the Incarnation of a Creator, who created the whole universe.<br>
N... now this truth can be proved! This truth can be proved! How? If you are a self-realized person, and your hands are speaking, then if you ask a question, 'Was ʿAlī, Hazarat ʿAlī, was the One who created all this universe?', you start getting tremendous Cool Breeze.<br> 
......<br>
But now you will know why Muhammad Sāhab and Hazarat ʿAlī came. For what purpose? To let you know what you are."<br>
