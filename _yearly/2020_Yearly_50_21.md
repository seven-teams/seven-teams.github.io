<p>
"And when we look at life, we do not understand that if we miss this chance of our evolution, not only that we'll miss it for ourselves, not only that we'll miss it for England, or only for one country, but we'll miss it for the whole creation.<br>
......<br>
So, if so, how much important it is that you should have the desire to be one with the Divine, to be in Yoga, to be one with your Spirit.<br>
......<br>
The identification with the ego is so much, that's easy to take a bull by the horn but to take a[n] ego-oriented man through Sahaja Yoga's practices is very difficult.<br>
......<br>
Sahaja Yogis also sometimes feel very frustrated, I know. But whatever it is, as far as I am concerned, I've tremendous desire now. But I am so desireless that this desire also may not work out. You see, I am a desireless person. Now what to do? So I ask Sahaja Yogis to desire, that the people should have that great desire to become the Spirit.<br>
This is the greatest thing that we can give to our brothers and sisters, to the progeny, to the people who are children today, to this beautiful world. We need these beautiful lights and the beautiful time which they all have to enjoy."<br>
