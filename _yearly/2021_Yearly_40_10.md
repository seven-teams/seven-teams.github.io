"First point: there is no fundamentalism in Sahaja Yoga. Nobody should use My words or say, 'Mother said so,' nobody should. That is how all this hierarchies have been built: in the churches, everywhere. Everybody can read, every[body] can do it, you can find out. There is no way of controlling people by saying: 'Mother said so.' That shows that you are trying to use My words to tell people off. You are not in charge.<br>
......<br>
So it's a journey: journey of Sahaja Yoga to our destination. The destination is that we have to emancipate maximum number of human beings into Sahaja Yoga.<br>
......<br>
So, first of all we must know it's a living process. You cannot put on it artificial types of things, aah which will curb the growth of Sahaja Yoga. Is very important to understand. There where I find that people don't understand Sahaj Yog. You cannot mold into any pattern. It molds by itself. Works by itself.
......<br>
But you are the heart of the family. Brain can die, but heart dies the last. So try to understand: there should be a complete integration between heart and brain. And children are the attention, in the society of Sahaja Yoga.<br>
......<br>
Simple things, I'll tell you what. They asked Me, "Mother, what do You think of starting a Vishwa Nirmala Dharma in Melbourne?" I said, "All right." I didn't know that is going to be an association, there is going to be an election and all, nothing. Just I said, "All right." Just to start is all right.<br>
Vishwa Nirmala Dharma is everywhere, but they don't have any association, nothing. It's uh just a kind of a society, which is just spreading Vishwa Nirmala Dharma. There is, no uh sort of uh-uh any organization about it. We only have Trus[ts], and we don't want to have any election[eer]ing or all that.<br>
......<br>
This has to be understood very well: that Sahaja Yoga is not liable for you. You are liable for Sahaja Yoga."<br>
