<p>
"First point: there is no fundamentalism in Sahaja Yoga. Nobody should use My words or say, 'Mother said so,' nobody should. That is how all this hierarchies have been built, in the churches everywhere. Everybody can read, every can do it you can find out. There is no way of controlling people by saying: 'Mother said so.' That shows that you are trying to use My words to tell people off. You are not in charge.<br>
......<br>
So it's a journey: journey of Sahaja Yoga to our destination. The destination is that we have to emancipate maximum number of human beings into Sahaja Yoga.<br>
......<br>
So, first of all we must know it's a living process. You cannot put on it artificial types of things, aah which will curb the growth of Sahaja Yoga. Is very important to understand. There where I find that people don't understand Sahaj Yog. You cannot mold into any pattern. It molds by itself. Works by itself.
......<br>
But you are the heart of the family. Brain can die, but heart dies the last. So try to understand: there should be a complete integration between heart and brain. And children are the attention, in the society of Sahaja Yoga.<br>
......<br>
Simple things, I'll tell you what. They asked Me, "Mother, what do You think of starting a Vishwa Nirmala Dharma in Melbourne?" I said, "All right." I didn't know that is going to be an association, there is going to be an election and all, nothing. Just I said, "All right." Just to start is all right.<br>
Vishwa Nirmala Dharma is everywhere, but they don't have any association, nothing. It's uh just a kind of a society, which is just spreading Vishwa Nirmala Dharma. There is, no uh sort of uh-uh any organization about it. We only have Trus[ts], and we don't want to have any election[eer]ing or all that.<br>
......<br>
This has to be understood very well: that Sahaja Yoga is not liable for you. You are liable for Sahaja Yoga."<br>
