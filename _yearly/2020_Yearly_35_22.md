"Still, we have to hope that this kind of religion will finish. All such religions must finish. They have to go now, is too much! You cannot support them! They are so much full of anti-religious temperament that you just can't bear them. Is better to finish Islam, Hinduism, Christianity, Sikhism, Buddhism, Jainism, all isms one after another. [Some laughter.]<br>
To what religion did Christ belong? I don't know.<br>
You are belong to One Religion which is Sahaj, which is the Universal Religion, which is the Pure Religion, which is born within you. You don't belong to any other religion because there is no religion in that.<br>
So, by the time 2000 years, I hope, all these religions will run away from this Earth. [Applause.]<br>
All of them fighting for nothing at all, killing each other for nothing at all. They want, they want to fight, they like to fight. Why blame Qur'ān, why blame Bible, why blame Christ, dhy ... why blame anyone? They want to fight: they are of divisive nature. They want to have separate nations, separate community, separate this. Once you start of separating you are anti-Christ, absolutely."<br>
