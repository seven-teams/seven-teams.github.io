<b>Sahaja Yogi</b>: She is the One who is respected by the Saints as the Mother, as the Mātājī, who has come on this Earth to give the blessings of God to the seekers, and to give the Creation its own meaning.<br>
So, without any further introduction from me, it gives me great pleasure, ladies and gentlemen, to introduce to you again: Her Holiness Śhrī Mātājī Nirmalā Devī.<br>
......<br>
<font color="red"><b>Śhrī Mātājī</b></font>: ...... Or, there is no other measure by which you are going to be judged, but by knowing how far truthful you are about your seeking and how far you can gain something about it. 
......<br>
 It would be very civil of you to be away from us because we are not identified with any organization but with our own Self. 

We have no organization, you know, in Sahaja Yoga. And every ps ... type of a person is allowed to come in Sahaja Yoga, so that he gets the full advantage of his destiny.<br>
......<br>
The three people who went to see Jesus when He was born were Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, Maheśha. Is described, were the three great people who went to see Jesus He was born was Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa as Viṣhṇu, and Maheśha is Śhiva, and Brahmā as Brahmadeva. All these people went to worship Her. Nobody knew from where they came, who they were: they were called as the three wise men.</font><br>

<p>
<b>Objectives:</b>
To spread the news of the descent of the Divine Grace, with the help of self-realized disciples of Mātājī.<br>
To unite all genuine Seekers of Truth divided by dogmas and ignorance so that Satya Yuga (the Age of Truth) is born out of the present Kali Yuga (the Age of Darkness) rather than complete annihilation. To harness all the human resources to achieve this great task for which mass evolution will be needed.
