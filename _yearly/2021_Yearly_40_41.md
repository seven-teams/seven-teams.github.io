"...... you must realize your own personal responsibility. That you all have got Sahaja Yoga absolutely free, but uh you have a certain debt. And that debt is that you have to give Realizations to others. If you just have it for yourself, and leave only to your leaders to work it out, it will never work out.<br>
......<br>
Now the reason is, also, I personally think, that you not only feel shy, but you are quite satisfied with yourself and you have no confidence about others. You think, 'What will they think?' Why what will they think after all? What will they do to you? What will happen to them? I mean, if you tell them they are not going to prosecute you, take you to courts.<br>
......<br>"<br>
So, you have to take to Sahaja Yoga in a proper way: in your family, in ... with your children, with everything. <br>
......<br>
Now, you have become Sahaja Yogis, you are masters now! Why should any problems uh make you suffer? Why should you? You are contented within yourself! All these problems, useless absolutely, should not bother you. That means you are not yet come up to that level which we can call a master. I call you masters! You are like Zen Masters!<br>
......<br>
I have seen many Sahaja Yogis who came to Me and they said, "And we don't want to do graduation, Mother, we don't want to study. Uh-uh-uh we want to become uh garbage cleaners." I said, "Why‽" [A Sahaja Yoginī laughs.] "Because you can get lot of money in garbage cleaning."<br>
Can you believe that‽<br>
So the whole attitude is towards getting money at any cost: no dignity, no understanding, nothing. <br>
Can you believe that? So the whole attitude is towards getting money at any cost -- no dignity, no understanding, nothing.<br>
......<br>
First and foremost for children is discipline and their education. You must pay all money, whatever is needed, all your attention, to educate your children.<br>
......<br>
So, our behavior should be such: should be very humble, sharing, caring, so that people are impressed by it.<br>
......<br>
The whole world we can save. We have to save the whole world! My vision is too big! And you are My children, you are My hands. I cannot ask anybody else to do it. And that's why I have to tell you that: you just be worried about the people who are around, care for them, show them love, and I'm sure they will understand that you are something really different from [what] others are.<br><font color="blue"><b>2000-1203 Talk to Sahaja Yogis, You Must Realize Your Own Personal Responsibility, Āśhram, 4950 Read Road, Moorpark (48 miles from Los Angeles), CA, U.S.A.</b></font><br>
