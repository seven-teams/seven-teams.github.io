"<b>Guadalupe Lucio</b>: You were friend of Gāndhīs?

<font color="red"><b>Śhrī Mātājī</b></font>: No, I was ... I'm much younger to him. I was a little girl of seven years uh when he asked My father to leave Me with him. And I stayed with him, as a little girl. And he was a very sweet person as a uh uh elderly grandfather, I should say, and very wise man too and extremely gentle with children, extremely gentle. And he saw something in Me. He used to ask many questions about subtle things about life and uh I could guide him on certain points, like he asked Me how to put the different uh prayers. So, "According to the different centers," I told him, "you put it." So first is that of the first center, then of the cen... second center, like that. And that's how he arranged all of them. Like that he would. He had realized that I had something special about Me."<br>

"Like, they asked Mahātmā Gāndhī: "Why don't you become a Christian if you believe Christ?" He said, "All right, I'm willing! But tell me which Church? [Laughter.] What Church should I join?" And the person who asked kept quiet."<br>

"I must say I was with Mahātmā Gāndhī and also with Lal Bahadur Shastri, very-very close. Both were realized Souls.<br>
And Gāndhījī always told Me that: "Unless and until we are free we cannot talk of Sahaja Yoga."<br>
But when we became free you know how many problems came to our country, and he was no more.<br>
Then came another disciple of him, Lal Bahadur Shastri, born on the same date, to same style.<br>
But Gāndhījī was an austere man, very austere, I mean he is [a] character.<br>
I lived with him, I remember so many beautiful moments with him. He used to call Me Nepālī, always. And the, because I was very young, I was a child, so he would listen to Me. Otherwise, he would be angry with people for doing something wrong. And the very strict, you see, 'Get up four o'clock, you have your bath, go for a walk,' all these things.<br>
But he was such an [a] great person. Without his disciplining, we could never have won our freedom. And disciplined in his own life.<br>
Uh ... I met him just one day before his death. Vya, I really can't understand, why people should kill anybody like that. He was such a great Soul.<br>
Same with Lal Bahadur Shastri, I was very close to him. He was another realized Soul and he also said that, 'Let me settle down, then we'll start Sahaja Yoga very well." So [he] discussed with Me about this thing.<br>
But one thing common been both of them was this, very common, was that: 'The principle of every religion is the same, that you must get your Self-realization. The essence of every religion is the same. There's nothing to fight. There's nothing to fight.'<br>
And their Bhajanāwalī if you read, you see, that also, under My consultation, he [Mahātmā Gāndhī] did it according to the chakras.<br>
It was really so great. These two people, I mean I was so close to [them].<br>
Normally, if you go close to any one of these big people, you want to run away because they are not big at all.<br>
But Gāndhījī and Lal Bahadur Shastri were two great persons, I must say, being very close to them.<br>
And they wanted that this, somehow I should find out a way, a method, by which en mass Realization could be given. And I found it in uh-uh-uh ... the year nineteen seventy [1970], I found it. But by that time both were not there. Still, it worked out."<br>
