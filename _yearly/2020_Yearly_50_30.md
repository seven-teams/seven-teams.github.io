"Now, this faith is not yet established in many Sahaja Yogis in the West. If this faith could be established by even logical conclusions, then you can start experimenting with yourself. And you will be amazed how much powers you have got.<br> 
.....<br>
All this vanity just drops out, should drop out. Because vanity is the biggest barrier. And you yourself become your own reflection, your own reflector, and you can see clearly what you are in Sahaj Yog, and what you were, and what you have to be. And then you can ascend with the help of your love for your Mother, and it it happens that you can grow very fast.<br> 
.....<br>
Not only that you have to get your positions as Sahaja Yogis in the Kingdom of God, but you have to become the instruments, the great instruments of God.<br>
.....<br>
This is the problem with Sahaja Yogis: that they do not understand that there is no way you can return back in a position where you can say that, 'I am not realized.' But now you are realized and you'll have no, no excuse: you must grow, you must become what you have been given, otherwise we ... you will be thrown away, just like rejected ... rejected, rejected china [laughing:] as you have, and cannot be sold any more.<br>
.....<br>
That's how, in Sahaja Yoga, one has to grow very fast if you have to attract other people, because spontaneity is the only thing that is the capital we have got. We have no other capital to cash, only this spontaneous love.<br>
.....<br>
So, in Sahaj Yog, whatever is to be done is not to be done mentally, that's one thing people don't realize. Everything we do mentally."<br>
