<font size="+2"><b>You Should Be Proud That You Are Sahaja Yogis</b><br></font>
</p>

<p>
"I could not believe, about ten years back, that within ten years I'll be able to achieve this result. We should not judge the progress of Sahaja Yoga in relation to other plastic gurus. Even to create one Saint will require thousand lives to pass through. And so many have become Prophets, is a very big thing for you. Let us forget about what dents we have within ourselves. We have to know that we are Prophets. This assumption has to be established: that we are Prophets. If you could just assume what you are, what you have become, you'll emit the glory of God.<br>
......<br>
So, Sahaja Yogis can't afford to have these six enemies. First of all, the temper which really doesn't behove [behoove], compassion: replace temper with compassion. Today is sixty birthdays and we have to just fight only six enemies within ourselves. Second is, which you have most of you have done, is to retract your attention from perversion. Most of you have done it. Your eyes are better now, steady. But still you are egoistical. Vanity. Still people are jealous, competitive. You still have some lurking materialism. A new thing that is coming: you're getting attached to your families.<br>
......<br>
Then the vanity must be made into pride. You should be proud that you are Sahaja Yogis, real[ly] proud. Raise you heads with pride that, 'We are Sahaja Yogis.' Pride is never oppressive: it's a glorious thing to be proud. But vanity is -- actually, pride is nothing but the expression of self-esteem. Begging, borrowing, mimicary [mimicry], all these things come from the less understanding of yourself. So vanity should be the pride, and the pride should be the expression of self-esteem. Self-esteem is very different from ego: one is reality, another is complete artificiality.<br>
......<br>
So the self-esteem will give you that kind of a dynamism which is needed for Sahaj Yog, a discreet dynamism, a wise dynamism. I won't have to solve your problems any more.<br>
......<br>
There should be no competition between Sahaja Yogis in acquisition. Sometimes I have seen also competition in shouting, screaming, and being harsh to others -- there is a big competition on. Let us have competition in compassion, in mildness, in sweetness, in beautiful behavior. 'Who is more cultured? Who is more gentlemanly? Who is deeper?' Keep somebody an ideal before you, like that, whom you think is a very gentlemanly person or a lady who is really like a lady.<br>
......<br>
So the relationship, at this time, is the most important is of Sahaja Yoga and Sahaja Yogis. I have seen some Sahaja Yogis write to their parents, to their mothers, to their brothers, much more than they write to the other Sahaja Yogis. Is very amazing! To their fathers but not to other Sahaja Yogis. You must start writing to other Sahaja Yogis.<br>
......<br>
Declare to all the nations now that, 'I am the Holy Ghost and I have come for this special time, that is the Resurrection Time.'"<br>
