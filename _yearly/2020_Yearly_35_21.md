"So this is true not only of Hindus, also of Jains, also of Christianity, also of Islam, the way it is preached today is all adharma. There is no dharma in it.<br>
That's why the establishment of our Dharma is very important, which is the Pure Religion which gives you ascent, joy, peace, and the blessings of God. This is what is Vishwa Nirmala Dharm."<br>
