</p>

<p>
"So the Śhiv Pūjā meant that you become love and feel the joy of love.<br>
......<br>
So, to cleanse yourself and to be open is the best way to enjoy life. Some people may laugh at you, some may make fun of you, some may try to trouble you. But most of them will love you because you are so pure, and you will be yourself at peace with yourself.<br>
......<br>
So when we say, `We are in Paradise,' actually the people in Paradise just enjoy. [Laughter.] They know that they are looked after by the Divine Power. Also they know that they don't have to worry about anything. Also they know that everything will work out by itself. This is how a Sahaja Yogi should be.<br>
Actually is you are Sahaja Yogis, but actually you are now on your way to Mahāyogi[s]."<br>
