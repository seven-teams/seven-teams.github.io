<font size="+2"><b>Perfect Knowledge About Sahaja Yoga You Should Have</b><br></font>
</p>

<p>
"And I told you that we have to understand that this is the greatest moment in the history, while you are born, and you are doing the highest work, that is of God, here. And you are specially chosen for it and how you must know that you are a Saint.<br>
......<br>
And today I find the negativity is also hurting Sahaja Yoga, very much, and Sahaja Yogis, through a very subtle method.<br>
......<br>
So in Sahaja Yoga, you can be misled very much, by so many things.<br>
......<br>
Specially it is very much in Europe, I find, and England and America: the women have become very dominant. And they know how to control men by telling them stories about how to look after the family, how to look after the children, how to do that. Sometimes is amazing! And you get lost with it. <br>
......<br>
Here, the women lack intelligence because they are so aggressive. They do not see the point! They do not understand who I am! They do not understand, `What is our worth?' To them, all nonsensical stupid things are important. Not all of you but some of you.<br>
......<br>
Now women have to understand they are women because they are compassionate, they are forbearing. They are like this Mother Earth.<br>
Their ego is so developed! Be careful about it!<br>
Why America is finished today? Because of their women.<br>
......<br>
This is a very common failing of the West! And I don't know what has happened to the men here, they feel so guilty, that they must become like slaves!<br>
......<br>
You have to be absolutely perfect, in perfect health. And perfect knowledge about Sahaja Yoga you should have!<br>
......<br>
I'm requesting you now, because you are the śhakti. You are the power behind the man. You are the one who are going to make them great. You are the one who are going to build up Sahaja Yoga as a potential energy. <br>
......<br>
In the marriage of Sahaja Yoga, you have given a promise to Me: that you'll work for Sahaja Yoga, and you'll help your husband in doing Sahaja Yoga, you'll help your husband when he's looking after other Sahaja Yogis, and you'll look after other Sahaja Yogis who come to your house. You'll make your house a Sahaja Yoga center, receive the people in your house, and will always try to enhance the collectivity. Under these promises you are married.<br>
So, now, coming to the major problems of the world, we have seen that I am talking about politics quite a lot these days, and maybe one day all of you have to enter into politics when the proper time has come.<br>
......<br> 
But today the problems are much deeper than what we think of. A kind of a negative force, like a Hitler's force, is rising up through women of all the countries. Through women this horrible Hitler and all his Germans who died are taking birth. They are becoming like ... now, just like Nazis. <br>
......<br>
And I have to specially make a very important request to the women, that, in these modern times, they are the ones who are going to save the world, ot the men! They have done their job before. Now it is for you to save: with your understanding, with your compassion, with your sacrifices, with your wisdom. And the innate love: not only your children, your husband, your family, but the whole world."<br>

<b>Objectives:</b><br>
9. To create a new generation of self-realized people and to render motherly protection to all such children against evil intentions and to look after their well-being.<br>
13. To employ the energy of love to overcome hatred that is the cause of wars, disintegration and destruction by publishing and relating the spiritual experiences of Sadhakas which prove the universal laws of love.
