"You all know so much about it, that I need not tell you, but what you have to know is that: She came on this Earth to save you from all kinds of troubles. For Her you were important, very important, because you were doing Devī Pūj. And so we are celebrating today this Devī Pūjā, with all our heart, because whatever ill people did to you, She came to destroy them. So today is a very great day for you to thank Her: thank Her for Her protection and for Her understanding as to what you have been tortured for."<br>
