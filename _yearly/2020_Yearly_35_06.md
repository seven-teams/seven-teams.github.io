"Today I was thinking that uh we'll do the Pūjā to Mahālakṣhmī, would be better, so that we'll understand what is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma is.<br>
......<br>
Vishwa Nirmala Dharma, which is based on the Mahālakṣhmī Principle, is the essence of all the religions, the truth of all the religions. And we seek with our pursuits what are the common points in all these religions. We try to neutralize which are not common points and find out with our research, pursuits that, `This one was not the correct thing, but is not in the religion, [just] people are following like that.'<br>
Because we are Seekers of Truth, we do not belong to any country, we belong to the universe: Vishwa Nirmala Dharma. ...... While it is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma, means it is a Universal Religion: `We belong to the universe. We are part and parcel of the universe, not only belonging to one place or one location.'<br>
......<br>
It's of [a] principle that is so detached. It is the nourishing principle within us, which nourishes our centers, which nourishes our characters, which nourishes our religion, that is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.>br>
