"So, you have to give up your mind. Somebody else should work it out: the Divine.<br>
......
This is the secret of your Mother's māyā, also. This is the secret of your Mother's māyā: 'That I live on limited plane, and do unlimited things. That's how I create māyā.'<br>
......<br>
And this is what one should know that our foundations have been made very weak, by [the] satanic force. Our foundations are very weak.<br>
We have been given all these ideas for days in and day out. The satanic forces have built it up since long! Since long these ideas have been built up.<br>
......<br>
You have to rebuild your foundations. So the foundations on which you stand, you [must] change them completely: you have new foundations of dhārmik life. Absolutely you have to accept dhārmik life in your life, that's the way only your foundations can be good.<br>
......<br>
You have to build new ideals, in the Western countries. Then only you can change it. Because you are such a dynamic force.<br>
Every one of you have to come up to build yourself into ideals! And try to lead a life of that ideal within you. You have to sacrifice! The greatest thing that you have to sacrifice is your ego, which makes you so obstinate and hard-hearted. Face yourself up! This ideal has to be created. There's someone sitting before you, if you want to accept, which is a very difficult life this side: that, one has to have compassion, one has to have love, understanding.<br>
......<br>
But you are your own ideals. You have to create new ideals. You are the new presidents of America and the prime ministers of England. You are the one who are great people, nd you have to stand up to it: people of character, of integrity, of hard work, proper understanding. Otherwise, you cannot do anything. You have to come up!<br>
.......<br>
Every one of you is capable of doing that.<br>
Every one of you has to become a leader.<br>
......<br>
So channelize yourself properly, cleanse yourself properly, and dedicate.<br>
......<br>
I don't care [about] your protocols and your ritualistic things, are nonsense for Me. What does it matter for Me? The one who loves others is the one who really loves Me. Take it from Me. I have had all these rituals and all that and I have no care for these things. Makes no difference whether you say, 'Good morning' to Me or, 'Good evening' to Me, it's not important. What you say to your brothers and sisters is the most important thing."<br>

<b>Objectives:</b><br>
20. To counteract through mass spiritual power the destructive forces against spiritualism such as evil spirits, the cult of hypnotism, siddhis and the use of "religion" for the exploitation of the innocent.<br>
21. To unite all genuine Seekers of Truth divided by dogmas and ignorance so that Satya Yuga (the Age of Truth) is born out of the present Kali Yuga (the Age of Darkness) rather than complete annihilation. To harness all the human resources to achieve this great task for which mass evolution will be needed.
