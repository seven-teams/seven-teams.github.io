"But you are Sahaja Yogis and you have to construct yourself. I didn't want to shatter your egos before, never to tell you in these words. Perhaps this is the first time I am saying this to you: that you have to dedicate yourself completely to Me, not to Sahaj Yog but to Me. Sahaja Yoga jist ... is just one of My aspects. Leaving everything, you have to dedicate. Complete dedication, otherwise you cannot ascend any further. Without questioning, without arguing, complete dedication is the only way you can achieve it.<br> 
People still get caught up, still get into problems, wha[t']s the reason? So many people ask Me: ``That once we have got Realization, how is it Mother we go down?" The only reason is: the dedication is not complete. Is complete reverence and complete dedication has been not established. You st-still do not know that I am Divine, to that extent as you should."<br>
