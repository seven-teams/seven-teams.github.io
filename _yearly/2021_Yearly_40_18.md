"So the discretion should be, 'We have to bring up our children according to Sahaj Culture.'<br>
The first of the principles of Sahaja Yoga is fortitude.<br>
Sahaja Yoga is not meant for such dainty darlings. You have to be soldiers of Sahaj Yoga. Your children have to be the soldiers of Sahaja Yoga, not the dainty darlings. Is not meant for them. Though they are born realized, you are ruining them by making them dainty darlings. You have to rough it out. You have to make them sturdy. You have to give them self-respect. You have to give them dignity and a fortitude, forbearance.<br>
......<br>
Gṛuhalakṣhmī is the woman who should know that she has the great responsibility of creating a very great society of Sahaja Yoga. She's not an ordinary woman. How women ... how many women got their Realization before?<br>
......<br>
So, Sahaja Yoga is meant for women who are alert, who are wise, who know everything about life.<br>
Even they don't know, where are the chakras on the feet. Look at your Mother: She's a woman! She knows so much. They don't know anything as to how Kuṇḍalinī passes through these centers, what It does, what She is capable of.<br>
But the Kuṇḍalinī Itself is the Feminine Power. She knows each and everything about you, about Her child.<br>
......<br>
So the discretion is: that you have to be like a queen, and the husband has to be like a king. But not like the king who killed his seven wives. But like a king who respects his wife.<br>
If you cannot respect your wife, you cannot be a Sahaja Yogi. Respect is different from being romantically in love. I think that you don't respect. To respect your wife is a very important thing in Sahaj Yog.<br>
......<br>
So, there has to be the self-disciplination, as you can so call it, on the Haṃsa chakra, which is the one which knows what is right, what is wrong, through which we work it out: 'Whatever is the right, that's all we do! Otherwise we don't do whatever is wrong.'<br>
......<br>
So Viśhuddhi is a very, very important center. And for you Americans, specially, American Sahaja Yogis, you have to know that to be in the Viśhuddhi means you are in char-ge-dj-dj. Not doing anything, but in charge.<br>
......<br>
So the training of the tongue.<br>
Then wha... what you speak, what do you say? Are you just chatting?<br>
You are a Sahaja Yogi! Every word you say is a mantra!<br>
These Āśhrams are much higher and greater than all the āśhrams of the world, even Gāndhījī's āśhram. "<br>
