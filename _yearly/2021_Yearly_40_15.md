</p>

<p>
"So first, He is the One who is innocence, who is an eternal child. And He appears first on the first chakra of Mūlādhāra, and there He's called as Śhrī Gaṇeśh, where the carbon atom was made, carbon.<br>
And that is very important to understand that Gaṇeśha is the symbol of innocence. And Mother Earth is the Power of that Deity, Gaṇeśha.<br>
So, it was Gaṇeśha, later on incarnated on this Earth as Christ, and He will be incarnated again as Eleven Rudras, means Ekādeśhas [Ekādaśhas], or we can call Him as Niṣhkalaṅka, His name will be, when He will just sort out things in a sense that He will just cut the people out who are not realized, who are no good, and the rest of them will ascend in the Kingdom of Heaven. This is what is the Last Ascent.
......<br>
After Realization, you can ... you become yourself the essence. You can awaken the essence. Like you can control everything: you can control the rain, you can control the wind, everything you can control. But that is the Higher Awareness where you rise, is called as Cosmic Awareness. Now, only the Collective Awareness is within you. Once that comes into you, you can do that also, whenever, to whatever is necessary. Even your presence itself ...<br>
Now, when I am ... I come to a place it rains always. Then it there is sun, always, whenever I travel. And then the day I am going the sky is always filled with clouds. It's a common principle, a crommenon [common] phenomena it's going to. I don't do anything, just automatically they [Devatas] do it.<br>
......<br>
Christ had also a donkey, as a very humble thing. That shows that: there's no need to show off with Rolls-Royces and things people try."<br>
