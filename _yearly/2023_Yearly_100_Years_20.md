"Every time it's such a beautiful surprise to see how Sahaja Yogis are getting one with the Divine. The expression of their joy, the conception of the Divine, you can see very clearly.<br>
This is how I want you all to sit in the Kingdom of God as I am sitting today.<br>
[After 12 seconds:] We have to realize: that we are now the part and parcel of that Cosmic Consciousness Itself. The Brahma. The One that creates, which coordinates, which plans into all the details, and the One that loves through Its creation, through Its expression, is that Cosmic Consciousness.<br> 
......<br>
That Cosmic Consciousness is the Param Tattwa, is the Principle of all the Principles, controls all the principles. So it controls also the Principles of all these Five Elements. It controls the Mana Śhakti. It controls the evolution and gives you the power to evolve others. So, this great Brahma Śhakti is at your lotus feet. 
......<br>
You are eternal bliss and awareness. The consciousness, the pure consciousness."<br>
