"And today, as a first time, I would say again, to begin with, that I'm talking of Ocean of Love.<br>
If you were so perfect there was no need to have Sahaj Yog. There was no need to do anything. Should have been the simplest job, you see. Anybody could have done it.<br>
Because there are complications and problems, that somebody has to work it out.<br>
......<br>
Now, today we have, in our presence, Mister [Bhaskarrao G.] Pradhan, who is now seventy-six.<br>
And the he came to Me about twelve months ... twelve years back or eleven years back. He belongs to the first batch of Sahaja Yogis.<br> 
And I've worked on them, about twenty-five of them, for two years. And after two years, only twelve of them got Realization. After two years, can you believe it? He's one of them.<br>
And the he is now going to America, because I'll be going to America so he wants to go and pave way for Me. He has come all the way from India.<br>
He is a lawyer, he's a[n] advocate, and he has held a very great understanding of Sahaja Yoga.<br>
He's helped Me a lot. Last time when I went to America also he came down.<br>
And he is our trustee. For we had to have a trust in India. Uh you cannot even get a hall without a trust. Then we had a trust.<br>
And ... uh-uh-uh, today there's a good news, that somebody has given us donation of one acre of land in Powai Lake area which is a very beautiful area, in addition to what that they had given us.<br>
So, I don't know, maybe that people who want to now have places there, they could come and meditate and sit down. So it's little far away from Bombay [Mumbai], about, say, that is about eight miles or so. That's a very, very quiet area, very quiet area and there's, there are two lakes there. Is [a] very nice place.<br>
And today only I received the message saying that somebody has donated that. I was very happy that they have donated us because we could not buy any, any land, because I said that, "We'll not give any black money or any bribery or anything, and the land has to be proper price. We'll not give extra money, would be public money." But some or other, now we've got some land there."<br>
