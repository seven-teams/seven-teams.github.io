"Muhammad Sāhab said, "Heaven lies at the Feet of the Mother." There is nothing beyond them, meditate on them. Day and night they work very hard to absorb your ego. Look at My Feet, how swollen they are, but I cannot stop them from absorbing your catches because they are very compassionate."<br>

"Even Muhammad Sāhab has said: that, "Paradise lies at the Feet of the Mother!"<br>
In the Gospel of Thomas, he writes, authentically: Christ said, that, "This is the Mother who has bore Me in Her womb. But I have another One with a great M capital." "<br>
