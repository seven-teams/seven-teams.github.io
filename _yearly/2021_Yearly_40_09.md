</p>

<p>
"Today, we have assembled here to worship Śhi... Sadāśhiva, which is reflected within us as Śhiva, as the Spirit.<br> 
He is reflected in our heart. And as you have seen, that the goal of our life was to achieve this State of Spirit.<br>
......<br>
So to enjoy Sahaja Yoga you must know that is not dry vibrations only, but is the bhakti. That is the joy of Śh-Śhiva's quality, the quality of joy, that He adds to our life. <br>
......<br>
Who are your relations? Are Sahaja Yogis, remember this. Is a sentence you must remember: 'My relations are Sahaja Yogis only.' `And anybody who plays against Sahaja Yogis, troubles Sahaja Yogis, that person could be my own wife, could be my own child, is not mine.' Cause I'll not allow such a thing to happen. This relationship is all right till Sahaja Yogis are one with each other. As soon as somebody tries to harm any other Sahaja Yogi, then I'm not with that person.<br>
......<br>
But in Sahaja Yoga, Sahaja Yoga has much deeper work to do: it has to penetrate into the society, into the political life, into economic life. You have to emancipate the whole world. Try to understand your responsibility. You are not only here for one ascetic ascent, no. How much wisdom you must have, how much love you must have, and how much discrimination you must have, to understand that you are chosen for the emancipation of the whole world.<br>
So now this so-called limited love, what is the solution, which takes you to destruction? Is the Unlimited Love. Because Śhiva is nothing but Love, He's Love. Love is that corrects, that nourishes, that wants your benevolence. That's what Śhiva is. It wants your benevolence. It looks after your benevolence. "<br>
