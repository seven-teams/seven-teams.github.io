"Togliatti people are, I must say, are very fast in Sahaja Yoga. And to do this for children is the most important. So many bad influences are crawling into Russia and we have to save our children and protect them. With Sahaja Yoga Principle and behavior, I'm sure they'll be great Sahaja Yogis tomorrow. Very soon they will know how to give Realization to people. [Looking to the translator:] You [adult Sahaja Yogis] already must be knowing it.<br>
These are the flowers of your country. You have to look after them and create beautiful fruits out of it. Their innocence must be preserved. Must respect children. You shouldn't never beat children, there's no need to beat them. Or even to scold them. On the contrary, a rapport must be established. You must talk to them about stories of good people. This will definitely expose them to righteousness and to morality. Thus you can preserve the tradition of your country. I am sure one day they'll be great Sahaja Yogis and will do great work for Sahaja Yoga. Will you be?<br>

School Children: Dа [yes]!"<br>
