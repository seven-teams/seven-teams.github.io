"It's a fact is: we do not know ourselves.<br>
......<br>
So the first thing is: you have to have ... you have to have the experience. Whatever people may say, 'This is wrong,' 'That is good,' is not the point. The point is: 'Did you get the experience on your fingertips? Did you get the experience out of your fontanel bone area?'<br>
......<br>
Now this Kuṇḍalinī is the one, She makes your connection with that Torsion Area. She is the One that gives you that that power to know Absolute Knowledge, Absolute Knowledge. And you know the reality of everything.<br>
......<br>
Now you have to promise Me one thing: for this, to promise Me that you will grow in Sahaj Yog. You'll become a very big tree, not a small little plant, and you will help the world to come to this Paradise of heavenly blessings. This is ... should be your promise to Me.<br>
You can do it, I know you can do it. If I could do, I would not request you.<br>
But I am requesting you: that you have to go deep down into yourself and see that you have got this great treasure, and you must develop it."<br>
