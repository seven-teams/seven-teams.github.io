<font size="+2"><b>The Testimony Of The Truth</b><br></font>
</p>

<p>
"Today you have arranged this worship of your Guru, that is your Mother. Perhaps you are very unique people that have a Guru who is a Mother.<br>
......<br>
The Pūjā is arranged because you have been initiated into the Statutes of the Lord. You have been told what are the dharmas of a human being.<br>
......<br>
The guru has to be a complete personality to talk about these Statutes and to elevate his disciples to this level of understanding, by which they imbibe those Statutes.<br>
......<br>
Let's see what are the Statutes. First is: 'You do not harm anyone.' First principle is that we are not to harm anyone.<br>
......<br>
The second Statute is that you have to stu ... stand on your own legs and know that you are here one with the Truth, the testimony. The testimony of the Truth: that you have seen the Truth, you know what Truth is, and you cannot compromise with falsehood, you cannot.<br>
......<br>
The third thing for a guru, in Sahaja Yoga has to do, is to develop detachment.<br>
......<br>
Now the fourth thing, the fourth Statute of the Lord is: 'To lead a moral life.' "<br>
