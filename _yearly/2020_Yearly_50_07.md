</p>

<p>
"Apart from that we understand the relationship between science and Sahaj Yog, between economics and Sahaj Yog, between politics and Sahaj Yog, between physics and Sahaja Yoga and between so many other branches of knowledge with Sahaj Yog, because they are also part and parcel of human beings. We start understanding psychology through Sahaj Yog in a new way. We start understanding all the Scriptures of the world, because everything is enlightened and we understand Sahaj Yog. But we ha... do not become fully that, which we have to be. We do not fully manifest our Spirit. If so, we will be completely in joy.<br>
......<br>
There's nothing to analyze in Sahaja Yoga, it is the synthesis. So, what we have to do: is to feel it more within us and establish that thoughtless awareness.<br>
......<br>
Even in Sahaja Yoga one has to be careful. It is a mission, but it is not a mission of missionaries. It is the mission of lovers, those who love, those who love human beings. Nothing is more important than Love in Sahaj Yog."<br>
