Dear All,<br>
<br>
We would like to announce that this year the weekly celebrations will be centered on 50 Years of Sahaja Yoga in UK (and implicitly in the Western World).<br>
Please kindly refer to the new Divine Event (as the second sample out of 16) started by the CCT at the link <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/events/1974-0101"> <font color="DeepPink"><b>1974-0101 Arrival, Airport, London, UK</b></font></a>.<br> 
<br>
We hope very much that you will follow and enjoy all the posts.<br>
<br>
If you would like to contribute or to join our little team, please let us know asap.<br>
<br>
Jay Śhrī Mātājī!<br>
