"The other day, on the radio, they asked [a] very nice question, which I think I should handle first. And the question was: ``What is the difference between other sects and Sahaja Yoga?" It's a very good question because it gives you a relative idea as to what is reality, and what is not.<br>
First of all, we should see what is the need of Sahaj Yog.<br>
......<br>
Now, what is Sahaja Yoga? In Sahaja Yoga what actually happens to a personality is this: that the sleeping power, or we can say unawakened power within you, which is your germinating power, rises, passes through the various s-subtle centers within you, and pierces through this fontanel area, and, what we call it, as a Baptism, as a blessing or the Grace of the Holy Ghost, you get your Realization. It's a happening, it's actualization, it is living, it is living. It is the blessing of the Living God, not of an artificial one.<br>
......<br>
What is the need to be the Spirit? We are all right as human beings, as flesh, everything: what is the need to be realized? And once you understand the need, then you will understand what is Sahaja Yoga, and what the other sects are.<br>
The need is this: that you are a part and parcel of the whole.<br>
......<br>
But Sahaja Yoga is a collective thing.<br>
......<br>
This is awareness and this is collectivity. And those who cannot rise to collectivity cannot be good Sahaja Yogis.<br>
......<br>
But this collectivity is to be understood in its own dimensions in Sahaja Yoga. This is the second task of Sahaja Yoga, which is more difficult than the first one.<br>
......<br>
So, Sahaja Yoga is a system which is the System of the Nature. "<br>
