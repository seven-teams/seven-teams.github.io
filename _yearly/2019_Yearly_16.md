</p>

<p>
"Innocence is the source of love. Like small children, when you see them sweetly dancing, you feel such tremendous love for them. When you see a little baby, very sweet baby smiling at you, you feel tremendous love for that child. If you do not respect your innocence, you can never be [a] loving person. And without love you cannot know lo... Truth. 

Only thing is that we feel rather sometimes awkward, sometimes frightened to love the innocent people. The innocent are most harmless people. I do not like parents to beat their children at all. They are in innocence do something, so you must be really kind to them and understand them."<br>
