<font size="+2"><b></b>The Spirit Tells You What Is The Truth<br></font>
</p>

<p>
"These two have to meet. They are separated. The Spirit within you, and the Holy Ghost within you, have to meet. That is the Yoga, that's the Union.<br>
......<br>
The Spirit Itself is Sat-chit-ānanda. He e... exists in the State of Truth.<br>
Now, we do not know what Truth is. People say, 'God is Love, God is Truth.' Now what is the Truth? <br>
The Truth is this All-pervading Power. And this All-pervading Power is the nature of the Spirit, which gives you the Absolute Knowledge. Now mark it: Absolute Knowledge.<br>
......<br>
So the first thing you are: you are the Truth! The Spirit tells you what is the Truth. It tells you everything about everything. It is the Truth! The Knowledge that is pure is the Truth!  
......<br>
So the Truth is: everything is illusion, except for the Divine Love of God that is all-pervading, which you can feel through your Spirit.<br>
This power has got telecommunication, It has got all that you have created in the science, It can coordinate and cooperates. It has got all the angels and all the great Souls to help It, and to look after you. And the top, topping the whole thing, is the quality that It loves! It loves you.<br>
So It doesn't come to you like a sword. It gives you the time to improve, to judge yourself, to rise, to grow, just as a mother would look after her child, forgive mistakes, see that the child rises, and grows into complete manhood.<br>
So it is Love! And the love that is so powerful is the Truth. And it never fails. It never fails.<br>
......<br>
The second thing: the nature of Spirit is that He's Chitta, He's the attention. He's the attention means: when you become spiritually enlightened, your attention becomes enlightened.<br>
......<br>
Then the third thing happens: is the [laughing:] joy! That you are in joy all the time. You cannot keep serious for more than two minutes. Is very difficult to keep serious.<br> 
......<br>
May God bless you to blossom into the beauties of your Spirit, so that you glorify your Father, and He feels glorified with His Gracious Love towards you."<br>

<b>Objectives:</b><br>
13. To employ the energy of love to overcome hatred that is the cause of wars, disintegration and destruction by publishing and relating the spiritual experiences of Sadhakas which prove the universal laws of love.<br>
20. To counteract through mass spiritual power the destructive forces against spiritualism such as evil spirits, the cult of hypnotism, siddhis and the use of "religion" for the exploitation of the innocent.<br>
