<font size="+2"><b>The Sahaja Yogis Have To Speak Like William Blake</b><br></font>
</p>

<p>
"Many people do not understand Him because He wrote it, according to them, in abstract language, or in the language that He understood. But I am happy that Sahaja Yogis understand Him so well.<br>
......<br>
And to Me He's very great: because He said all these things, He prepared the stage for Sahaj Yog. <br>
......<br>
You have to speak like Him. The Sahaja Yogis have to speak like William Blake. The way He spoke about His great country, about the soil in which He was born, about the people who will be born here, who will be Sahaja Yogis, He's described them so well: that men of God will be born on this soil. Men of God: special people, the chosen ones.<br>

"Sahaja Yoga came on this Earth [a] long time back, much before I came on this Earth, and today it has come to England. We should say, I came here twelve years back.<br>
It took fourteen years for Blake to write Jerusalem. And I think, after fourteen years if ... also if I could really feel satisfied that I've been able to do some justice to Him in this Jerusalem that He wanted to build, I'll beif [be] very much grateful to you all.<br>
But's not so! It's a very disappointing thing! People don't want to listen anything! They want to listen to something that they like, that you have to pay o... play on their weaknesses, all the time tell them that, `Whatever wrong you are doing is a good thing, go ahead with it.' "<br>
