<b>Gavin Brown</b>: Mother, today is said it's Anant Chaturdaśhī.<br>
<font color="red"><b>Śhrī Mātājī</b></font>: Huh?<br>
<b>Gavin Brown</b>:: Anant Chaturdaśhī.<br>
<font color="red"><b>Śhrī Mātājī</b></font>: Today? Aah-ha! That's great! Yes must be. I was wondering Anant Chaturdaśhī. Anant Chaturdaśhī is the day when we visarjan, dissolve Śhrī Gaṇeśha in the water. Gaṇeśhjī ko choṛate hai na pānī meṃ [it's that day we put Gaṇeśhjī in to the water]. Because He's established for ten days. And after ten days, He's born on the fourth, after ten days He's dissolved in the water so that everywhere His Power is spread through the water.<br> 
That's why no wonder there was a Pūjā. [Laughter.]<br>
Gaṇeśha settled down into the water. [Laughs.] That is Ananta Chaturdaśhī. Ananta is the, is Śhrī Gaṇeśha. Ananta means which cannot be destroyed. Innocence cannot be destroyed. And that is why is the Gaṇeśh Chaturdaśhī, means the day when Gaṇeśha is dissolved in the water, in the ocean or He is created, worshiped for ten days and again given back. So it's a very great day today, I should say, like the Resurrection of Christ that you are, you had Christ here, He lived with you, and then went back to His Father. Father is the ocean and that's what in India they do, to establish Him on the fourth day and on the tenth day they put Him back to the ocean. <br>

"So, the first thing is: that we should understand that Gaṇeśha gives us maryādās, limits. It is innate within us. Is not imposed on us, it is innate. <br>
......<br>
So we have to now understand what are our maryādās are, how we have to live within our maryādās, and I'm sure if you really work out your Śhrī Gaṇeśha.<br>
For that the best is to meditate. Put yourself on some nice uh-uh-uh turf, grass. Sit on that. Put your left hand with the light, and right hand on the Mother Earth, and say Atharva Śhīrṣh. If you can remember it by heart, it's a very good thing, otherwise you can keep the book, and read it, or say Gaṇeśha's mantra to begin with. Is going to help you very much. Is going to help you, your eyes, it's going to your whole thing, is going to be very nice.<br>
......<br>
So, is not a something very simple thing. It's very serious. For Sahaja Yogis is very, very serious. They have to revive their innocence. They have to revive their maryādās. They have to delimit themselves. It's very important.<br>
Otherwise, as I would say that, if you have some wheat spread out everywhere, now, how can you reach the heights? You have to put them into some bags, some maryādās.<br>
Only by maryādās you can rise.<br>
Of course the Kuṇḍalinī will help. Of course Gaṇeśha will help also. But we should also try to watch ourselves. There should be introspection: 'Are we still in the same category?' "<br>
