"It is such a pleasure today, and great fortune too, that here, where William Blake lived, and He sang those songs of greatness, of the greatness of this country, the future that it has to be, the dreams He saw, have now come to shape: that we are here to celebrate His anniversary. Things go beyond words and you cannot express yourself.<br>
Many people do not understand Him because He wrote it, according to them, in abstract language, or in the language that He understood. But I am happy that Sahaja Yogis understand Him so well.<br>
And the prophesies that He made about England, people used to riducule [ridicule], ridicule it. Even today they can't believe that Jerusalem can be built in England. They cannot believe that people who have been all their lives, for ages together, thought of nothing but materialism, can take to spirituality to this extent that it becomes Jerusalem, and that the whole world comes to pay homage to this Holy Land: that this becomes the Holy Land. Is a fact! He dreamt, He wished it. Because He knew the value of this land.<br>
This land has been touched by Christ's Feet.<br>
Since long, people knew about Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
Even if that is lost, for history, it remains it.<br>
And He knew about it, He spoke about it.<br>
In His lifetime, maybe, people never understood Him: He ... they must have thought that, 'He's really a madman, or something, a fantasy, or some sort of a poet,' who doesn't understand.<br>
For what He wrote, every word of it, is the Truth.<br>
Such a great Soul should live, in Hampstead itself, is such a blessing. Great blessing."<br>

"It is such a[n] honor for all of us to pay this homage to the great poet, printer and a Prophet that was William Blake.<br>
......<br>
When I read Him, I am amazed at His s-s-sense of humor: how He openly comes out with such remarks. I feel He is like Mārkaṇḍeya in India, or Kabīr Dās in India, who slashed the whole society with their sword all the time to see that they are brought to the proper shape, without fear. But so gentle. If you read the song of the '[Book of] Thel' [by Śhrī William Blake], is so gentle.<br>
And all of them, who were Him perhaps or are of the same style, [were] extremely open, straightforward, you can say even blatant and extremely gentle.br>
......<br>
Traditionally we have known for thousands of years!<br>
I talk of Mārkaṇḍeya, who was there twelve thousand years back! Who incarnated here as William Blake. Twelve thousand years back He said the same thing which is said in England after twelve thousand years, because that time I don't know what was here! Maybe only jungles, I think.<br>
And that is also waste! Isn't it? Tell Me, isn't it?"<br>
