"All these qualities are there but I think there are certain other things which have crawled up and a ... maybe that's one of the reasons we have to guard against if you have to keep to Sahaj Yoga, if you have to grow in Sahaj Yog.<br>
......<br>
You are a class Sahaj Yogi means in your content, within yourself, you have such powers that you can face yourself happily and you enjoy yourself, you know your Self. That is what is a class in Sahaja Yoga, not uh but how you dress up or how you talk or you hold your forks, fork and spoons, is not the way. So, this style that we think of is no substitute for the contents. <br>
......<br>
If you are a Sahaj Yogi, then you should be able to enjoy everything: every small thing you should enjoy.<br>
......<br>
So one thing is: we are not any more English, or UK Sahaj Yogis, we are Sahaj Yogis of the God's Kingdom.<br>
......<br>
So this is one of the things we must cut out that, 'We have no other styles but Sahaja Yoga style,' is to laugh, to talk, to embrace everyone and to be joyous. That's what we are. Because we know the knowledge, we are Gnostics. They [we] are not stupid blind people, who would wear their aah black hats to go to church and sit over all the tombs there. We know such a lot!<br>
So this is first thing: that we have no styles, no styles of any kind.<br>
......<br>
The whole attitude is that we have to get mixed up with the whole Ocean of Sahaj Yogis.<br>
......<br>
The quality of Sahaja Yoga should be within us: 'How many people we can give Realization? How many people we can talk to? How much do we know about Sahaja Yoga? How much we have mastered it? How many people we can get into Sahaja Yoga? Can we?'<br>
......<br>
We have come to Sahaja Yoga to become great people."<br>
