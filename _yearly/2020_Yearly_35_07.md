"Simple things, I'll tell you what. They asked Me, ``Mother, what do You think of starting a Vishwa Nirmala Dharma in Melbourne?" I said, ``All right." I didn't know that is going to be an association, there is going to be an election and all, nothing. Just I said, ``All right." Just to start is all right.<br>
Vishwa Nirmala Dharma is everywhere, but they don't have any association, nothing. It's uh just a kind of a society, which is just spreading Vishwa Nirmala Dharma. There is, no uh sort of uh-uh any organization about it. We only have Trus[ts], and we don't want to have any election[eer]ing or all that.<br>
Again, if some wrong type of people get in, then Sahaja Yoga will be ousted completely. So you can only have Trust. And if you want to do something else you can form it separately, but it should not be Vishwa Nirmala Dharm or Sahaj Yoga. Nothing doing. Because I said, ``Yes," that doesn't mean that you should go that far with forming this, that, association, and all that. Is a ... is a news to Me. "<br>
