</p>

<p>
"Something special has happened to you: that, the whole of Brahmachaitanya, the whole Ocean, has taken the form of a cloud, that's Ādi Śhakti, and has come on this Earth to shower the Chaitanya on you people, enrich you, nurture you, develop you, by manifesting the love in such a manner that you have entered into the body of the Ādi Śhakti. <br>
So like one pitcher which is in the River Ganges, you are like a cell in the body of the Ādi Śhakti. Your entity, your personality is preserved. Despite that, you feel the Brahmachaitanya through your senses, and you can give Realizations to others. But you are in the body of the Ādi Śhakti. As long as you are in the boy ... body of Ādi Śhakti, you can do all that.<br>
This is the greatest thing that has happened: the whole of the Sahasrāra has opened out with all the seven Pīṭhas of all the Deities, who were just part and parcel of it. The whole of it has come in the form of a Mother who is humble, who is [smiling:] deceptive, illusive, who is Mahāmāyā. Is the greatest thing that could happen to human beings and to the whole universe: that, now, you can get your Realization, you can give Realizations to others, you can understand through your senses, through your logic what is vibrations, what it does.<br>
......<br>
First of all, I have taken you in My body. A foreign thing has to go in the body. And it has to be looked after, nurtured. But if you become troublesome, then you will be thrown out: I can't bear you.<br>
Some people are extremely troublesome. They do not meditate, they have their own ideas about meditation, they do not develop themselves, they do not mature, they live in the past or in the future, and such people are troublesome.<br>
......<br>
E ... it has to be [a] religious obligation that you must listen to Me, whatever I say. Actually you must obey Me! My hand obeys Me, My fingers obey Me, My Feet obey Me, what about you? Who are raised to the great dignity and the great position of being the Yogis in the body of the Ādi Śhakti, and they are acting as cells in My body.<br>
......<br>
And to keep Sahasrāra clear-cut, you must listen to whatever I have told you. Obey it as absolutely a[n] ordained thing.<br>
......<br>
Aggressiveness is one of the qualities in the West. And that also, is inherited by you people. They ... as soon as you put them onto something, they become aggressive.<br>
I can't bear it within Myself!<br>
......<br>
I've heard horrible stories about how some women, some men have become aggressive. With a little position they get, immediately they become aggressive.<br>
......<br>
This aggressivene... ...ness adds to the aggressiveness and ... of another person. Then reaction starts: one says something, the another says something. We become reactionaries! We haven't got something of our own, that we should be reactionaries‽<br>
There should be no reaction to anything!<br>
Because we have something of our own, why should we react to something, whatever people are doing to us, or have done to us? Is finished!<br>
Open your hearts!<br>
......<br>
Materialism! It's a ghost, it's a horrible devil, that has come onto the heads of Americans, and from them to all of us.<br>
This materialism is a horrible stuff. Is so ridiculous, shameful! Doesn't even suit a human person. Even a dog would hate such a materialism, to what level human beings have gone."<br>

<b>Objectives:</b><br>
6. To spread the news of the descent of the Divine Grace, with the help of self-realized disciples of Mātājī.<br>
14. To overcome the void between the material saturation and the unknown which is causing fear, restlessness, sleeplessness and tension leading to escapism from reality and false renunciation.<br>
