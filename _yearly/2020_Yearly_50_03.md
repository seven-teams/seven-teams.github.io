"But there should be a complete dedication in Sahaja Yoga.<br> When I say Sahaj Yog, you know that is the Yoga of your attention with My Feet. That's what it is. But if you are still moving with your egos, and if you are still thinking on those lines that, 'We are something and the we can start our own Sahaj Yog. We can work out this way and that way,' or 'My wife is like that, my child is like that, my husband is like that,' you have to give up all these problems on one side, otherwise you will not ascend.<br>
......<br>
Now the problems we have in the West, as you know, are stupid problems which are not suitable to any Sahaja Yogi.<br>
Attachment: first they were not attached to their wives or to their children, now they are attached like glue. I do not say you give up your children or your wife, but your attachment should be with Sahaj Yog. Once the blessings of Sahaja Yoga comes to you, they will flow to your children, to your wife, to everyone, to your country, to the whole world."<br>
