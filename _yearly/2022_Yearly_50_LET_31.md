"But if you stay in the center, that's the fourth side: is staying in the center. Turīya: is uhs ... sfourth ... fourth dimension. If you could stay on that, then you become a witness. And that's the point where you start sucking the joy of every moment. Every moment: of every doing, of every work, of every friendship, of every relationship, of every understanding.<br>
......<br>
So we have to give up our misidentifications with our previous styles of life, pre... previous types of living, previous type of executing any work. And we have to understand that we are not to plan. This house is built for Me. I'm the Power [laughing:] behind the whole universe, so, you don't have to plan. You just start off. 
......<br>
So, once you understand that we are not to worry about these things, which the people worry. We are not to worry about things which ... for which people just uh give their lives.<br>
We are here for joy! And joy will come to us, whatever it is! So we should seek joy, happiness, friendship.<br>
.......<br>
So the more you are in collectivity and in the blessing state, the better it could be always for you, in your other life, other thing also.<br>
......<br>
And so you all have to prepare yourself: talk about it. So there should be no more silence. There should be no more silence.<br>
......<br>
You must speak, you must talk about it. You must give Realization. Move your hands, move your leg. You have to walk across. For God's work, even if you have to beg you have to do that. This is God's work. Our has to do that, God's work, with all dedication, with all surrendering, and with all love and enjoyment."<br>

<b>Objectives:</b><br>
2. To achieve the evolution described in the foregoing para through the method of ``Sahaja Yoga" which means effortless, easy, relaxed method of meditation evolved by Mātājī. To organize meditation centers for this purpose. This completely precludes all the external human efforts like rituals, worships, prayers, recitations, reading, renunciation (i.e. saṃnyāsa), worship of the preceptor (Guru) or any other physical expressions.<br>
5. To introduce the only one internal living religion lying dead and camouflaged under external practices and precepts of religion in all the human beings and for this to organize tours and hold spiritual meetings as per wishes of Mātājī.<br>
22. To open, organize and run local centers of the Life Eternal Institution in various parts of India and in foreign countries, the centers being opened on the distinct understanding that meditation is the path of the entire human destiny, and that all barriers of states, nations and races are artificial and irrelevant to Life Eternal.<br>
