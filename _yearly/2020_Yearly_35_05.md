"Now My staying in uh England is completing its twelfth year. And that is the reason I wanted to talk to you people about Sahaja Yoga: how far it has gone, and where are we lacking.<br> 
The greatest thing that has happened is that we have established a religion: ...... Nirmala Dharma as we call it, the Vishwa Nirmala Dharma. And you know the meanings of the word: viśhwa means universal, nirmala means pure and dharma means religion.<br>
This has been established in America. And we have to register it here in England.<br>
Now, it is very important that, when we belong to a religion, we have to know what are the commandments of that religion is. And so far we have not drafted anything. It cannot be a thing made suitable to people or suitable to human beings, it cannot be. And it cannot compromise with your suitability."<br>
