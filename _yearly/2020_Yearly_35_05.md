"Now My staying in uh England is completing its twelfth year. And that is the reason I wanted to talk to you people about Sahaja Yoga: how far it has gone, and where are we lacking. 

The greatest thing that has happened is that we have established a religion: ...... Nirmala Dharma as we call it, the Vishwa Nirmala Dharma. And you know the meanings of the word: viśhwa means universal, nirmala means pure and dharma means religion. 

This has been established in America. And we have to register it here in England. 

Now, it is very important that, when we belong to a religion, we have to know what are the commandments of that religion is. And so far we have not drafted anything. It cannot be a thing made suitable to people or suitable to human beings, it cannot be. And it cannot compromise with your suitability."<br>
