"Man has not yet achieved that state where he can decide about his politics.<br>
......<br>
But today I have to warn a little bit, all of you, that in Sahaja Yoga, we have people who get into Realization, becoming angels, really. It's the boon by which you become angels, real angels. But angels should not fall. You must have heard about an angel called Lucifer who fell down and he became a Satan. And it's very dangerous for a Sahaja Yogi not to be a Sahaja Yogi after some time. He has to take a decision that, `I'm going to be a righteous person, a good person and a good Sahaja Yogi.' He cannot be a policeman and a thief, he cannot do it. You think of a policeman becoming a thief, what happens? He is punished doubly. It is just like that: a policeman cannot become a thief.<br>
In the same way, a Sahaja Yogi has to rise. If he does not, it's a very dangerous thing and I would warn you that you'll go out of circulation. You just get out of circulation from Sahaja Yoga, absolutely out of circulation."<br>
