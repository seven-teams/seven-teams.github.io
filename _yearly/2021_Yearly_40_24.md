"But a this shows that we should understand Sahaja Yoga, that unless and until we are quiet, unless and until we are in thoughtless awareness, we cannot grow. So, all these extreme behaviors cannot take you to the center.<br>
......<br>
But first you master yourself. If you have not mastered your body, your mind and emotions, how can you master? Master everything, you can master everything.<br>
......<br>
So, but if you are [a] master of everything, you can manage everything. Everything looks magical but it's not! Actually you're mastering.<br>
......<br>
But if you are the master you can play:  that's what is Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa is the Master. He has the mastery, you see. All the mastery He had. And that's how He managed things.<br>
......<br>
And actually in Sahaja Yoga nobody should be right-sided or left-sided. You are all in the center. You are all in the center. Because certain things like shoe-beating is such an embarrassing things, you know, but you have to [laughing:] do it, you can't help it if you have ego.<br>
......<br>
Just face yourself. `But this is me,' not others, not others, not others, yourself, face yourself. 'I'm like this? All right, I'll see to it. I'll put it right.' "<br>
