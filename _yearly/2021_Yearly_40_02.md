"And you must, not only take advantage of Sahaja Yoga in a material way but in a spiritual way, then only people will be surprised to see you, that you are si ... spiritually very different people: there's no force on you, uh there's no artificiality about it. It's all reality which you are feeling, and you are in reality. That will impress people.<br>
......<br>
Yeltsin is a ... horrible fellow. He is more sort of an ... American man, who wants to enjoy parties and, kna, women and this and that. Americans are very much impressed by him, very much.<br>
The more stupid you are the better it is there [in America].<br>
Like this Elizabeth's honeymoon. [Everyone laughs.] I mean, Australians will never do that. I mean, you are very much matured, compared [to Americans]. Such stupid people, I tell you! And America is full of them. I don't know, how to ... bring sense to their heads.<br>
First it's a ... newly born country. And so much of abundance. So very bumptious. They are good at technology and all that, they have done well, to their hands. But maturity is missing. And also compassion, I think.<br>
......<br>
Is predicted that sixty five percent of Americans will be... become schizophrenic, imagine. You dare not go there! [Laughs.]<br>
This schizophrenia I don't know from where it comes.<br>
......<br>
But now we have some very good Americans, who are Sahaja Yogis, I must say. Grégoire is sometimes exhausted but, he thinks that some good things are coming now. Black people there are good but the best are Chinese. Now we have more Chinese than Americans in Sahaja Yoga.<br>
......<br>
And now that every day I am in Italy, every week there is some sort of a[n] exposure of this Vatican come[s]. Horrible they are!"<br>
