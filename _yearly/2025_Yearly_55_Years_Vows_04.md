</p>

<p>
"Now I have found out: that Western people waste so much of their energy in decision-making. And what are the decisions you have made, so far? Like, What food should we have?'<br>
'What does it become ultimately, all the food that you decide to eat?' Same about our lives. 'When we think and try to plan our lives, what do we make out of it? What is the ultimate result of our life?', we should think.<br>
Because of this ego orientation, this decision-making is there. I'm amazed: how this decision-making about food has started!<br>
......<br>
Please take decision-making at zero. Say, 'I do not take any decision. I will not take any decision. Let Mother take the decision.' This is the way you can do it.<br>
Now, everywhere Sahaja Yoga is coming up, people are understanding, you have to discipline yourself! There is no idea of discipline! You try to disciplining others and nothing about yourself.<br>
Other ... everything that is living is disciplined. See on a tree how the leaves spread, how they discipline themselves and how they arrange themselves. Is there any fight going on?<br>
First of all, decision-making about food should be zero.<br>
Please stop all the meetings, I think that is also another ego trips going on. All the ego trips, meetings, what do you achieve? This. Better not have any more meetings.<br>
You better all sit down and quietly meditate within yourself. And work it out, properly. Your vibrations should be all right, that's the main point is.<br>
......<br>
Now, another thing I have to tell you is this: that, I was thinking that if you people feel all right, your vibrations are all right, if you are settled down, if you really become gurus -- guru means dignity, humility, meekness, understanding, lovable nature, all these things must be developed in you. You cannot suddenly become like that -- and [in] that case, you should decide to go to various places or in England and also outside. Uh-uh-uh ... I have arranged for that."<br>
