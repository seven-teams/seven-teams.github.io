"So, Sahaja Yoga today is the thing which proves what has been said so far. It proves.<br>
Is not just a cock and bull story. Because people do not believe into all these things. They think that, 'It's all cock and bull story. Who was Christ? Who was Kṛiṣhṇa? Who was Rādhā? After all, there was no God.'<br>
......<br>
Now, Viśhuddhi chakra is ... cr... was created on the Satury [Saturn]. So, it is the Saturn: that's the important star of the Viśhuddhi chakra. So whenever the Saturn is at the highest, America will be in a better place to do things. But I don't think they at ... know much about themselves. They don't know what they are, why they are on this Earth, what is their work, what they are supposed to do, or what is the purpose of God of creating America.<br>
......<br>
About sixty years back, I think about the time of My birth only, the negativity started taking a new form: in understanding the Western confusion. They are all Western in this, if you see them. And the Western confusion they took over for their own advantages: they used it for their own advantages. And this is where the Western people have failed to make them out.<br>
......<br>
So the task of Sahaja Yoga is to establish the Truth within yourself. It is not that we can have a membership. We cannot have a person enroll into it, we cannot call them as uh-uh-uh branded Sahaja Yogis: is the growth of the person that is to be seen.<br>
Now there are so many lectures which I have given about Ṛitaṃbharā Pragñyā and all these things, and I think for every Sahaja Yogi it is necessary to listen to those lectures, go through it, understand them and to meditate so that you grow.<br>
Because it is not a plastic thing that we can create. It's a living process of the living uhr uh energy of the Living God. And so, it has to grow within you. By thinking you cannot make it grow, but by not thinking you allow it to grow more and more.<br>
......<br>
And He has great qualities, and one of the greatest qualities He has that: He has a Saṃhāra Śhakti, by which He can kill the demons. And all those demons who are settled down here, are really mistaken. Because, if this is [laughing:] the place of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, they are very dangerously placed. Because once He is awakened here, they all will be completely finished through His Sudarśhan Chakra which He has in His hand, and He can just kill them one by one.<br>
But first He's to be pleased, and He's to be awakened, He has to be prasanna. That's the word. Prasanna means to be pleased. And then, it works out."<br>
