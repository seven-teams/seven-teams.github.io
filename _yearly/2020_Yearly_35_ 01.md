"Of course, Sahaja Yoga is the religion, no doubt, is the Universal Religion. Is a religion that integrates all the religion[s], brings all the Principles of Religions together and shows the ... shows the oneness.<br>
...... you'll be all called as Nirmalites. Means: the one who have been enlightened by Nirmalā. ...... So, this is Nirmalites, means the ones who are being enlightened by Nirmalā.<br>
So, if you like the name, we can call it: Universal Nirmala Religion. If that suits your people in the West, I think that's a good name. So we have now proclaimed and pronounced that this is a religion, which is a Pure Universal Religion. When you say Universal Nirmala means Pure or Immaculate Religion. And I hope you are agreeable to that."<br>
