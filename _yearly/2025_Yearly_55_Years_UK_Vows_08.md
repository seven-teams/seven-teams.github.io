"But I do not know if I should tell you about Hell and frighten you, or I should put restrictions on you, but this is the one, Mahāvīra's Pūjā, I have been avoiding, so far.<br>
......<br>
Now, in Sahaja Yoga, is the other way round: it's all enjoyment. You enjoy everything: you enjoy each other's company, you enjoy music, kuh. There's all enjoyment for you. But without touching your inner enjoyment, you cannot ... you cannot ascend. You must touch your eh inner enjoyment and then enjoy everything else.<br> 
......<br>
Now, as you have got Realization, I'm sure, you won't go to that extreme. But still, you must learn to have self-discipline. If you have no self-discipline, you cannot jump into that depth, where there's complete Keval[a]gyān, means: Absolute Knowledge, Absolute Love and Absolute Joy.<br>
So, the self-disciplining is very important. Of course, you need not go to the Mahāvīra's extent now, because-ss, luckily, I have given you Realization, but still, do not go back to things which you have left.<br>
......<br>
So unless and until you touch your depth, you'll become like any other religion, because you won't be actually Sahaja Yogis, just nominal.<br>
So we have to work in such a manner, that: we understand ourselves and we understand our attention and we try to ascend. I don't have to tell you: you yourself have to work it out in such a manner that you touch your depth and you become an ascetic within yourself. Then only you will be really uh doing the divine work properly, with proper understanding.<br>
Sahaja Yoga is the integration of all these Great Prophets and these Incarnations. So, I have to tell you that, whatever were your conditionings and all that, to get rid of them, you must get out of this Ocean of Illusion."<br>

"But, when I tell you this thing, you must understand, that: whatever is good for you, whatever is your temperament, whatever is [your] aptitude, you have to take something that will nourish that, that will improve you and give you a balance."<br>
