</p>

<p>
"Today, specially, I have to speak to people who feel weak to follow Sahaja Yoga, who are fickle minded, those who lack strength, those who are afraid of taking Sahaja Yoga seriously.<br>
......<br> 
Sloth is the curse of this country I feel. Is the curse of the Sahaja Yoga also. I do not know if it is the curse of the Western World, but sloth is something: is like a devil that can keep you very much glued to your own positions and will not allow you to move out.<br>
......<br>
Mediation is very important after Sahaja Yoga. You have slept and slept all your life, sleeping is not so important. You have to today promise Me that, from tomorrow, you all are going to get up in the morning and meditate.<br>
......<br>
If you have to be a first class Sahaja Yogi, you have to put your attention to it.<br>
......<br>
If you want Sahaja Yoga to work out in this country and in the West, we have to understand our own value.<br>
......<br>
Do you know that Sahaja Yoga is the only way? Is the only method that Divine Grace has given you, by which you are going to transform the whole world. And lazy lumps, how can they help Sahaja Yoga?<br>
......<br>
The another thing which goes against Sahaja Yoga is, I have told you hundred times, I don't know how many times: is to talk ill about other Sahaja Yogis!<br>
......<br>
So nobody should identify with your temperament. That is very important for Sahaja Yoga.<br>
......<br>
So, it is you: you are the reflection of Sahaja Yoga, not Me.<br>
......<br>
So, for sac... Sahaja Yoga['s] sake we have to sacrifice certain things and I have told you already that we have to sacrifice all the funny habits or temperaments we have got.<br>
......<br>
So, everybody must decide that, `I am moving backwards, I must move forwards.' By that you are helping the whole growth, and will be the ideal thing for Sahaja Yoga. So your individual growth should be all right, and your collective growth should be all right. It takes not much: meditation you have to do. You have to sit in Nirvichāra, you have to give up your thinking. Try to be in Nirvichār, try to be in Nirvichār, and you will be surprised how the thing will flower out.<br>
......<br>
So, one has to take a very, very pragmatic attitude towards Sahaja Yoga, and Sahaja Yoga related to ourselves.<br>
......<br>
But I have to tell you that this time I am giving you the discipline of Sahaja Yoga. Discipline yourself. Discipline is very important. If you do not discipline yourself, any tree which is not disciplined cannot grow properly. You have to discipline yourself. If you do not want to discipline, only thing you'll be coming to My program and will be of no use to Me. You have to develop your depth, you have to go deeper into it and it has to be worked out.<br>
......<br>
You have to learn Sahaja Yoga, you have to know, you have to be experts.<br>
......<br>
Timidness has no value in Sahaja Yoga."<br>
