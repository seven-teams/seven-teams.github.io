"Do you know, in London, who rules? Saint George! How [laughing:] dare anybody touch them‽ Saint George rules there. So, we don't need a [laughing:] tiger. It's all right, He's already there, settled down."<br>

"It's said that, "At Sahasrāra, the Goddess incarnates as Mahāmāyā." Because the job She has to do is of a very different nature.<br>
At the Heart chakra, Anāhata, She has to just defend, just defend, the seekers from the clutches of the evil forces, which are also not so subtle. They are ... uh very gross ... like ... forms, human forms. And it's easy to fight and have a war with them, kill them.<br>
But at the point of Sahasrāra, the work is very complicated. First of all, the Sahasrāra of the human beings is itself a very complicated thing.<br>
......<br>
As it is this Mahāmāyā, no one can understand. Even Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, Maheśha could not understand, is so tremendous. It has played tricks on Them also! <br>
......<br>
Another point about Mahāmāyā is: you being the Mahāmāyā, you are not afraid.<br>
Supposing, Chaṇḍī has to stand here with Her sword in Her hand, nobody would dare go near Her.<br>
But despite that you people shake sometimes, I don't know why!"<br>
