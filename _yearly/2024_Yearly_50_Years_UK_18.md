"Sahaja Yoga is very simple made easy, absolutely made easy. But still, we'll trust ourselves more -- isn't it? -- than the Divine. That's what everybody else does, but for [a] Sahaja Yogi it is important that: 'Leave it to Me.' I know how to manage. I know how to punish, and also I know how to save, and I know how to love. So leave it to Me.<br>
......<br>
So, first of all, collectivity has to be developed.<br>
......<br>
If you have to grow in Sahaj ... grow in Sahaja Yoga, first thing is: we must grow in collectivity.<br>
......<br>
So, today I say: that, 'Let us open our heart. Just like the flowers, we have to come up the tree. Let us compete in giving more, being nice to others, instead of criticizing.'<br>
......<br>
What is important it's: 'How you deal with each other and enjoy each other. How much capacity you have got to enjoy each other.'<br>
And that's the way you really transform yourself into a beautiful joyous personality, and others too."<br>
