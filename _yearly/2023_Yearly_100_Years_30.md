[Walking to sit down but turning around:] Normally I don't tell about Myself -- but today he exposed Me as soon as I came, I had to tell -- because is not tactful. Is not tactful to say anything.<br>
I, it's better that you discover Me than I tell you, because Christ was crucified, everybody was tortured. I do not want to hamper My work. Because it makes no difference by telling you anything before Realization. Is better to tell you after Realization that I am the Holy Ghost, no doubt. I am the One about which Christ has talked.<br>
I have told them, I had never said this on .. from a ...<br>
<b>Lady:</b> Platform.<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> ... platform.<br>
And I told ... they, they have been telling Me: ``Mother, You must say that once." I said, ``In America I'll declare [it]."<br>
So, ah today I declare that I am the Holy Ghost, I am the Holy Spirit, who has incarnated on this Earth for your Realization.<br>
May God bless you."<br>
