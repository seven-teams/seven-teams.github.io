"Of course, the bhakti does give that purity, but if there is anything lingering in your mind, I have to tell you that there are three things that are going to happen from today.<br>
First, we have started Vishwa Nirmala Dharma. You are under the vision of Śhrī Gaṇeśh, under the guidance of your Spirit, and under the blessings of God Almighty. But be careful, because once you become that, you have to keep to that Dharma, you have to be honest about it. If you are dishonest from today onwards, you be careful, anything can happen to you if you get out of the maryādās. Till you keep to the Maryādās of Sahaja Yoga, saying morning, evening, night that, 'I am a Sahaja Yogi,' nobody can har ... hurt, nobody can trouble you. On the contrary you will be enjoying life if you keep to the maryādās. But if you leave the Maryādās of Sahaja Yoga, you will have big problems.<br>
So this is the second thing I want to tell you: that today we have started the Great Religion, which was promised long time back, of realized Souls.<br>
Now the third thing is that with all these things we are doing, we must promise to God also that, 'We will know about Sahaja Yoga through proper understanding, reading every word of it, we'll master the knowledge of Sahaj Yog, we'll keep ourselves clean, and completely surrender our lives to Sahaja Yoga.' This is what you have to promise in your heart. Surrendering to Sahaja Yoga is actually surrendering to joy, bliss and peace. In that you are the gainer, nobody is a loser in it. This is how today we have to decide once for all."<br>
