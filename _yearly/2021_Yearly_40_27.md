"So today first we have Gaṇeśh Pūjā because Gaṇeśha is innocence and we have to establish Him in any place where is, want to start our work or do anything about it, because He is innocence and innocence was created before everything else was created. Is the Most Powerful Power, I should say, Innocence.<br>
And then we'll do the Guru Pūjā which is actually the Ādi Guru, the Primordial Master, who incarnated on this Earth many a times and, as you know, as Dattātreya He was born, as Janaka, Nāṇaka and many others. That principle is within us and that is very important that we should develop the Principle of Guru Nāṇak or Janak or any one of these Primordial Masters within. Because if the Spirit is the Master, we have to become the master of ourselves. And the Power of the Masters are that They are essences of the innocence of the Creator, of the Sustainer and the Destroyer. They are the innocence of all these. Out of Them, this Great Personality, innocence of these three personalities, was created this Great Incarnation.<br>

The most difficult, I find, is America. It's like Mathura where Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa had to go and establish Himself, that was the [laughs] Kingdom of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa and where Kaṃsa was ruling. So, the people in Mathura were the most difficult people because they were governed by devils, and the devils have a capacity to dominate good people. They're all so dominated that even where Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa lived, they tried to go and harm Him and kill Him and all that. And all the dynamism of these people from Mathura was killed by Śh... Kaṃsa who was to be killed by Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br>
......<br>
That is what is My job here, is to raise the mountain I think and raise it on My fingertip like that. But this finger has to be strong and this finger is nothing but the Sahaja Yogis of America and they have to help by their dynamic behavior and by their proper understanding, responsibility as the people belonging to this great nation of Fatherhood. This is the finger of the Father and that fatherhood has to be dynamic, has to be overpowering and has to be very responsible. And in that responsibility you learn so many things -- so that's My job is, that's My goal is. She [anchor] asked Me in the TV [in Los Angeles], "What is Your goal, Mother?" I didn't tell her that I have to raise the mountain on My finger, you see, she would never have understood that. But that is what one has to do here: to raise the mountain. And I find it's like that only -- mountainous."<br>
