"Now be confident that you have powers. And this is the new change that is going to come within your own understanding.<br>
So far only you knew that you could feel the vibrations, that you could cure people -- you could help to cure, I mean still not so confident -- that ... uh ... you could feel the Paramachaitanya.<br>
But you did not know what Dynamic Forces are working in you now. And this is the new change that is going to come.<br>
With this new change, you have to assume a new character. And the new character is announcement.<br>
So far I had told you not to talk about Sahaja Yoga very openly, blatantly, but now the time has come. We waited long for these days. Now you have to all start talking about it, announcing about it and telling about it to everyone. Otherwise, the world would say that, 'We never knew about it.'<br>
......<br>
You have to understand that all these powers are bubbling in you. And just out of formality or maybe out of shyness or maybe little cowardice, you are hiding them.<br>
......<br>
So now you are in the Royal Court: take up your responsibilities. Everybody has to feel responsible. And assume what you are.<br>
......<br>
This is the New Era we are starting from today. And this is the day I was waiting for all of you to realize that you are not Sahaja Yogis for only your selfish ends, nor for your families, nor for your communities, nor for your country, but for the whole world. Expand yourself. You must have that vision before you -- that I have put many a times before you people -- that you have to emancipate the humanity.<br>
......<br>
Today we have here people from all over the world, and you go and tell this message to all the rest of the people, whom I have not met, that, 'Mother has already announced, through the Viṣhṇumāyā also [smiles], that you all have become now Mahāyogis.' 
......<br>
Now, for you, it is important to see that you have something so unique with you. But only thing what you need is a courage and a complete commitment to go forward with this propagation of Sahaja Yoga, announcement of Sahaja Yoga."<br>
