<p>
"If Sahaja Yoga can be carried for ten centuries, this world will be a different place.<br>
......<br>
We are committed to Sahaja Yoga! If there are even five people who are really, fully committed to Sahaja Yoga, it can be built up that way.<br>
......<br>
And when this commitment will start, I'm sure Sahaja Yoga will spread like anything.<br>
......<br>
And this has to come from, first from the leaders and then from others: complete commitment to Sahaja Yoga.<br>
......<br>
One has to decide the commitment: `I have committed to Sahaja Yoga.' And that is what you have to be committed [to]."<br>
