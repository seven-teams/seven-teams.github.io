</p>

<p>
"So now, for you, it is a great responsibility as Sahaja Yogis, first to love your wife. That's very important.<br>
......<br>
So you have to understand. You have to understand your wife, what she wants. You have to understand why she is not happy. Look after her. Look after her need. And look after everything that is so important for her.<br>
......<br>
All of you have taken a very right decision to marry in Sahaja Yoga, and a Sahaja Yogi, which is a very stable thinking, I feel, that you can have a very beautiful married life and a very stable married life.<br>
......<br>
In Sahaja Yoga, no one has to suffer, has to tolerate, has to bear any insults.<br>
......<br>
But your relationship is such as it is of one personality. He should look after you, you should look after him. All the time you should be worried about him, and he should be worried about you.<br>
I'm sure if you really develop this attitude, there will be no problem for you.<br>
......<br>
So try to understand how important you are to Sahaja Yoga. And what a world you have to create: as a wife, as a mother, and as a sister to all your brothers."<br>
