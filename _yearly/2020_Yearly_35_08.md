"Then, "I am on this Earth now, this life is for the work of God. And for that I have to be a pure person, because I belong to Vishwa Nirmal Dharm. I have to be pure. I have to achieve my purity: through meditation, through every way, watching myself, `I have to be a pure person.' And if I am a Sahaja Yogi, if I am united with that All-pervading Power of Love, I should be the medium to give that love to others, and compassion. I have no time for other things. Other things are of no value. My attention has to be pure. My life has to be pure."<br>
......<br>
So Buddha has said: "Buddham śharaṇaṃ gacchāmi." "I bow to all those who are realized Souls." "Dhammam śharaṇaṃ gacchāmi." "I bow myself, to my dharma," that is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma. And then lastly is: "Saṅghaṃ śharaṇaṃ gacchāmi." "I bow to collectivity."<br<
......<br>
Then the "Dhammam śharaṇaṃ gacchāmi" is very important. What have you done for Vishwa Nirmala Dharma? [Silence for 11 seconds.] Whatever [is] needed for the work of Vishwa Nirmala Dharma, whether it is money, whether it is your house, any possession. Whether it is labor: any kind of labor."<br>
