</p>

<p>
"Now, uh first thing you have to do is to accept the Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.<br> 
This is the religion which is a Universal Religion, which encompasses all the religion[s], respects all the Great Incarnations, knows about Them and all the good things that are told in all the religions it accepts. It's uh One Religion which is not outside.<br> 
Outside religions have created problems you know, they just create differences div... and divise [divide] people, is divisiveness, divides people.<br>  
But this is One Religion. But this One Religion was there amongst Sufis, amongst all the Saints. All those people who were born realized Souls, they had the same religion, and that religion of humanity we follow. This religion is not outside, it is inside. It's inside, in the yourself, is awakened, and here we respect all the Great Incarnations. All the great religions we respect, not only that [but] we follow [them], but we do not believe in any differentiation or superiority.<br> 
So the first you have to accept that you belong to this religion. Then there won't be any fights about small things, like, 'I belong to this caste, this community, this religion, this uh country,' nothing. You are beyond that. And that's what we have to establish if we want to have real peace and joy and blessings of the Divine. So, this is the first thing that we have to do: is to accept."<br>
