"Today, we are celebrating the Resurrection of Chr... Christ. That is the greatest message of Christ['s] life, not the crucifixion. Anybody can be crucified and killed, but this dead body of Christ was resurrected from death. Death itself died and He overcome in [overcame it].<br> 

It's a miracle for ordinary human beings, definitely, but not for Christ because He was a Divine Person. He was Śhrī Gaṇeśha, He was Auṃkāra Itself. So, He could walk on the water, gravity would not affect Him, and also He got resurrected because death could not affect Him. Such a Great Divine Personality, specially created for human beings that people should recognize Him.<br> 

But they did not recognize Him, they killed Him in a very brutal manner. And even now, they think cross is a great thing because Christ died on a cross. Is a very cruel idea of human beings to respect the cross. What does it show? It shows that people liked all the cruelties done to Him, symbolizing cross as the one that represented His death and His atrocities, the way He was tortured.<br>

So, it was a very sad time when He was crucified. But when He got resurrected it was the most joyous, most auspicious and most beautiful time."<br>
