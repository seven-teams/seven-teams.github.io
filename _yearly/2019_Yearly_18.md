<font size="+2"><b>Togliatti Is A Special Place And Russia Is The Highest</b><br></font>
</p>

<p>
"Togliatti is a special place. Uh so many members we have. Uh I think, I do not know if there are more than [in] Moscow or not, but they are such a lot for this place. Is very surprising [laughs]. [Laughs again.] Very uh surprising thing because people are working in a motor company and the living with such people and then you find them so spiritually strong.<br>
<br>
Yuri Vasiliev [translates the mayor]: Uh why it is happening Śhrī Mātājī? What is Your opinion?<br>
<br>
<font color="Red"><b>Śhrī Mātājī: </b></font>Is something, I think the Volga River's mh uh meeting the sea or whatever it is, it's a very uh holy auspicious place.<br>
......<br>
Yuri Vasiliev [translates the mayor]: You may correct me later is [if] I am wrong. Uh because it is a very new town, very new city. In fact it is several years ago it was eleven thousands [11,000] of citizens only. But now it's seven hundred [thousand] people, Śhrī Mātājī. So, these people love this place, this town, or city now, is very much, Śhrī Mātājī.<br>
<br>
<font color="Red"><b>Śhrī Mātājī: </b></font>Yeah.<br>
<br>
Yuri Vasiliev [translates the mayor]: It may be, maybe, from ... from the love of this.<br>
<br>
<font color="Red"><b>Śhrī Mātājī: </b></font>In the whole of Russia ...<br>
<br>
Yuri Vasiliev: Yes.<br>
<br>
<font color="Red"><b>Śhrī Mātājī: </b></font>In the whole of Russia, uh uh I must say that -- of course Indians know what it is and all that, so we forget India -- but the highest are in Russia. In the whole world now there are sixty-five nations I've [I am] working, Russia is the highest.<br>
<br>
Yuri Vasiliev [translates the mayor]: I believe it's a basically roots of, in spirituality of Russian people prima.<br>
<br>
<font color="Red"><b>Śhrī Mātājī: </b></font>They are very introspective by nature. They are very introspective. I have seen your writers and poets are all very introspective. And the clean heart, clean hearted. Simple hearted. They don't take to false people.<br> 
<br>
S... see, like in America they always take to false things. All gurus who went there were all false people, made lots of money. When I went there first time they asked Me ah how many Rolls-Royces I had. [Laughs.] I said, "I have none. I've only one car and that also belongs to My husband." So, there I [they] said, "Then You are not in the business?" I said, "No, there's no business." [Laughs.] So they were not interested in Me."<br>
