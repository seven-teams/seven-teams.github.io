<font size="+2"><b>Certain Things We Must Understand In Sahaja Yoga</b><br></font>
</p>

<p>
"There are certain things we must understand in Sahaja Yoga.<br>
First point: there is no fundamentalism in Sahaja Yoga. Nobody should use My words or say, 'Mother said so,' nobody should. That is how all this hierarchies have been built, in the churches everywhere. Everybody can read, every can do it you can find out. There is no way of controlling people by saying: 'Mother said so.' That shows that you are trying to use My words to tell people off. You are not in charge.<br>
......<br>
So it's a journey: journey of Sahaja Yoga to our destination. The destination is that we have to emancipate maximum number of human beings into Sahaja Yoga.<br> 
......<br>
So, first of all we must know it's a living process. You cannot put on it artificial types of things, aah which will curb the growth of Sahaja Yoga. Is very important to understand. There where I find that people don't understand Sahaj Yog. You cannot mold into any pattern. It molds by itself. Works by itself.<br>
......<br>
What I'm telling you, is that: if you try to accept all these outdated ideas in Sahaja Yoga, you'll go down, you'll rot. No use coming to Sahaj Yog. We are fresh, we are new and we are living. We don't accept these kind of ideas about m-men or women.<br> 
......<br>
You are a Sahaja Yogi. So your house is Mine, you are Mine, everything is Mine. What is there to come to your house?<br>
......<br>
Now in Sahaja Yoga, we should know that nothing is salable. Whatever we have and own, we'll keep it with ourself or give it to our children or give it as presents to others. You are not going to sell anything. ...... So, we must change our mind and say that: 'Whatever we own, we are not going to sell it.' "<br>
