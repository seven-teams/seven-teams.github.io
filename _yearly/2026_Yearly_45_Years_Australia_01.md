"I think this is a very important occasion. Is important because ... Sadāśhiva, the God Almighty, who is One, is expressed on your heart as Spirit, the Śhiva.<br>
......<br>
Now you know Australia was full of racialism once upon a time: nobody was come ... allowed to come in here. Might be fifty years back or so. But today, in Australia, what a change it is!<br>
......<br>
I bless you all from My heart, where resides the Śhiva, the Sadāśhiva. And Sadāśhiva blesses you..<br>
......<br>
And look after your vibrations, which pulsates [pulsate] in your being, because the Spirit has awakened in your attention, in your central nervous system. That's the most important thing you have to do, the rest of it is sahaj. [The] rest of it is absolutely sahaj."<br>
