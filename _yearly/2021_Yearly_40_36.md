</p>

<p>
"But this seeking is within yourself. The seeking has to happen within as a living process of the living force of God's Love.<br>
We should understand what is living is. Living is that which we cannot do ourselves. Like we cannot transform a flower into a fruit.<br>
......<br>
Under these circumstances a person starts seeking. And when he starts seeking, he starts seeking in through his uh ... two forces, which I told you, the left and the right side, which are called as Ha and Ṭha nāḍīs in the Sanskrit language, or they are called as the Sun and the Moon nāḍī, or Piṅgalā and Iḍā nāḍī.<br>
......<br>
So, in Sahaja Yoga, as we call it, we have to have a very-very open mind. We have to keep an absolutely open mind. And this open mind, like a scientist, has to see for yourself, actually, what reality is. And should not just believe into one person or one type of idea or another type of idea.<br>
......<br>
So, under proper understanding, one has to know that: `We have to see the Truth as it is!' We cannot make the Truth. Truth is, what it is and it will remain what it is. So, we have to just keep ourself open, absolutely open, to see what Truth is.<br>
......<br>
So the ego also generates a necessity for getting into habits which are anti-body, uh which are anti our life, anti our uh ... anti-God, I should say, anti our ascent. And that's what happens to us when we become very much ego-oriented.<br>
......<br>
So to become the I, to become the Spirit, is the most important thing."<br>
