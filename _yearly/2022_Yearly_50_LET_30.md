"You can see from His poems that He was absolutely authoritative. He knew the authority, He had the authority. He talked like a man with complete authority. He had no doubt even. He has no doubts. He just said, ``This is going to happen!"<br>
And, like a great warrior, that He knew ... He knew that one has to fight the negativity, one has to fight all these dark problems.<br>
The Spirit has to fight all the time the matter.<br>
And that's how He talked, spoke, wrote, [as] a warrior would do, because He started the fight when He was born here, hundred years back."

"Among comes to the Realization, that forgiveness is the most powerful way of cleansing the spiritual being.<br>
......<br>
When I read Him, I am amazed at His s-s-sense of humor: how He openly comes out with such remarks. I feel He is like Mārkaṇḍeya in India, or Kabīr Dās in India, who slashed the whole society with their sword all the time to see that they are brought to the proper shape, without fear. But so gentle. If you read the song of the `[Book of] Thel' [by Śhrī William Blake], is so gentle.<br>
And all of them, who were Him perhaps or are of the same style, [were] extremely open, straightforward, you can say even blatant and extremely gentle."<br>

<b>Objectives:</b><br>
1. To expedite the process of spiritual evolution by exciting the residual consciousness i.e. Kuṇḍalinī, to rise ultimately leading to Self-realization (Second Birth as defined in the Bible, the Koran, the Indian Scriptures and the great ancient Prophets and Sages all over the world).<br>
5. To introduce the only one internal living religion lying dead and camouflaged under external practices and precepts of religion in all the human beings and for this to organize tours and hold spiritual meetings as per wishes of Mātājī.<br>
13. To employ the energy of love to overcome hatred that is the cause of wars, disintegration and destruction by publishing and relating the spiritual experiences of Sadhakas which prove the universal laws of love.<br>
