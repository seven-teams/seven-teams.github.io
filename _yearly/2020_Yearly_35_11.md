"In every birthday, we make a new resolution. Now I understand that I should also make a new resolution. And the new resolution is that the Vishwa Dharma  that we've made and established and we all follow if anyone doesn't follow its maryādā, such a person should not have a right to be called a Sahaja Yogi. This is what I thought we should all resolve. Anyone who follows its maryādā, only he can be its follower. Any follower of Vishwa Dharma, who doesn't live by it, then we can't accept him as a Sahaja Yogi. For example, if a person takes dowry, believes in the caste system, class system, then he can't be a Sahaja Yogi.<br>
So I have decided today that anyone who calls themselves a Sahaja Yogi, they should not just have a complete understanding of Vishwa Dharma but if it doesn't reflect in their behavior, then they have no right to be in Sahaja Yoga. They should be told that they should atone for their mistakes and correct themselves as part of their atonement before they come back to Sahaja Yoga.<br>
There is no problem if people say, 'We, fewer people are left.' There isn't a lot of space left in God's Kingdom.<br>
......<br>
Tell your neighbors about it and say that, 'We believe in Universal Religion and not in any other religion.' If Yogis don't say that, then we can't accept them as Yogis. Sahaja Yoga is not for people who are scared to tell people in their society that they are followers of Vishwa Nirmala Dharma or those who are scared to tell others that they are Sahaja Yogis. You will have to fully follow the Maryādā of Sahaja Yoga.<br>
Some people tell Me that, "Mother, we sometimes drink a little alcohol, smoke a little, consume tobacco," then you are not a Sahaja Yogi. If a person doesn't follow the Maryādā of Sahaja Yoga, then he can not follow a Universal Religion.<br>
And this Universal Religion of ours, we must keep completely pure as it's not just a Universal Religion, but Vishwa Nirmala Dharma. We can't allow any impurity to creep in, that's why anyone impure, can't come into it. Only those people who have fully accepted this Universal Religion and ensure that their behavior is within the maryādā can stay in it.<br>
This is the resolution I have made for My Birthday and I hope you will accept it with love."<br>
