</p>

<p>
"Is important to understand that's marriage is a very important thing in Sahaja Yoga. Because the basis of society is a family. And our society should have very good families. That's why we are paying so much attention to these weddings, that they should make good families.<br>
......
Is not a mental thing to get married, is not an emotional thing to get married: in Sahaja Yoga it is spiritual. <br>
......<br>
But you see today you are excited and tomorrow you find you are fallen on the street! Can't understand, like a drama! It's reality, is real life where you have to see what marriage means: good for your children, good for progeny, good for our society of Sahaja Yoga.<br>
......<br>
So from many angles we have to understand that marriage is a very pivotal thing for Sahaja Yoga.<br>"
