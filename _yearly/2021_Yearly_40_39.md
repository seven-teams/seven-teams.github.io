<p>
"Now we have formed the Dharma, Vishwa Dharma. But it must have a culture.<br>
......<br>
When you establish a religion like this, Vishwa Dharma, is not like any other religion. Is the Real Religion within us.<br>
And this reality comes to us because now we are one with the Spirit.<br>
So when we talk of Sahaj Culture, it is the Culture of the Spirit.<br>
Now what is a culture? First of all let us see what is a culture is. So the culture is the pattern of behavior we have with others. Is a common pattern of behavior we are supposed to have with others.<br>
......<br>
So the's ... Culture of the Spirit doesn't change. Is universal, and is higher than any other culture. Apart from that, it integrates all the essences of all the cultures.<br>
So, it emanates from the Spirit.<br>
......<br>
So, in the Culture of Sahaj, because the Spirit is the dignity, is the majesty, is the glory of God, you have to judge yourself! `Did I say something which is not respecting my Spirit? Did I do something that is not glorious?'<br>
......<br>
In the Culture of Sahaj, you have to become an expert: expertise. Expertise comes through your adherence to your Mother. Expertise: you all should be an expert. And who will give you the certificate? Is your Mother only. Who else? I may not say so, but your Spirit will say that, and not your ego."<br>
