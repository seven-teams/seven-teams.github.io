"But ah this shows that we should understand Sahaja Yoga, that unless and until we are quiet, unless and until we are in thoughtless awareness, we cannot grow. So, all these extreme behaviors cannot take you to the center.<br>
......<br>
But, you see, marriage is a uh-uh-uh thing for Indians, is that is uh-uh, just like having a baby in the house, you see, just like that. It's a part and parcel. So, they never think that, 'All right, my wife has come, she's short or she's uh fair or dark,' nothing, 'Now she's my wife.' Like your child. Like your child comes in, that's it. So, the ... this is what it is a marriage: this is a wife who has come, the husband is there. Husband is supposed to be a husband, wife is supposed to be a wife, finished. That's a part of the family, we all live together. And the-uh husband is supposed to protect the wife, and the wife is supposed to look after the husband and all the family people and everyone.<br>
......<br>
Is a, once you're married, just accept this is the part of your life, is from your destiny, it's your life ... uh previous lives' things, is just accept the fact. Work it out.<br>
And we don't even work out marriages, they just work out.<br>
......<br>
But, you see, in Sahaja Yoga you become actually the person who is a Vaiṣhṇava, is the one who is in the center. Viṣhṇu's Path: you are neither left nor right. You're on Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's Path.<br>
So, how can you remain left or right? If you are left or right then you are no more Sahaj Yog.<br>
......<br>
And actually in Sahaja Yoga nobody should be right-sided or left-sided. You are all in the center. You are all in the center. Because certain things like shoe-beating is such an embarrassing things, you know, but you have to [laughing:] do it, you can't help it if you have ego.<br>
......<br>
So, tomorrow I'm going to talk about the Master of Masters [Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa], whom I can master also. I can master that Master also. All right?"<br>
