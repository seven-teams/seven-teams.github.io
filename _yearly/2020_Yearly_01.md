"And there what happened? Bethlehem He was born, near Jerusalem, but there what happened? As you know the three kings came from far off. Nobody knew about His birth in the surroundings, say in Jerusalem area or Bethlehem area. Nobody bothered. But from very far off, three great kings came to see Him. Is very symbolic that to the people who were nearer, closer to Him, it was nothing. They were so gross, they had no sensitivity. And from miles away, they started walking, coming on the camel, sometimes resting in the night. Days in and days out they traveled with the help of the star and came to that little abode which was in Bethlehem.<br>
In a small little place to arrive with that humility, how sensitive they must be! They forgot their position in life, they forgot their own wealth and all those things they have been enjoying. To them it was the greatest thing, the greatest pilgrimage to go all the way to see the little child who was not talking, He was not doing anything. They felt it's a privilege to honor Him, just to honor Him, just to pay Him honor. What was the need? The little child would not even recognize. He did! That's a different point. But just to pay the honor, they must have gone through very great difficulties to go down to Bethlehem. It was not a city, it was a village, where there was no place for them to rest. God knows where they stayed. There had no hotels like this in those days. God knows where they stayed. They dressed up very well because they have to see the King of Kings.<br>
......<br>
Sahaja Yoga is meant for people who have a very large heart where [laughing:] Christ could be adorned. He's to be restored upon that great heart of yours. In every way one has to enlarge the heart."<br>
