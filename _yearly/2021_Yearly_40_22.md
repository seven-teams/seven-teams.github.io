"And the Mother Earth gives you the creativity. She gives you. We learnt from Her how beautiful things She has produced, and you try to reproduce it.<br>
......<br>
But people who have the feeling of oneness with the Mother Earth try to make things to express their joy that they are feeling, from the beauty She has created.<br>
......<br>
But only thing that really binds us is our love -- together. And this love is not a blind love. So, this love is the truth. And this love is not only the truth but is a knowledge.<br>
......<br>
And when that enjoyment starts within you, when you start enjoying other Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoga, forgetting what your past, what your religion, what your race, what your family, and what your, you can say the countries you come from, then one must say that Sahaja Yoga has worked on you really and you are a real Sahaja Yogi.<br>
But [if] you cannot enjoy, then definitely there's something wrong somewhere.<br>
This is the sign that you are a Sahaja Yogi.<br>
Moreover, collectivity if you cannot enjoy, then definitely there's something wrong with you."<br>

"Look at how children cry for the mother!<br>
[To the child:] I am your Mother here sitting! [Laughter. Laughs.]<br>
That's why Christ has said, ``You have to be like children": crying for the Mother, loving the Mother, feeling all the protection in your Mother. Goes much deeper than when He said, ``You have to be like children." Of course, you have to be innocent like them, simple like them, but also the way they care for the mother. <br>
Children don't care for the father. Father is sitting next to her, doesn't matter. [Laughter.]<br>
......<br>
So, all such things can be thought out and can be worked out so that Sahaja Yoga is put into action. The desire portion is over [Sahaja Yogi laughs], or is started, or is working out, but desire must be put into action. People also should see that you are doing something special about yourself. That's how the Sahaja Yoga is going to be very public: people are going to see in the public how the Sahaja Yoga is working out. Uh everybody can think of something like that.<br>
And you shouldn't worry too much about marketing. We'll find out the markets. If it markets well and good. But gradually it will market out, I'm sure, and you will go to the right place for marketing.<br>
You should get sufficient satisfaction out of it, because you've done something really exceptional which gives vibrations. Because Sahaja Yogis, whatever they sell, has got vibrations. So you are also spreading vibrations all around.<br>
Like, imagine a cup made by a Sahaja Yogi. Imagine! That fellow has to be realized only drinking the tea! [Laughter.]<br>
So whatever things they are using, you have to manage through your hands to vibrate it. Is not materialism, but it is Divine Materialism, where the matter is made divine.<br>
