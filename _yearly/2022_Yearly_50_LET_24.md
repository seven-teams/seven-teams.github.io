"After His assumption, Christ descended on this Earth in a hidden place while the Holy Spirit [Śhrī Mary Mahālakṣhmī] stayed back to inspire the faith of the early Christians. After Her assumption She joined Her Son and They lived together for many years in Kashmir. They are buried there."<br>

"Mahātmā Gāndhī says that ahiṃsā, i.e., nonviolence is the only way we can get rid of war. It is true that Indians fought the British with nonviolent methods to achieve their freedom. But nonviolent methods to gain freedom may sometimes result in the sacrifice of great lives for the country, when the ruling power uses brutal methods. This is what happened in India in several instances. Fortunately by Divine Blessing a Labour Government came into power in the United Kingdom immediately after the end of the Second World War. This Government initiated a process voluntarily which resulted in India's independence. Unfortunately, not all countries have the same good luck. There are numerous instances of dependent countries having to sacrifice a great many precious lives to gain freedom."<br>

"For example today I saw the flag, Independence: when we got [it] we made this flag. I'd seen this flagned [flag] being brought down, and put up when the other flag was brought down [in August 1947]. I cannot tell you what was the feeling that governed Me. Such a feeling, that the Truth has, some or other, overcome the untruth. That justice has been shown over the injustice. That feeling is still so much, I can't even see the flag. If I see it, I remember the whole history, the whole thing: how many people sacrificed, how many martyrs there were, how much people have fought for it, that flag stands for that.<br>
And you stand for all that. You stand for all those ideals, you stand for all those sacrifices, and you stand for all that is to be achieved for bettering human beings.<br>
You have to achieve a great deal for others. You have to work, within yourself, what you can do for others, what you can achieve for others, what is the best way to imbibe those qualities within yeall [you] that you become a[n] absolutely unique personality."<br>

[Śhrī Mātājī reminisced about Her time with Gāndhī in his āśhram and said that he was such a simple, disciplined and straightforward man.]<br> 
[She explained that his khādī movement killed the textile industry in Manchester, England and that they used to even have a song that if we use home spun, the factories will stop. Dr. David Szpiro, who was present at the time, is from Manchester and confirmed that in fact there is no textile industry in Manchester today.]<br>
[Śhrī Mātājī explained that when Her father was jailed for 6 months during the struggle for independence, She knew true poverty for the first time because he was the primary earner. Her father was the only prominent Christian jailed at the time.]<br>
[Śhrī Mātājī went on to say that the English were wise to withdraw, but that She still didn't fully understand why because this has never happened before. She said there was no war or conflict and that without this, occupying countries do not leave, so the English had some wisdom.]<br>
[Śhrī Mātājī said that the Nehru dynasty had not been good for India, and that had Gāndhī become the president, India would be a very different country today.]<br>

<b>Objectives:</b><br>
13. To employ the energy of love to overcome hatred that is the cause of wars, disintegration and destruction by publishing and relating the spiritual experiences of Sadhakas which prove the universal laws of love.<br>
20. To counteract through mass spiritual power the destructive forces against spiritualism such as evil spirits, the cult of hypnotism, siddhis and the use of ``religion" for the exploitation of the innocent.<br>
