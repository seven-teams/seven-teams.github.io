</p>

<p>
"Now, in the Dwāpar [Tretā] Yuga when Śhrī Rāma came, the idea of ... kingship, kingship, and rulership started. So-o, the greatest emphasis was on the goodwill of the people. The people had to have goodwill: for the people, and for the king, and for the betterment of humanity. The will, that is the right side.<br>
So how to create the goodwill?<br>
......<br>
First the leader has to sacrifice and show how far he can go in sacrificing to keep the moral and the goodwill of the people.<br>
......<br>
You see, 'formality of the heart'. You see to, not to say something, in such a way, that eh-eh-you touch the wrong side of the person ...... is saṅkocha.<br>
......<br>
So this saṅkoch one has to learn, the maryādā: means the boundaries of your relationships with [<font color="orange">unclear</font>].<br>
......<br>
The saṅkocha is a complete cultural stuff. So, we have a cultural tradition which we have to learn from Śhrī Rām.<br>
......<br>
Nothing works out without maryādā."<br>
