"So the basis or the essence of the Swādhiṣhṭhāna chakra, though is esthetics, the force and the energy of Swādhiṣhṭhāna chakra is attention. If you have a wobbly attention, if your attention is one minute here, one minute there, if you have an attention by which you just can criticize others and cannot see your own faults, if you have an attention by which you show people that you are a frivolous, nonsensical person, then your Guru Principle is wasted. It is the effort of Sahaja Yoga that is wasted, and your Guru's job is also wasted.<br>
......<br>
So the whole system becomes different if you understand that we have to base all our progress, all our love, all our movements, all our behavior, all our understanding on love. Otherwise your Guru Principle is extremely weak, and after some time you will find you are just standing out of the shores of Sahaja Yoga.<br>
......<br>
So, we reach a conclusion that, 'First we must develop our own Guru Principle.' If we cannot develop that, it is no use doing any Guru Pūjā. Because it is just temporary, is not going to help you much, unless and until you really decide that you are going to nourish and develop and establish your Guru Principle.<br>
......<br>
So, all of you are here, I'm very happy to see that you have come to worship Me as your Guru. And I would expect that My children are after My own image, that My image should be such that My children should feel that Oneness with My image, and I should be a proud Mother of so many children who have come from so many countries."<br>
