</p>

<p>
"Now, today is the day to make a big determination that you will start enjoying your Collective Spirit. Everything for the collectivity. Then the enjoyment will be maximum. You will never feel that you have sacrificed anything.<br>
......<br>
So, you must make a determination not to lea... bring Sahaja Yoga to your personal level, or to your limited problems, or to your own relationships. It is the relationship of the Creation with God. Is not your relationship of anybody else's relationship. As in any machine, all the wires must be connected to the mains through one main wire, in the same way you all must be connected to God individually so that you all are connected among yourself. I've been saying this again and again and again because, at Sahasrāra, you are being blessed of this Collective Spirit.<br>
The second very important point is of complete integration within and without.<br>
......<br>
And it comes: first of all is sincerity. First of all is complete sincerity.
......<br>
So you try to feel it from your heart: that's what it means sincerity. Do not depend on anyone: your wife, husband, children, nothing, mother, father. It's your own!<br>
So, you have to work in such a way that you get complete integration. And the driving force towards integration is a very simple one: is sincerity. Thus, you will know that automatically you are getting integrated.<br>
......<br>
And then sincerity itself is rewarding. This principle must be written down in your hearts: that sincerity itself is rewarding. You don't have to go to anybody else to ask first the reward of sincerity, sincerity itself rewards you. And that's why you start enjoying your own sincerity.<br>
......<br>
Try to become sincere and sincere and sincere and enjoy your sincerity.<br>
I bless you all with your sincerity."<br>
