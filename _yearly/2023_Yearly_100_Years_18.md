</p>

<p>
"For your own life, is very important that you should grow fully into the understanding of the powers that you have got and the love that your Mother has.<br>
When you say you must surrender yourself to Mother, means what? What do you have to surrender? Meah ... ah ... just think of it. What you are surrende-ring is what is pervert in you, whatever is destructively, whatever that misleads you, whatever is your ego and your conditioning. That's all you are sir... surrendering: just to purify yourself, to enjoy yourself, and to know God Almighty.<br>
......<br>
Somebody asked Me, uh, ``Is it necessary to have this Pūjā?", [laughing:] I think, if there's any Pūjā that you should do, it is this one, is [of] Ādi Śhakti. Is very important that this Pūjā must be performed. Because that is how you grow, this reflection improves, and you grow more and more within yourself, through the Power of Ādi Śhakti or through the power of Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
As you know that: Ādi Śhakti has Her own Kuṇḍalinī, which is the Ādi Kuṇḍalinī, and the reflection of that, within you, is the Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
So you have to worship. And is the best way to please your own Kuṇḍalinī, your own mother, who has given you this birth.<br>
......<br>
[After the offerings of gifts:] But one thing you have to remember that: you have a compassion that acts -- the compassion that acts. You are special."<br>
