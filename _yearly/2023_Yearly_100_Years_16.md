<font size="+2"><b>A Personality That Does Not React</b><br></font>
</p>

<p>
"Something special has happened to you: that, the whole of Brahmachaitanya, the whole Ocean, has taken the form of a cloud, that's Ādi Śhakti, and has come on this Earth to shower the Chaitanya on you people, enrich you, nurture you, develop you, by manifesting the love in such a manner that you have entered into the body of the Ādi Śhakti.<br>
So like one pitcher which is in the River Ganges, you are like a cell in the body of the Ādi Śhakti. Your entity, your personality is preserved. Despite that, you feel the Brahmachaitanya through your senses, and you can give Realizations to others. But you are in the body of the Ādi Śhakti. As long as you are in the boy ... body of Ādi Śhakti, you can do all that.<br>
This is the greatest thing that has happened: the whole of the Sahasrāra has opened out with all the seven Pīṭhas of all the Deities, who were just part and parcel of it. The whole of it has come in the form of a Mother who is humble, who is [smiling:] deceptive, illusive, who is Mahāmāyā. Is the greatest thing that could happen to human beings and to the whole universe: that, now, you can get your Realization, you can give Realizations to others, you can understand through your senses, through your logic what is vibrations, what it does.<br>
......<br>
This aggressiveness has to go from your heart! It has to get out of it!<br>
There's no place in My body for aggressive people: no place at all. I have not aggressed you, and you shouldn't aggress Me. If you aggress any Sahaja Yogi, you are aggressing Me.<br>
......<br>
That's a very important part of S-s-sahasrāra, because ego covers a great part of Sahasrāra. And if your Sahasrāra is covered with this ego business, how can I help you and how can I help Myself?<br>
Now so many of you are in My body, just imagine, circulating fast, and most of them are fighting to be in My heart, but they are settling in My ego.<br>
Well, I am egoless! Because I have no reactions.<br>
If you have no reaction, you cannot develop ego.<br>
I've no reactions. I'm reactionless. I am in My own peace and glory, trying to work out Sahaja Yoga. I do not r-react to anything.<br>
But your reactions trouble Me, because you are within Me.<br>
......<br>
So, this kind of ... a crackness, or this-ss, what you call this-s-ss madness, aggressive madness, comes from ego going to the level of superego. And they go ... get, first of all, `What's wrong?'<br>
......<br>
So have that satisfaction and glory of your own being and of your own standard, and of your own caliber. The others are not of your caliber all right: forget about it.<br>
That should not give you ego, but should give you a personality that does not re-act! We have something of our own, we do not re-act to things! We are not reactionaries-s."<br>
