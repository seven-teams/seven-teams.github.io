"There are lots of things that are happening within you. There are cosmic changes that are taking place today within you. I know that it's happening.<br>
The Śhrī Chakra Itself has descended on this Earth and already the Satya Yuga has started. This is the reason why you are feeling these vibrations on your fingers, and none of these Gurus and Ṛiṣhis and all those people have mentioned these things. Because this is only possible when the Śhrī Chakra is brought down.<br>
It is here. You have to feel it and understand it. It is for all of you to accept it with a[n] open heart.<br>
I do not want anything from you. What can you give Me? I do not want anything, but I want My children to be happy. I pray for their happiness. I live for them and all the time, whether I am asleep or a... awakened or in the middle state, when they call the sambhrānta [confused (state)], I am just with you. Every moment you are in My thought."<br>
