<p>
"Today is a great day when we are celebrating Mahālakṣhmī's Pūjā.<br>
You must be knowing that today is the day of Mary, Mother of Christ, who was Mahālakṣhmī.<br>
Mahālakṣhmī's Incarnation is very important for Sahaja Yoga.<br>
First, She establishes our dharma, by which we become righteous, we become religious in the real sense. After the light of Realization we cannot do anything that is not dharma.<br>
As you know what is dharma is, and the maryādās, the boundaries of our behavior.<br>
......<br>
By the ascent, with this Principle, you achieve a personality by which you become a Universal Being. You understand the problems of your country and of your race, and you transcend to see what's wrong with them and how to correct them.<br>
......<br>
Even people come to Sahaja Yoga and they start going either to the left or to the right. One has to keep a proper watch. Because you have come to Sahaja Yoga to ascend.<br>
Now, if you move to the right side, then you start fighting with your leader, finding faults with the leader, and, as Christ has said, you become "murmuring souls": you start talking ill about the leader. 
......<br>
There is no need to start some new methods.<br>
If [they do] so, they should get out of Sahaja Yoga. This is the worst type of ego!<br>
And one should not have anything to do with such people.<br>
Already, everything has been researched in Sahaja Yoga. All the knowledge is already there.<br>
......<br>
The Christianity has failed because they did ... did not recognize the Powers of Mary."<br>
