"Now we have got, astrologically there are three and a half auspicious days, where you don't have to consultant any uh-uh-uh ... any ... books of astrology, which are called as Pañchāṅg, to find out whether it is an auspicious time or not. For any Pūjā, for any [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] good work you have to do, people consultant, in India, the Pañchāṅg, is the book to find out which date is auspicious [and] which is not.<br>
One of them is today. Is a day you can do anything good, you decide anything good. Today is the day to take an oath, to think of something great, to visualize something big, to ask a boon, to do a big Pūjā, is-s one of the greatest uh-uh-uh day. One of the, we call them muhūrtas, which, where you do not consultant these books.<br>
......<br>
But then we gradually realize that there are lots of problems with our us ... own being, and the Kuṇḍalinī goes back into it, comes up again, and you realize that you have to correct yourself quite a lot.<br>
Then this correction portion starts. You start thinking about yourself more than about others. And also other things which were identified with us, like our own personal problems, our own personal ideas, ambitions-s-s, professions-s-s, and all the things that, with which we have been enamored so far, start peeping into our minds. And we start forgetting that moment when we got our Realization, and all that we promised within ourselves to do.<br>
So, the New [Year] Day comes to remind you: 'Doesn't matter, whatever has happened has happened, is finished. Today a new day has come to you again for you to promise again. Again start your journey, know the sun has come. And now, be refreshed. The newness bring[s] the freshness-s-s of life.' And then you again start, greater enthusiasm on the New [Year] Day, with new ideas, with new promises, with new vows, and with greater understanding about Sahaj Yog. "<br>
