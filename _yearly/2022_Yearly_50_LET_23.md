"So you should not make them attend any Pūjā, minimum, and also seminars I would say. Because seminars are meant for people who are intensively in Sahaja Yoga, to inse ... intensify their awareness, you see, not for people who are half-baked, who are Doubting Thomases, all these kind of people are absolutely useless, you should never bring them to seminar. Whether it's your son, father, brother, mother, sister, husband, wife, nothing doing. You shouldn't bring anybody who is not fully awakened Sahaj Yogi, because seminars are meant for very intensive work.<br>
And what I find, always these people will argue with Me, they are the first to question, they have something to say, [laughing:] they are the ones! [Laughing:] Sahaja Yogis are keeping quiet and receive it. I don't mind even that, but what happens in the seminar, you have to receive more. And they do not receive, their attention is outside, they are disturbing everyone.<br>
So, seminars are even, in a way, more important than an Āśhram, because in Āśhram there's no other problem but to fight them out. But here, in a new place we go, we have to fight out's all surroundings, the place itself has to be cleansed, everything has to be done. On top of that you have these terrible people around you, whom you have to convince. If they are not convinced, why are they here? Why did they spend so much money to come down? Be sure, they have come here to disturb us.<br>
......<br>
So that is for the people who have to have the privilege of this worship. Today is specially a great privilege because it was not so planned, but it worked out, just worked out.<br>
......<br>
So, sucking should be more. Sucking should be more. And just before the Pūjā you should say: `Mother, make me such that I suck more of the Divine!' Just pray that, with sincerity from your heart, just say that. [Twelve seconds of silence.]"<br>
