<font size="+2"><b>Leadership Means That You Should Be Able To Execute Sahaja Yoga Principles In Others</b><br></font>
</p>

<p>
"In your lives if people will see that you are very peaceful, good, helpful, collective people, then only, Sahaja Yoga will spread.<br>
.......<br>
And so I would request you, all of you, to be little generous. The generosity should be towards social side of our world, which is very important to be attended to.<br>
I hope you understand that I have not changed the way. It's the path which is going now in a smooth way. We had to first climb a very hazardous mountain, and now we have come to a place where we understand.<br>
......<br>
It will be very kind of you to understand that all these problems can be solved by you, I don't have to be there. I am there with you all the time, I am one with you all the time, so there is no need for you to come to Me for all these things which are absolutely under your control. If not, you give up your leadership, so-called. Because leadership means that you should be able to execute Sahaja Yoga principles in others and work it out. I hope you'll understand this.<br>
.......<br>
You have come here to get vibrations, to get more and more of that and not to wile away your time talking this, that. No! You have come here to grow."<br>
