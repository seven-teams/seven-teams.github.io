"Today you have arranged this worship of your Guru, that is your Mother. Perhaps you are very unique people that have a Guru who is a Mother. <br>
......<br>
The Pūjā is arranged because you have been initiated into the Statutes of the Lord. You have been told what are the dharmas of a human being.<br>
......<br>
Let's see what are the Statutes. First is: 'You do not harm anyone.' First principle is that we are not to harm anyone. ...... Animals [human beings] are not to harm anyone! They can correct but not harm.<br>
......<br>
The second Statute is that you have to stu ... stand on your own legs and know that you are here one with the Truth, the testimony. The testimony of the Truth: that you have seen the Truth, you know what Truth is, and you cannot compromise with falsehood, you cannot.<br>
......<br>
Third is the detachment, the way I have told you about detachment: not to get attached to any one person, because he's a relation or a some thing, but develop a universal feeling. And also not to hate anyone!<br>
......<br>
Now the fourth thing, the fourth Statute of the Lord is: 'To lead a moral life.'<br>
......<br>
But today I authorize you to be the gurus, so that through your own character and through your own personalities, the way you practice Sahaja Yoga in your own life and manifest the light, others will follow you. And that you will establish the Statutes of Lord in their hearts and emancipate them, give them their salvation, because you have got your salvation.<br>
......<br>
Imbibe all the Statutes within you, and be proud about it. Don't be misguided by what people are talking, multitudes are talking. We are going to pull the whole multitude towards ourself. First of all let us establish our weight, the gravity. As Mother Earth keeps everybody pulling towards Her, we'll be pulling all of them to ourselves.<br>
......<br>
Today, all of you must, within yourself, to your Spirit, promise that you will be a guru worthy of your Mother. [Silence for 25 seconds.]"<br>
