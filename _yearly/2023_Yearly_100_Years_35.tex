"So, today is the day of thankfulness for Christ's uh Advent on this Earth. And we have to see that, as He is our eldest brother, we can say, He is our leader, we have to how ... follow His foots... footsteps. In our Resurrection, we have to show that we have imbibed the qualities-s which are Christ-like, illuminating the whole Universe with our enlightened lives.<br>
The very big responsibility on Sahaja Yogis to understand that when we are celebrating today the birth of Christ, we stand for something very much beautiful, pure and glorious.<br>
......<br>
In the same way, we should try to keep our purity above everything else. The most important thing for us is to be pure people. Pure: pure from heart, pure in our morality, pure in our thinking and pure in our rapport that we have with others.<br>
......<br>
So the first and foremost thing we have to as... aspire is purity, as you know very well that Ādi Śhakti first created Śhrī Gaṇeśha who is the Symbol of Purity.<br>
So today we have to take a vow, that, 'Henceforth, we are going to follow a life of complete purity and detachment.' That's not so difficult if you understand Sahaj Yog. If you are Sahaja Yogis is very easy to purify yourself."<br>
