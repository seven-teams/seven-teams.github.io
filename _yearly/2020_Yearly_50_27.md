"So, Sahaja Yoga today is the thing which proves what has been said so far. It proves. Is not just a cock and bull story. Because people do not believe into all these things. They think that, `It's all cock and bull story. Who was Christ? Who was Kṛiṣhṇa? Who was Rādhā? After all, there was no God.'<br>
But only in Sahaja Yoga, today, we can prove it, that what we say is the Truth.<br>
......<br>
Now, we must say that Sahaja Yoga, as it is today, is the most ancient thing. It started with the Universe. And now the culmination pound ... point has come, because it's a living process.<br> 
As you see a flower on the tree, it's it says, the first new flower. But the flower has come out of a seed, which has got the roots, then it became the trunk, then it became the leaves, and then it has now become a flower. So though it looks a new flower, it has a big heritage.<br>
In the same way, Sahaja Yoga is as ancient as this universe is.<br>
......<br>
So the task of Sahaja Yoga is to establish the Truth within yourself. It is not that we can have a membership. We cannot have a person enroll into it, we cannot call them as uh-uh-uh branded Sahaja Yogis: is the growth of the person that is to be seen."<br>
