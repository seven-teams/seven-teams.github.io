<font size="+2"><b>Single-handed She Took Upon Herself The Responsibility Of Making The People Cross The Bhavasāgara</b><br></font>
</p>

<p>
"So when we read about the Devī, about Her Incarnations, how She came on this Earth to save Her bhaktas, people who were trying to ascend, to cross this Bhavasāgara, how She worked hard, how She fought the devils, how She cough... She killed the demons, single-handed, She took upon Herself the responsibility of making the people cross the Bhavasāgara.<br>
Guru gave you the strength to have dharma but She is the One who brought you out. Even those who were dhārmik could not do it because of the demonic pressure. She's the One who fought, single-handed, with Her Powers of destruction. In Her Love for you She fought. She brought you to this level.<br>
And then She took a milder form of Incarnation. Even during the time of all the Gurus, She took the Form of, as you know: Jānakī was the daughter of Janaka, then Fāṭimah was the daughter of Muhammad Sāhab, and Nāṇakī was the sister of Nāṇaka. In those Forms, these Powers s... sustained and nourished the Guru Tattwa. And later on, or sometimes simultaneously, They incarn-nated [incarnated] in milder forms to help human beings to rise.<br>
So, today is the Day of Thanksgiving. As Guru Pūjā is a day of thanksgiving to your Guru: the One who has counseled you, the One who has told you about the Truth, the One who has taught you the Truth and has given you Realization.<br>
And the Devī Pūjā is a thanksgiving where, single-handed, just like a very loving Mother, under Her sāṛī, She protected you, fought for you, fought with every enemy that is around, every sort of problems that existed, and ultimately brought you to Sahasrāra level and then gave you Realization. It's a real thanksgiving to the Mother.<br>
So we can say Navarātri is like a Mother's Day, where you give thanksgiving to Her: which was just relentless, continuous-s-s working for Her children."<br>
