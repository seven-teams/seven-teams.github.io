That's the day, when, I mean it is regarded as the most auspicious day to start anything."<br>

"But many people think that today is a day when, whatever you ask, God has to give you. Is true. Whatever you ask, you'll get it. But [is] just a temptation.<br>
Beyond that, is eternity. So whatever you have to ask, you should ask for something that is eternal, is indust ... indestructible. That higher state, we should call the Permanent State of Joy and Bliss, is to be asked today. Because all other askings are useless. And you again go back to the position where you were.<br>
Is important to understand, that this time, today, you have to ask something eternal for yourself, something eternal for your family, something eternal for your country, and something eternal for this world and universe.<br>
You all are Sahaja Yogis, and of a very high level, and I'm happy that the all of you have come here for that Eternal State of Devī.<br>
And, if it works out, you should get that Eternal State [with]in yourself. You should get that state where you don't want anything anymore. and reside in that beautiful condition of complete peace and bliss. That's what is available to you, but I ... you can easily achieve it.<br>
......<br>
So, today I hope, you all .. of you will pray and ask for that Eternal Love of God. It should flow to you all, all the time."<br>

"So, today is a day when you have to promise Me that you'll meditate every night, every evening, maybe in the morning also. Whenever it is possible, if you can go into meditative mood, you are in contact with this Divine Power. Then whatever is good for you, whatever good for your society, for your country, all is done by this Divine Power. You don't have to overpower the Divine Power. You don't have to order, you don't have to ask. Just if you meditate, you are one with this All-pervading Power which is another great blessings to us. "<br>
