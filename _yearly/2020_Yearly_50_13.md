</p>

<p>
"You see, you must know what a unique thing is Sahaja Yoga: how it has redeemed you, how you have [it has] transformed you and you have landed into such a beautiful area in, of God's Kingdom.<br>
......<br>
That's what you have to do: is to spread Sahaja Yoga as much as possible.<br>
......<br>
But first of all you have a duty to spread Sahaja Yoga.<br>
Secondly, it is for you to enjoy Sahaja Yoga, but also to see that by your behavior you don't trouble other Sahaja Yogis all over the world.<br>
......<br>
But they have never put any pressure on. To them Sahaja Yoga is their life, Sahaja Yoga is their aim, and Sahaja Yoga is totality."<br>
