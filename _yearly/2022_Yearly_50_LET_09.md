<font size="+2"><b>Understand The Value Of Human Life</b><br></font>
</p>

<p>
"Today, we talk of a population problem. Perhaps many animals have taken birth. You can see the effect of that, the way people are behaving, you can be sure that many animals must have taken life and they have yet to go [undergo a] lot of evolution and training as a human being to understand the value of human life. But once a human being starts evolving within himself.<br>
Now, we have been hue ... human beings, as they say, for fourteen thousand years -- I think it is even more than that. So we have been human beings, say, for fourteen thousand years. We have been inside growing through our freedom. Human beings are the only people who get freedom to evolve themselves, to understand what is wrong and what is bad. This freedom is granted because without freedom you cannot go any further.<br>
......<br>
God has created this Holiness to protect His creation. This atmosphere of Holiness He created to protect all the people, all the creative things which are been there, which have been created by Him, otherwise nothing would work out. Just think: if one of the oceans was deeper even by ten feet, the balance of Earth would have toppled down. Just imagine what a speed this Mother Earth has, She revolves with such a tremendous speed, goes round the Sun regularly in a proper way, not in a round way, but in a special style as you know. She creates day and night for you: night to rest and day to work. How She Herself has created this beautiful atmosphere for you and has maintained the balance and the temperature that was given to Her, is only done by the Power of Holiness that was created around.<br>
Now, man in his foolishness is challenging that Holiness. He thinks he can challenge God. That's the sign of his dwarfness. If he had risen that height where he could feel God pulsating in everything, he would never have done that. But before he could reach that state of perfection, he has started talking about God. Who is going to challenge his authority of this stupid man, who doesn't want to achieve his perfection and wants to talk big?"<br>
