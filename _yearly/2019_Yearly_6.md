"So, this is the Time of this Transition, of this Resurrection, for which you don't have to do anything outside. It's only in your own body it will work. It's your right to have it. And as this flower has a right to flower and give fragrance, in the same way you have [the] right to be enlighten.<br> 

No obligation of Mine, I just love. Specially Russia, I really love you very much, because they are so lovable people. Like you respect Me also as Mother, I love you like My children. I don't know how to explain a Mother having millions of children [laughs], but it is so! And it is so energy giving to Me as well as to you. There is a rapport of love. I don't have to quarrel with you, argue with you, or to shout at you. It just works."<br>
