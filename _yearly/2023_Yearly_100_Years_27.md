"Only the innocence is the source of joy.<br>
......<br>
Why not ask: 'Śhrī Gaṇeśh, make us good instruments of Sahaja Yoga. Give us strength to give Realization to people and talk about Sahaja Yoga.'<br>
......<br>
So in the same way, without taking the permission of Śhrī Gaṇeśha, Kuṇḍalinī won't rise. Is very difficult, impossible I should say. Of course, the Mūlādhāra will go on like this, pumping just like a heart, but it won't come up because Kuṇḍalinī would like to do but He won't allow Her to go on.<br>
.......<br>
[You] must talk about it. You must tell people. You must go around. Don't be afraid! Gaṇeśha will protect you, He'll help you, He'll be very happy. He'll work it out everything for you. All problems can be solved. Everything can be done. Believe in His Power. Have faith in your Mother. That is the Message of Śhrī Gaṇeśha."<br>
