<font size="+2"><b>We Are Going To Surrender Ourselves To Mother</b><br></font>
</p>

<p>
"So, today you have to take some vows. And you have to say: that, 'We are going to do these things. We are going to talk about Sahaj Yog, we are going to propagate it, we are going to spread it. And what may come, we are going to surrender ourselves to Mother. Even, if She's supposing, scolds us, or says anything it is for our good. And we are not going to get confused.' And that's how you have to absolutely vow that you are going to dedicate yourself to Sahaj Yog to help others, to e... emancipate, and to create atmosphere for the completion of this universe, of this creation, for that fruitful day when we will say: that, 'The Kingdom of God has been brought on this Earth.'<br>
So today is not the day for Me to give, but for you. You have to announce.<br>
For example, you see then there is somebody who is in India, I do not know what is the position here, but supposing there is someone you want to celebrate or you want to reciprocate, then what they do? They write in the newspaper that: 'Such and such man has done so much for us, so, we uh ... we thank him very much for this.' In the paper, you see, you get a complete a-uh-uh ... three, four new... newspapers put together. Uh-uh-uh you will find all the such advertisement appeared, all like that.<br>
You see, so this is how: you do it, that you tell people, you talk to them and do it in this way, so that the publicity for Sahaja Yoga spreads, that you surrender yourself as a vehicle of this machine, of this great work. This is what God wants you to do.<br>
So today is a day of certain determinations, that, 'By such and such deed, or such and such time, we will have these things, and we will do these things.' This is what you have to today decide and think about it. And this is what you have to manage and this is what you have to give.<br>
This is the only thing that you can give to God: is to become the instruments of God, complete surrendering yourself [yourselves] to Him, so that this world of yours, this universe of yours, because I do not belong to any universe or any creation whatsoever.<br>
It doesn't matter with Me if this creation is gone or lives. It is for you people. It is only for you that you have to have this creation.<br>
And so, only thing that you can do: is to give Me the assurance that, 'I should feel that by creating this universe and by this world, God has not gone wrong. And by giving you Realization, I have not gone wrong, because you are going to help in the complete emancipation of humanity.'<br>
This is what Guru Pūrṇimā is.<br>
When you think on those lines, immediately you will know what you should do. For next Guru Pūrṇimā you have to plan it now.<br>
So maybe I don't know what in India they will do. They may have a big u-uh-uhh lecture, arranged in My absence, may arrange some big people to come and speak about Me, and talk about Me. I don't know what they will be doing.<br>
Of course I do not like you to take out the procession as these people are taking out. But there may be some methods, which you can think of, by which you can announce the Advent of a Guru as a Mother, who is trying to help the people to find what they are seeking."<br>
