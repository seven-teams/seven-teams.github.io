<font size="+2"><b>Greatest Weapon Of All</b><br></font>
</p>

<p>
"And in the Vaikuṇṭha Stage it is described very clearly how Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa Himself came to bless Him and told Him. that, ``You will be placed even higher than Me, because Your body will be made out of Chaitanya."<br>
Chaitanya, what is the English word for Chaitanya?<br> 
......<br>
Divine Awareness! Of the Divine Awareness. You can say is the Divine Awareness Itself, is the Divine Vibrations are shown in us.<br>
In the same way, He's made out of that like the ... like Śhrī Gaṇeśha is.<br>
Now if He's so or not, because most of you are Indians here, you might challenge it. You may. I can prove it to you. Because is the same Swastika. The āyudhas or the weapons of Śhrī Gaṇeśha have become avyakta, are not expressed. Because He used one weapon for all of them: is of forgiveness.<br>
And that is the Greatest Weapon of all, and that's why, at this stage when the Kuṇḍalinī goes, you have to take His name or you have to forgive people.<br>
Forgiveness is the Greatest Weapon that God has given us.<br>
Now it is for you to verify whether I say it is correct or not.<br>
But crucifixion is not the Message.<br>
Crucifixion is the explanation of what Kṛiṣhṇa preached, that the Chaitanya, the Divine Awareness, does not vanish, does not. It is akṣhara, it does not get killed. You cannot control it. And this was to be proved in His life through His Resurrection.<br>
The Resurrection is the Message of Christ.<br>
But as in India, you have done all the mess of all these Incarnations, they have done the mess of Christ, in two ways.<br>
One, by not respecting the celibacy of life. He was a celibate person. He was a holy person! Of course He respected the marriage institution because He attended the marriage. You have crucified Him again.<br>
And secondly, which is His Power of Forgiveness, Complete Power of Forgiveness.<br>
But they had empires! They now want to have e-conomic, what you call the economic controlling power, and all kinds of these things they are doing under the name of political, I don't know what they call it.<br>
They have to be Christians.<br>
All that was against Him is done now today, as the Indians have done all that what was against Hinduism."<br>
