<font color="DarkRed">"To make the people cross the Void (Bhavasāgara) He has to make some arrangement. So the Great Power like Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, Maheśha was created and they were placed in the Area of Dharma.<br>
Dattātreya and Ādi Gurus incarnated in this world many a times. He incarnated as King Janaka who was like the father of Ādi Śhakti. After that He incarnated in Iran as Zoroaster, then as Macchindranāth, then as Muhammad Sāheb and Nāṇak Sāheb.<br>
No one fought with each other. See what type of darkness you are in?<br>
Fāṭimah, the daughter of Muhammad Sāheb was the same who became daughter of King Janaka.<br>
Whom are you fighting? Think over it.<br>
The Nāṇakī of Guru Janaka was none else but Jānakī.<br>
Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth was also an Ādi Guru. They are the Masters of all.<br>
Also, They are My Gurus. These Ādi Gurus taught Me all this Knowledge. In different Incarnations They kept Me teaching. Ultimately I had to come and do His work. They could not do it and now they are placing Me as a Guru so that I take up the job of a Guru.<br>
There was an age when no one was willing to accept a woman as a Guru but in Kali Yuga only Mother could do His work: it is beyond the power of men.<br>
This work could not be done by force, only the love of a Mother could do it because already there is so much pressure, tension in this world. The day it is forced upon the human being they will break down. So, love is the only way out.<br>
So this Gurudom was given to Me. Everything is acceptable to Me.<br>
But I didn't know the qualities of a Guru.<br>
Gurus maintain distance but mother does not keep distance with the children. Children sit on her head.<br>
So, you people also could take liberty with Me and enjoy. Be with Me with full freedom, you will neither be afraid nor be embarrassed. There is no problem, you could come and talk to Me boldly about your problems. You could complain to Me as you do to your mother. I am freely available to you.<br>
Freedom was needed, religion was required to be discussed openly, there is no secret, no secret about it. Ultimately everything has to be explained very clearly. All the secrets are to be told about, everything could not be said everywhere."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"But before reaching the Heart chakra, the gap I showed you, is all the Bhavasāgara. In the center is the seat of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, and on it Śhrī Brahmadeva creates the whole universe. He made this Bhavasāgara.<br>
After creating the Bhavasāgara, the question was, 'How to cross it over? The human being was created, but how to make him realize it? How to make human beings recognize it? In him, how to activate the Brahma Tattwa?' Meaning, 'How to get the Union of Śhiva and Śhakti within him? How would the connection be established?'<br>
For this, a special personality was created in this world. This was created by the combined essence of Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, and Maheśh, who we acknowledge as Śhrī Dattātreya. Śhrī Dattātreya is none other than Ādi Guru.<br>
He is My Guru. He has mentored Me all His past lives.<br>
If you hear about His birth and all His previous lives you would be amazed. We have forgotten such a great thing.<br>
Śhrī  Dattātreya's Incarnations are numerous. Firstly He came as King Janaka. Śhrī Sītājī was His daughter, who was the embodiment of Śhakti Herself. Then He came as Macchindranāth, Zoroaster, and Muhammad Sāhab, who were a completely different type of human being.<br>
They trialed out lots of different things. Śhrī Datta, the Primordial Masters firstly in this world educated us about the symbolic forms within us. And then also said that, "You people got entangled in symbolism, in idol worshiping." Their meaning was to go beyond and recognize the Śhakti within these idols. That's why They talked about the idols.<br>
For example, there is a flower, and to describe the honey within the flower, They talked about the flower first, from which the people would taste the honey. But people got stuck to flower. So Then they took Incarnations and talked about the honey.<br>
In that, They talked about God in the abstract. They deliberately didn't talk about the reincarnation of life.<br>
Because as soon as you talk about past lives, people ask Me, "Mātājī, tell me about my past lives." The life that has passed, why do you want to know that? Whether you were a king or a pauper, what difference it will make?<br>
That's why They did not discuss past lives.<br>
Muhammad Sāhab was the same, Dattātreya's Incarnation, and the same Incarnation was King Janaka. The same Incarnation was Nāṇaka, whose sister Nāṇakī, was the same Ādi Śhakti. She was Sītājī.<br>
......<br>
I always say, "If a Muslim gets obstructed from getting his Realization, you take the name of Dattātreya." And if [a] Hindu gets obstructed, I say, 'You take Muhammad Sāhab's name.' "</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"The same Śhrī Dattā incarnated many a times on the Earth.<br>
As I told you yesterday, King Janaka was one of them. King Janaka was the father of Jānakī [Śhrī Sītā]. He was none other than the Incarnation of Śhrī Dattātreya.<br>
Thereafter, Macchindranāth, most have you must have heard His name, was also His Incarnation.<br>
After that Zoroaster who came three times on the Earth, He was also His Incarnation.<br>
After that Muhammad Sāhab, who was His Incarnation.<br>
And when He was asked that, "Bhāī [Brother] there must have been others also before you," then He replied, "Yes, there [was] a Muhammad." Then again He was asked who was before him. He replied, "There was one Muhammad."<br>
Muhammad means Praise, the One who is praised, the One who deserves to be praised and is the One who is Redeemer of the world. They were all Muhammads, they were all Dattātreyas, who came on Earth regularly.<br>
After that [was] Nāṇaka, Guru Nāṇaka. If you ever read His teachings, if you read His talks then you will be surprised that He has always talked in a Sahaja. He has said, "Sahaja Samādhi lago." He has said, "Kāhe re ban khojan jāe, Sarab nivāsī sadā alepā tohī saṃg[a] samāī, Puṣhpamadhya jo bāsa basata hai mukara māhī jaise chhāī, Taise hī harī base niraṃtara ghaṭa hī khojo bhāī." "Why to go to forest to find Him, He is always there with you just like there is a fragrance in a flower and just as the reflection is there in a mirror, in the same way God is residing in you eternally seek Him within. He is just inside, achieve Him just inside. We are just singing poem, singing songs, we are just cramming His prescription."<br>
The talk of seeking this Absolute Principle, residing just inside the heart, has been made since ancient times by these Ādi Gurus, who are incarnated on this Earth again and again.<br>
......<br> 
After Nāṇak Sāhab, around fifty, sixty years ago in our Maharashtra Dattātreya incarnated as Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī. If you want proof of it, then you get your Realization and after that if you put your hand on anyone, then you will get vibration of same kind: from just vibration only you can know about all.<br>
As you must have eyes to see any shape, its color, in the same way you are required to feel vibrations so that you may know all the gurus of the world and will be able to know as who is a true guru and who is a liar, who is equal to that Incarnation of Ādi Guru Dattātreya, for mere saying there are thousands of guru in modern times. No one become guru just by saying of another. And by believing in him also, he does not become a guru."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"When someone gets cancer, he can be cured by either Nāṇak Sāhib or Muhammad Sāhib, no one else. Because what we call Void, is known to doctors, we call it Bhavasāgar, Dattātreya, who is Ādi Guru, who helps us in crossing Bhavasāgar, where all Gurus are present, unless you take the name of one of Them, you are not going to be free from problems of Bhavasāgar, which manifests as cancer. You can recognize cancer from the throb here. You cannot be cured. "</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"But in some people that stability has to be brought about. No problem. You have obtained that thing, you recognized it, you reached there and there is a complete arrangement for bringing stability.<br>
As soon as that stability is achieved, in Absolute Peace and Joy, you achieve that Witness State described by Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, by Jesus, by all the Scriptures whether by Zoroaster, Socrates, Confucius or any of Dattātreya's Incarnations."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Then comes the most important part of our body, is the stomach. It represents the Bhavasāgara. Is the māyā, in which we are placed.<br>
We are born in this Bhavasāgara, when Śhrī Vriṣhṇu [Viṣhṇu] Himself incarnates again and again -- you have seen as Matsya Avatāra, Kūrma Avatāra -- and He Himself leads the human beings in their evolutionary path.<br>
He is helped by another, another Deity, whom we call as Primordial Guru: the Ādi Guru Dattātreya.<br>
Śhrī Viṣhṇu rises from Bhavasāgara, and gives you the leadership to rise within yourself. He builds up your awareness, step by step, and today you are as ... as a human being.<br>
......<br>
Now the ... these three aspects, the essence of these aspects, or we can say the innocence of these three aspects, is combined in the Primord[i]al Guru, or the Ādi Guru Dattātreya, who resides in the Bhavasāgara and helps Śhrī Viṣhṇu for your evolution.<br>
Now He has taken many Incarnations, mainly Ten Incarnations. And these are very important, and we have to understand Them in Their full entirety.<br>
If you accept Him as Dattātreya, you have to also accept Him as Rāja Janaka.<br>
It's easy for a Hindu mind to accept Rāja Janaka, but they cannot accept Muhammad Sāhab, who was same as Rāja Janaka. It is a fact which can ... we can prove it on your Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
A person who is suffering from cancer of the stomach -- now this is the thing, when I say that Sahaja Yoga can cure your cancer, you have to give up certain notions that we have in our hear... head.<br>
A person, eh supposing he's a Hindu, and he's suffering from the stomach cancer, I have to ask him to take the name of Muhammad Sāhab. If I fail to ask him or if I convince ... do not him ... convince Him, I cannot cure his can't ... cancer. I'm sorry, I tell him, 'I just cannot do it.' But if he is a Muslim, I have to tell him: 'You have to take the name of Dattātreya.'<br>
Human beings, like fools, have taken away the living flowers of one tree, and now are fighting on something that is dead.<br>
He was Dattātreya. There is no doubt about it.<br>
And His daughter Fāṭimah was nobody else but Sītā Jānakī Herself.<br>
And Her two sons, Hasan and Husayn, were nobody else but Lava and Kuśha. They were born again and again: They were born as Mahāvīra and Buddha, and then They were born as Hasan and Husayn.<br>
It is only possible through Sahaja Yoga to realize that this is the Truth, this is the fact.<br>
He was born as Nāṇaka. And Nāṇakī was nobody else but Jānakī.<br>
In Nāṇaka's life He has expressed it. Of course I don't know how many people have read about Nāṇak.<br>
Nāṇaka one day was sleeping, and His Feet were towards Kaaba. And people were getting vibrations from that side, so they said: "What are You doing your? Your Feet are towards Kaaba!" So He said, "All right, I'll turn My Feet's on the other side." And they started getting vibrations from the other side. They said, "What? Kaaba has moved or what?"<br>
He has, in a way, showed.<br>
'But how dare They say many things?' When They said very few thing[s], they have killed all these people and tortured Them.<br>
If you read Muhammad Sāhab['s] life, you will feel, 'What foolish people we have been, the way we have tortured [Him]!'<br>
For fanaticism the way He was killed!<br>
Actually was poisoned. He had no place where to hide His head the way people were after Him, because He was telling the Truth.<br>
And fanaticism is one thing He fought.<br>
So, Guru Tattwa is killed as soon as you become a fanatic person. Your Guru Tattwa is immediately finished, as soon as you take to fanaticism of any kind!"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Another thing is, here in Bhavasāgar, all Three, Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, Maheśhwar, combined to make a child, who is called Ādi Guru, is known as Dattātreya. There were many Incarnations of Him. And His Child Tattwa also took Incarnations. First was Dattātreya, then came Rāja Janak. Like this, many Incarnations came, Rāja Janak, Nāṇak, Zarathusrta, Muhammad Sāhab, Sāi Nāth of Śhirḍī.<br>
They are all one. Are They or not? You can witness it after Self-realization. If you believe in one Guru, like Nāṇak, then you have no right not to accept Muhammad Sāhab. If you get Muhammad Sāhab and not Nāṇak, then you have no authority as well."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"They are the same people! There are Ten of Them born like that. They are the same people born again and again. And They are the people, if you accept them, in only one Incarnation, They are not going to accept it. You have to accept Them in all Their Incarnations!<br>
I give an example. There was a doctor who was suffering from the cancer of stomach, Muslim. He met Me in London. And when I told him, that, "You have to worship Dattātreya," he got a shock of his life! He said, "You mean to say I must give up my religion?" I said, "Your religion is in ... in imbalance. He was the same as Muhammad Sāhab. Actually Dattātreya incarnated as Muhammad Sāhib." He said, "I cannot do that! I only believe in Muhammad Sāhab!" I said, "All right, I cannot cure your [] ... cancer because cancer is because of imbalance. Is too much activity on one side."<br>
Overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system causes cancer. You write it down today and you can verify it. And that's why when people say I've cured cancer, I have! No doubt! Not only Me, but even this doctor who is here he has cured cancer.<br>
Cancer is only curable through the balance of Sahaja Yoga. Otherwise is not possible! Take it from Me!<br>
So the imbalance of this man, he would not listen but cancer is a vague thing that way.<br>
He had to come back. "All right Mother, I accept You." I said, "All right. Now will you place to ... pray to ... pray to Dattātreya?"<br>
A Muslim has to become a Hindu, and a Hindu has to become a Muslim. A Sikh has to become a Muslim, and a Muslim has to become a Sikh."</font><br>

Water has the religion (Dharma) of cleansing and hence Shri VISHNU and DATTATREYA responsible for the religion (Dharma) of human beings are to be worshiped. They help you to cure and also the local Deity of the Chakra that is attacked. Put the patient before the photograph with the candle and his feet being in the water, bring down your hands across the sympathetic nervous system towards the water. The patient will cool down gradually. If he gets realization, then he is cured."</font><br>
