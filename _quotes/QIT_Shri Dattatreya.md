<font color="red">"To make the people cross the Void (Bhavasāgara) He has to make some arrangement. So the Great Power like Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, Maheśha was created and They were placed in the Area of Dharma.<br>
Dattātreya and Ādi Gurus incarnated in this world many a times. He incarnated as King Janaka who was like the father of Ādi Śhakti. After that He incarnated in Iran as Zoroaster, then as Macchindranāth, then as Muhammad Sāheb and Nāṇak Sāheb.</font><br>
No one fought with each other. See what type of darkness you are in?<br>
Fāṭimah, the daughter of Muhammad Sāheb was the same who became daughter of King Janaka.<br>
Whom are you fighting? Think over it.<br>
The Nāṇakī of Guru Nāṇaka was none else but Jānakī.<br>
<font color="red">Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth was also an Ādi Guru.<br> 
They are the Masters of all.</font><br>
<font color="red">Also, They are My Gurus. These Ādi Gurus taught Me all this Knowledge. In different Incarnations They kept Me teaching.<br> 
Ultimately I had to come and do His work. They could not do it and now They are placing Me as a Guru so that I take up the job of a Guru.<br>
There was an age when no one was willing to accept a woman as a Guru but in Kali Yuga only Mother could do His work: it is beyond the power of men.</font><br>
This work could not be done by force, only the love of a Mother could do it because already there is so much pressure, tension in this world. The day it is forced upon the human being they will break down. So, love is the only way out.<br>
So this Gurudom was given to Me. Everything is acceptable to Me.<br>
But I didn't know the qualities of a Guru.<br>
Gurus maintain distance but mother does not keep distance with the children. Children sit on her head.<br>
So, you people also could take liberty with Me and enjoy. Be with Me with full freedom, you will neither be afraid nor be embarrassed. There is no problem, you could come and talk to Me boldly about your problems. You could complain to Me as you do to your mother. I am freely available to you.<br>
Freedom was needed, religion was required to be discussed openly, there is no secret, no secret about it. Ultimately everything has to be explained very clearly. All the secrets are to be told about, everything could not be said everywhere."<br>

"But before reaching the Heart chakra, the gap I showed you, is all the Bhavasāgara. In the center is the seat of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, and on it Śhrī Brahmadeva creates the whole universe. He made this Bhavasāgara.<br>
After creating the Bhavasāgara, the question was, 'How to cross it over? The human being was created, but how to make him realize it? How to make human beings recognize it? In him, how to activate the Brahma Tattwa?' Meaning, 'How to get the Union of Śhiva and Śhakti within him? How would the connection be established?'<br>
<font color="red">For this, a special personality was created in this world. This was created by the combined essence of Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, and Maheśh, who we acknowledge as Śhrī Dattātreya. Śhrī Dattātreya is none other than Ādi Guru.<br>
He is My Guru. He has mentored Me all His past lives.<br>
If you hear about His birth and all His previous lives you would be amazed. We have forgotten such a great thing.<br>
Śhrī Dattātreya's Incarnations are numerous. Firstly He came as King Janaka. Śhrī Sītājī was His daughter, who was the embodiment of Śhakti Herself. Then He came as Macchindranāth, Zoroaster, and Muhammad Sāhab, who were a completely different type of human being.<br>
They trialed out lots of different things.<br> 
Śhrī Datta, the Primordial Masters firstly in this world educated us about the symbolic forms within us. And then also said that, "You people got entangled in symbolism, in idol worshiping." Their meaning was to go beyond and recognize the Śhakti within these idols. That's why They talked about the idols.</font><br>
<font color="red">For example, there is a flower, and to describe the honey within the flower, They talked about the flower first, from which the people would taste the honey. But people got stuck to flower. So Then they took Incarnations and talked about the honey.<br>
In that, They talked about God in the abstract. They deliberately didn't talk about the reincarnation of life.</font><br>
Because as soon as you talk about past lives, people ask Me, "Mātājī, tell me about my past lives." The life that has passed, why do you want to know that? Whether you were a king or a pauper, what difference it will make?<br>
<font color="red">That's why They did not discuss past lives.<br>
Muhammad Sāhab was the same, Dattātreya's Incarnation, and the same Incarnation was King Janaka. The same Incarnation was Nāṇaka,</font> whose sister Nāṇakī, was the same Ādi Śhakti. She was Sītājī.<br>
......<br>
I always say, "If a Muslim gets obstructed from getting his Realization, you take the name of Dattātreya." And if [a] Hindu gets obstructed, I say, 'You take Muhammad Sāhab's name.' "<br>

<font color="red">"The same Śhrī Dattā incarnated many a times on the Earth.<br>
As I told you yesterday, King Janaka was one of them. King Janaka was the father of Jānakī [Śhrī Sītā]. He was none other than the Incarnation of Śhrī Dattātreya.<br>
Thereafter, Macchindranāth, most have you must have heard His name, was also His Incarnation.<br>
After that Zoroaster who came three times on the Earth, He was also His Incarnation.<br>
After that Muhammad Sāhab, who was His Incarnation.<br>
And when He was asked that, "Bhāī [Brother] there must have been others also before you," then He replied, "Yes, there [was] a Muhammad." Then again He was asked who was before Him. He replied, "There was one Muhammad."</font><br>
Muhammad means Praise, the One who is praised, the One who deserves to be praised and is the One who is Redeemer of the world.<br> 
<font color="red">They were all Muhammads, they were all Dattātreyas, who came on Earth regularly.<br>
After that [was] Nāṇaka, Guru Nāṇaka. If you ever read His teachings, if you read His talks then you will be surprised that He has always talked in a Sahaja. He has said, "Sahaja Samādhi lago." He has said, "Kāhe re ban khojan jāe, Sarab nivāsī sadā alepā tohī saṃg[a] samāī, Puṣhpamadhya jo bāsa basata hai mukara māhī jaise chhāī, Taise hī harī base niraṃtara ghaṭa hī khojo bhāī." ["Why to go to forest to find Him, He is always there with you just like there is a fragrance in a flower and just as the reflection is there in a mirror, in the same way God is residing in you eternally, seek Him within."] He is just inside, achieve Him just inside. We are just singing poem, singing songs, we are just cramming His prescription.<br>
The talk of seeking this Absolute Principle, residing just inside the heart, has been made since ancient times by these Ādi Gurus, who are incarnated on this Earth again and again.</font><br>
......<br> 
<font color="red">After Nāṇak Sāhab, around fifty, sixty years ago in our Maharashtra Dattātreya incarnated as Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī.</font> If you want proof of it, then you get your Realization and after that if you put your hand on anyone, then you will get vibration of same kind: from just vibration only you can know about all.<br>
As you must have eyes to see any shape, its color, in the same way you are required to feel vibrations so that you may know all the Gurus of the world and will be able to know as who is a true guru and who is a liar, who is equal to that Incarnation of Ādi Guru Dattātreya, for mere saying there are thousands of guru in modern times. No one become guru just by saying of another. And by believing in him also, he does not become a guru."<br>

<font color="red">"When someone gets cancer, he can be cured by either Nāṇak Sāhib or Muhammad Sāhib, no one else. Because what we call Void, is known to doctors, we call it Bhavasāgar, Dattātreya, who is Ādi Guru, who helps us in crossing Bhavasāgar, where all Gurus are present, unless you take the name of one of Them, you are not going to be free from problems of Bhavasāgar, which manifests as cancer.</font> You can recognize cancer from the throb here. You cannot be cured."<br>

"But in some people that stability has to be brought about. No problem. You have obtained that thing, you recognized it, you reached there and there is a complete arrangement for bringing stability.<br>
<font color="red">As soon as that stability is achieved, in Absolute Peace and Joy, you achieve that Witness State described by Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, by Jesus, by all the Scriptures whether by Zoroaster, Socrates, Confucius or any of Dattātreya's Incarnations.</font><br>
Till today, these people who were of a higher state, who would take birth in a higher state, would talk in a manner that others were unable to understand. They could see matters of the tenth floor and others would remain on the first floor and they would just not understand what was being talked about."<br>

"Then comes the most important part of our body, is the stomach. It represents the Bhavasāgara. Is the māyā, in which we are placed.<br>
We are born in this Bhavasāgara, when Śhrī Vriṣhṇu [Viṣhṇu] Himself incarnates again and again -- you have seen as Matsya Avatāra, Kūrma Avatāra -- and He Himself leads the human beings in their evolutionary path.<br>
<font color="red">He is helped by another, another Deity, whom we call as Primordial Guru: the Ādi Guru Dattātreya.</font><br>
Śhrī Viṣhṇu rises from Bhavasāgara, and gives you the leadership to rise within yourself. He builds up your awareness, step by step, and today you are as ... as a human being.<br>
......<br>
<font color="red">Now the ... these three aspects, the essence of these aspects, or we can say the innocence of these three aspects, is combined in the Primord[i]al Guru, or the Ādi Guru Dattātreya, who resides in the Bhavasāgara and helps Śhrī Viṣhṇu for your evolution.<br>
Now He has taken many Incarnations, mainly Ten Incarnations. And these are very important, and we have to understand Them in Their full entirety.<br>
If you accept Him as Dattātreya, you have to also accept Him as Rāja Janaka.<br>
It's easy for a Hindu mind to accept Rāja Janaka, but they cannot accept Muhammad Sāhab, who was same as Rāja Janaka. It is a fact which can ... we can prove it on your Kuṇḍalinī.</font><br>
A person who is suffering from cancer of the stomach -- now this is the thing, when I say that Sahaja Yoga can cure your cancer, you have to give up certain notions that we have in our hear... head.<br>
<font color="red">A person, eh supposing he's a Hindu, and he's suffering from the stomach cancer, I have to ask him to take the name of Muhammad Sāhab. If I fail to ask him or if I convince ... do not him ... convince Him, I cannot cure his can't ... cancer. I'm sorry, I tell him, 'I just cannot do it.' But if he is a Muslim, I have to tell him: 'You have to take the name of Dattātreya.'</font><br>
Human beings, like fools, have taken away the living flowers of one tree, and now are fighting on something that is dead.<br>
<font color="red">He was Dattātreya. There is no doubt about it.</font><br>
And His daughter Fāṭimah was nobody else but Sītā Jānakī Herself.<br>
And Her two sons, Hasan and Husayn, were nobody else but Lava and Kuśha. They were born again and again: They were born as Mahāvīra and Buddha, and then They were born as Hasan and Husayn.<br>
It is only possible through Sahaja Yoga to realize that this is the Truth, this is the fact.<br>
<font color="red">He was born as Nāṇaka.</font> And Nāṇakī was nobody else but Jānakī.<br>
<font color="red">In Nāṇaka's life He has expressed it. Of course I don't know how many people have read about Nāṇak.<br>
Nāṇaka one day was sleeping, and His Feet were towards Kaaba. And people were getting vibrations from that side, so they said: "What are You doing your? Your Feet are towards Kaaba!" So He said, "All right, I'll turn My Feet's on the other side." And they started getting vibrations from the other side. They said, "What? Kaaba has moved or what?"<br>
He has, in a way, showed.<br>
'But how dare They say many things?' When They said very few thing[s], they have killed all these people and tortured Them.<br>
If you read Muhammad Sāhab['s] life, you will feel, 'What foolish people we have been, the way we have tortured [Him]!'<br>
For fanaticism the way He was killed!<br>
Actually was poisoned. He had no place where to hide His head the way people were after Him, because He was telling the Truth.<br>
And fanaticism is one thing He fought.</font><br>
So, Guru Tattwa is killed as soon as you become a fanatic person. Your Guru Tattwa is immediately finished, as soon as you take to fanaticism of any kind!"<br>

"Another thing is, here in Bhavasāgar, all Three, Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, Maheśhwar, combined to make a child, who is called Ādi Guru, is known as Dattātreya. There were many Incarnations of Him. And His Child Tattwa also took Incarnations. First was Dattātreya, then came Rāja Janak. <font color="red">Like this, many Incarnations came, Rāja Janak, Nāṇak, Zarathustra, Muhammad Sāhab, Sāī Nāth of Śhirḍī.<br>
They are all one. Are They or not? You can witness it after Self-realization. If you believe in one Guru, like Nāṇak, then you have no right not to accept Muhammad Sāhab. If you get Muhammad Sāhab and not Nāṇak, then you have no authority as well.<br>
You will be surprised, most of the cancer disease comes from the imbalance of Bhavasāgar, you follow one but not the other. Cancer also comes when we don't follow Them.<br>
Like He forbade two things, like not to smoke a cigarette and not to consume alcohol.<br>
Alcohol is entirely not allowed. Here, in Sahaja Yoga, if someone is habituated to drink alcohol, they will leave it. If they don't leave alcohol, it will [not] be in moderation because both of these things go against Guru Tattwa.<br>
If Guru Tattwa is not established within us, we cannot have our evolution. Guru Tattwa is essential. Guru Tattwa is one destiny for all religions. There is one flow from all the religions."</font><br>

"In Maharashtra, some Great Gurus have taken birth, which means we are some special people, that's what I have to say. Land of Maharashtra has something extraordinary. Or you can say that because of that soil, lotus bloomed. Those Gurus were very great.<br>
<font color="red">Before some years back we had Great Guru of Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth. No doubt about it, He was an Incarnation of Śhrī Dattātreya. There is no doubt about His Incarnation. He was a Muslim. You recognized Him, that is important.</font><br>
But there now you have built temples, big priests have come there. How they would do Pūjā for Him or worship Him? What authority they have? Who are they? And in front of them you put the money. Means, what is going on? <font color="red">What He taught, what He said?</font><br>
<font color="red">Only going to temple and sitting there, you will say, 'Sāī Bābā [of Śhirḍī] has fulfilled our wishes,' means He has done our work. He does that because He is very kind. Once you surrender to Him, He will do your work. But what you have done for Him?<br>
He is angry because you are taking His name. I have seen so many of His devotees. I have to tell Him, 'Forgive them, they don't know.' We are not qualified to take His name.<br>
He is very great, for Me.</font><br>
I am OK if you have taken My name for so many times, there is no problem. I will not get angry, I am your Mother.<br>
<font color="red">But for Him, to take His name, or to see Him with big eyes, is a big thing.</font><br>
These kinds of Great Saints we had.<br>
When they were alive, then they were tortured, that you have to accept.<br>
Now they are not here. Whatever happened it happened.<br>
But now also, how you are behaving‽ Are we behaving as per them?<br>
In Maharashtra so many Saints were there.<br>
There is one group, Śhiva Senā [Party] is created [on 1966-0619]. Some others are also created. This kind of dirty things we are doing now.<br>
<font color="red">I want to say it means what it's not a political thing, but to envy someone or think bad about others or seeing someone less than you or big than you, etc., these things should not happen by [to] devotees of Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth. Let other people do that.<br>
Keeping Sāī's Photo at home and say[ing] that, 'Hindus, Muslims are different'! That kind of thing you can't spread. Admitted that Muslims are bad that they have done something wrong or harassed someone, admitted Hindus are bad [that] they have harassed someone! But when you are keeping His Photo, where you stand? You are at His Feet.</font><br>
But if you are a disciple of anyone, fine.<br>
<font color="red">But if you are a disciple of Sāī, then you are all one. Then you don't have to have different feelings."</font><br>

"<font color="red">They are the same people! There are Ten of Them born like that. They are the same people born again and again. And They are the people, if you accept Them, in only one Incarnation, They are not going to accept it. You have to accept Them in all Their Incarnations!</font><br>
I give an example. There was a doctor who was suffering from the cancer of stomach, Muslim. He met Me in London. <font color="red">And when I told him, that, "You have to worship Dattātreya," he got a shock of his life! He said, "You mean to say I must give up my religion?" I said, "Your religion is in ... in imbalance. He was the same as Muhammad Sāhab. Actually Dattātreya incarnated as Muhammad Sāhib." He said, "I cannot do that! I only believe in Muhammad Sāhab!"</font> I said, "All right, I cannot cure your [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] ... cancer because cancer is because of imbalance. Is too much activity on one side."<br>
Overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system causes cancer. You write it down today and you can verify it. And that's why when people say I've cured cancer, I have! No doubt! Not only Me, but even this doctor who is here he has cured cancer.<br>
Cancer is only curable through the balance of Sahaja Yoga. Otherwise is not possible! Take it from Me!<br>
So the imbalance of this man, he would not listen but cancer is a vague thing that way.<br>
<font color="red">He had to come back. "All right Mother, I accept You." I said, "All right. Now will you place to ... pray to ... pray to Dattātreya?"</font><br>

"Today is the day when a Mother is being worshiped as a Guru, and is a very unique thing. So far, mostly the gurus have been men.<br>
I too has [have] a Guru, and His name is Dattātreya. And this Guru is also created by Ādi Śhakti Herself.

Now, this Guru was created when the world was created itself. Because we ... one had to create a Guru before the world was created in then Vaikuṇṭha Stage only.</font><br>
But then He reincarnated many a times.<br>
At the time of Rāma, very early, even before Rāma came into this world, much earlier than that, He was created by Satī Anusūyā. She was Herself a part of the Ādi Śhakti, who created Him out of the essences, the innocence of Brahmā, Viṣhṇu and Maheśh.<br>
There's a legend about it which I will tell you sometime.<br>
And She created Him. Actually, She created Him, so She's the Mother.<br>
But then, She becomes the Guru.<br>
When She is born as Sītā, He becomes the father. So, She ... father is Her Guru.<br>
Then, when Rāja Janaka is born as Muhammad Sāhab, then She becomes again the daughter.<br>
But when He is born as Nāṇaka, then He becomes the ... She becomes His sister.<br>
So the relationship exists and whenever He is born, She is born, in a way, that, you see, that relationship is kept a sublime relationship. I mean to say: that they are never born as husband and wife."<br>

"So the dharma that has been established in us by God Almighty because if we want to go to the Kingdom of God, then in our freedom we must desire to get to God. If someone tries to pressurize us and says, 'You must ask for God,' then it is of no use, it is not an evaluation. That is why to reach in this state, a person has to seek the God as per his own independent sweet will and not due to any pressure, or any disease or any hardships or any sorrow, but only because of the fact and realizing that, 'It is the only motive of our life to seek God.'<br>
<font color="red">That is why, when we desire for this Divine Gift, then the doors of God Almighty's Divine Blessings open for you, and around the center is a place of Ten Primordial Gurus.

Now, surrounding this you will find there is the Ocean of Illusion. <font color="red">And this Ocean of Illusion was governed by a Deity, by a special powerful personality whom we call as Dattātreya -- is the Primordial Master.

Later on, He incarnated as Muhammad Sāhab, then the same Great Principle incarnated as Nāṇaka, then the same Principle at the last incarnated as Sāī Nāth of Śhirḍī.<br>
So the same Great Principle of this Primordial Master has incarnated because without a master, how will you be taken away from in ... this illusion? How you are going to be exposed to that reality which you do not feel?</font><br>
What has to happen to you is that you have to become more sensitive, more open, awakened, enlightened to feel that's All-pervading Power around you.<br>
<font color="red">Now, these [masters] came again and again and told you that you must look after your dharma.<br>
Dharma doesn't mean any religion that is being established in the names of these people, because human beings know how to make a pickle out of everyone. They are great 'experts'.<br>
All of Them in essence are one and the same.</font><br>
But like flowers on the same tree can be taken away from time to time and then when they become ugly and they become completely spoilt, then people can claim, 'This is my flower,' 'This is my flower.' Everybody has become a contractor of this thing.<br>

Evolution could not go further in the hands of human beings who were in the bondage of ignorance, so they were given guidance through this Incarnation of the Primordial Master (Ādi Guru) again and again in different lives. He was created as the three-headed child, Dattātreya, by Ādi Śhakti who appeared on Earth during the Tretā Yuga as Satī Anasūyā, wife of the Sage Atreya. He was born as Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara] who founded Jainism -- one of the oldest religions. Then he was born as Rāja Janaka, father of Jānakī also called Sītā, Rāma's wife. She was an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti.<br>
The Primordial Master was also born as Macchindranāth, and again as Zoroaster who was worshiped by the ancient Persians, and still revered by Parsis. Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism. In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates. He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā).
