"I didn't tell you about the third kind of movement we had in our country, is of Nāth Pānthis.<br>
Jains have Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], and a deviation started from that: ah ... one guru was supposed to give knowledge to only one person. Like Janaka had only Nachiketa.<br>
Till the time of Gyāneśhwara, that's in the twelfth century.<br>
<font color="DarkRed">Gyāneśhwara was the disciple of His own brother, Nivṛuttināth. And They suffered a lot. And He asked Nivṛuttināth for one permission: that, "Let Me open the Truth to the public. Just I'll tell about it! I'll not do anything, I'll just tell about it."</font><br>
Because thirteen, fourteen thousand years back Mārkaṇḍeya has described about Kuṇḍalinī. Then came ... Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya has described about Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
But all in Sanskrit language. And Sanskrital knowledge was not available to the common public. And those who knew Sanskrit nalguage ... language didn't want to get into Self-knowledge.<br>
Thus this knowledge was kept a secret all the time."<br>

"One master would have one disciple, chosen for this.<br>
Thus, it continued till the twelfth century, when a very great poet called Gyāneśhwara, He started ...<br>
[Aside:] It's all right. [Laughs.] It's all right. [Drinks water.]<br>
He started, in a way, writing about Gītā.<br>
<font color="DarkRed">He requested His brother, who was His Guru, Nivṛittināth, that, "Please allow Me to write about Kuṇḍalinī because in the Gītā it is not mentioned. We must write about it!" So He allowed.</font><br>
And He wrote it in the sixth chapter of that Gyāneśhwarī.<br>
But people said ... the people who were in charge of the religion, that time, said: "This chapter is something to be condemned." Because they didn't know how to awaken the Kuṇḍalinī. "This has to be absolutely condemned, and nobody should read this one." Niṣhiddha is the word, is not so bad as it's condemned, but niṣhiddha: is not to be read.<br>
Thus, all this knowledge, of the inner be-ing, was kept in the darkness. And this knowledge of the inner being, not known to us, created the problem."<br>

<font color="DarkRed">But in the twelfth century, Gyāneśhwara asked His Guru, who was His brother, Nivṛittināth. He asked Him: that, ``You just allow Me to write about this Kuṇḍalinī." Because He wrote Gyāneśhwarī. And in Gyāneśhwarī, He wanted to write about this Kuṇḍalinī, just to little talk about this secret power within us. His Guru allowed Him, and then He wrote it."</font>

<font color="DarkRed">"But in the twelfth century, Gyāneśhwara took permission from His brother who was His Guru as well, that, ``Please allow Me to at least write about it! This much permission I need!" And when He wrote about it, in His book Gyāneśhwarī, in the sixth chapter, He has described beautifully that, ``Due to this Kuṇḍalinī only we achieve our enlightenment." He has stated it very clearly."</font><br>

"But in the center we had another great movement which is called as Nāth, Nāth Pānthis. They say it came from Śhiva, but whatever it is: it came from Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], and these people, and got diverted into many types.<br>
But those who remained in the middle, one of them was, we should say, was called Gahinināth. <font color="DarkRed">And his disciple was Nivṛuttināth, the elder brother of Gyānadeva.</font><br>
It is amazing, if you read anything about them, they know all about chakras, they know all about these, all three channels. Everything they new thousands of years back.<br>
Then somehow or other, they didn't tell people. They kept the knowledge to themselves.<br>
I can't say why they did it but they did.<br>
<font color="DarkRed">Ultimately, Gyānadeva took permission of His Guru, Nivṛittināth, and said that, "I, let Me tell you ... at least let Me tell others. You allow Me. Because people should know what works it out." So He wrote about Kuṇḍalinī.</font><br>
But if you read these ancient books, you will be amazed that the whole thing was described in those books: how you get your Realization, and how then we have those centers, which are to be enlightened, what problems come in.<br>
But the method they employed, [laughing:] for achieving it, was really hazardous again.<br>
I don't know why they had to do it but they did it.<br>
They were all unmarried people and very strict with themselves and they had to lead a life very secluded from the society.<br>
This was really a very difficult type of ascent they had.<br>
When I read about them I'm really is ... feel very, extremely sad, that all these great people who were seeking had to go through such horrible strenuous turmoil for days together, and then s-s-some of them got Realization."<br>
