<font color="red">"Śhrī Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya lived in sixth century A.D. He wrote many texts: Saundaryalaharī, Upadeśhasāhasri, Vivekachūḍāmaṇi, Ātmabodh, etc. In most of these texts, there are various references to Kuṇḍalinī awakening, as some of the following stanzas [10 and 9 from Saundaryalaharī] will illustrate."</font><br>
[Having in-filled in the pathway of the nāḍīs with the streaming shower of Nectar flowing from Thy pair of Feet (Lotus Feet), having resumed Thine own position from out of resplendent lunar regions, and Thyself assuming the form of a serpent of three and a half coils, sleepest Thou in the hollow of the Kulakuṇḍa.] [Kulakuṇḍa=the hollow of the Mūlādhāra -- sacrum bone.]<br>
[Thou art diverting (residing) in secrecy with Thy Lord (the Spirit) in the thousand-petalled Lotus, having pierced through the Earth situated in Mūlādhāra, the Water in the Maṇipūra, the Fire abiding in the Swādhiṣhṭhāna, the Air in the Heart (Anāhata), the Ether above (the Viśhuddhi) and Manas between the eyebrows (Āgñyā) and thus broken the entire Kula path.]<br>
<font color="red">"Śhrī Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya propounded that it is the Kuṇḍalinī who has to be awakened and unless and until you get your Realization you are nowhere near religion. Śhrī Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya also had given a very befitting answer to the so-called proponents of Haṭha Yoga, Gyān Yoga, Karma Yoga or Rāj Yoga. "Neither by Yoga, nor philosophy, nor by work, nor by learning but by the Realization of one's identity with the Brahman is liberation possible and by no other means."</font><br>

<font color="red">"So what is the pure desire? What is the want that satisfies fully? I may say that this desire is to become one with the Divine. The Divine is the love of God all might, chaitanya.[,] as described by Adi Shankaracharya Cool breez. This [i]t is the cool breez of the Holy Ghost (Adishakti), this is the Ruh described in the Holy Kuran."</font><br>

<font color="red">"Though blossom days have arrived and these are such times that many flowers are here who have potential to become fruits but there are many others around too, who would not at all accept it, would not even try to get it. As Last Judgment time has come. It's your wish to attain the Truth or leave it.<br>
Human beings can achieve a lot from this.<br>
First achievement is that we can feel this All-pervading Power (Paramachaitanya) on your fingers and very soothing, settle cool [not very cold] breeze flows from your fontanel bone area.<br>
Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya called it, "Salīlam, salīlam ..." The vibrations that flow through your hands, he called it, "Spand." "</font><br>

<p>
<font color="red">"I go to meet the big and great gurus and talk to them that, 'What are you doing?' By doing all this you cannot get God. You must understand by doing all this you will not get God.<br>
What I am saying? Read Vasiṣhṭha, or Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, because it is a historical thing. They have said the same thing that you get to God you cannot do anything. But there is a slight difference between them and Me that they had said that are very few who have the authority to get to God. Some should remain in bhakti and others should do some yogas so that they can keep their discipline. But they also said that a disciplined mind or a mind that is running after indulgences, both minds are useless for ascent. One has to have a mind like a small child which is without sin, and is innocent. Such a one has the right to attain God. This is what they have clearly said. But who reads them?<br>
The question is that we read a lot and we read about those who know nothing about dharma. And even if they know it is just a little bit.<br>
The ones who think they are very great Hindus they must first read Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya. Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya had established the Hindu Dharma. Then why not read Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya?<br>
You read all the books of the world, but why don't you read Him and know Him?<br>
The difference between what He said and I say is that He said that in crores there are just one or two and I say in crores, there are lākhs.<br>
......<br>
There is no need to fight with people who talk useless things. Those who want to come should come and those who don't want to come should not come. There is no time left to argue and have discussions with them, because such people will go on discussing and arguing.<br>
As Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya has said that low-level people should keep their minds disciplined and somehow live properly and protect themselves from becoming thieves, etc. They should live like good citizens."</font><br>

<font color="red">"But these days who reads about them? Who knows them? We go about proudly calling ourselves Hindus, and many people think that they are Hindus, meaning they are something special. But Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya who established Hinduism and its principles in this world, who worked a lot on the subject of vibrations and put forward the truth confidently before the world, who knows about it? Nobody knows anything about that. "</font><br>

<font color="red">"Very few people have written about these vibrations. And the biggest wonder is that only Śhaṅkarāchārya has written about it.<br>
But those who claim themselves to be biggest Hindus do not know Śhaṅkarāchārya.<br>
Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya has talked of nothing but Sahaja Yoga.<br>
He had just said, "Na Sāṅkhyen na Yogen"</font> [an inversion of the first part of line 1 of Vivekachūḍāmaṇi 56], <font color="red">"God is not achieved either by Sāṅkhya or Yoga," He is achieved in a sahaja way, spontaneously. The growth is spontaneous and He [God] had not made any caste.<br>
He [Śhī Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya] had said that, 'There were three kind of people in the world, the one who of lower level, those who do not have much intelligence. Those who have not yet developed fully as a human being.'<br>
......<br>
Now the only difference between him [Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya] and Me is that He used to say there that there is one in millions and I say that there are thousands in millions. This is the only difference between both of us.<br>
It may be possible that there used to be such people in sixth century but as of today I see there are thousands of them who are getting this thing."</font><br>

<font color="red">"This quality could be found in great people like Christ, Lord Kṛiṣhṇa and other great Saints. It could be found in Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya.

<font color="red">"Those who get their Self-realization and are equipped with this power, they never have to face any disease. And even if it comes they can cure it, because they are given the knowledge as to how to cure which disease and how.<br>
This energy, spiritual awareness flowing in your hands, as these has been called even by Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya in his books.<br>
But no one is reading those books any more these days."</font><br>

<font color="red">"And the sly one, talks lies, is a fraud and cunning, and never be dhārmik.<br>
And that's why our dharma, the dharma of the whole world is distorted.<br>
Nobody would believe now that Hindu Dharma, was taken to such an epitome by Saints like Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, who was highly realized, where it has been now degraded.<br>
Where is Muhammad Sāhab and what is His religion now? Where Jesus Christ and what His religion is now? I can't see how people are walking blindly in the wrong directions.<br>
......<br>
Meaning is, I say on behalf of Muhammad Sāhab, 'Is this the religion of Muslims?' On behalf of Īsā Masīh, 'Is this Christian religion?' And on behalf of Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, I ask, 'Is this Hindu religion?' Which are based on myths.<br>
And the one who said, "The whole world is a big myth," Śhrī Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, has been falsified by these people.<br>
He is residing in this Āgñyā chakra."</font><br>

<font color="red">"You cannot seek God through any other Yoga. 

I bow to Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, who is the eldest Son of our country: He is very big man of our country. Although, Hindu religion is very much degraded and we just could not understood what Hindu religion is all about. Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya has clearly said, "Na Sāṅkhyen na Yogen" [an inversion of the first part of line 1 of Vivekachūḍāmaṇi 56], "God can't be achieved by anything." And He also has said that there are three types of people.<br>
First types of persons are those who seek God in devotion, they do not have intelligence. They do not understand they have not yet established a connection, then how they can talk to God? They cram like mad, shouts like mad and die after getting mad. But I would have no objection if it would have stopped just here, sometimes in this madness a man gets connected to Paralok [Collective Subconscious] and bhūt vidyā, etc. enters in him. It may happen.<br>
Second type of person is a person with very sharp intelligence, very intelligent, but he has very unstable mind. He runs here and there, run this way and that way. So such a person thinks of yoga practice, so that one can control mind. This is also very wrong attitude. You cannot reach there by controlling mind. So that person controls the mind, thinks that by controlling he will reach [there]. Such disciplined mind, such mind cannot take you to God, the car in which brakes are applied cannot take you there.<br>
But from this it should not be understood that the one who is indulgent or is very voluptuous, he can reach God. He can never reach to God. But the person who leaves all these things to think that, 'I have to seek that,' and he disciplines himself too much in the name of religion, he also does not reach.<br>
Actually, we have to become, we have to just become."</font><br>

<font color="red">"The roots of Tantrism are as ancient as the awareness of religion, but it came into full force during the years 900 -- 1400 A.D. Following the Advent of Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, the great Hindu reforming Saint, or even earlier under the Emperor Aśhoka, anti-religious forces built up in India as a reaction to extreme asceticism. Jainism had reached its spiritual height through the achievements of very few adherents, and was embraced by many government ministers. They created a sense of artificial and outwardly austere asceticism. The kings, feeling oppressed by this extremely unnatural lifestyle, gave royal support to Tantrism. Later on, many other Court officials also played a great role in creating the necessary atmosphere for Tantrism's rapid spread. In retrospect, by the 6th century, absurd monastic ways of life in the three official religions, Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, made people colorless and stereotypical. Ironically, all the three religions believed in the middle Path of Righteousness. "</font><br>

<font color="red">"Most of the seekers that I met during that time told me that, although they knew they were looking for something, they were completely ignorant of what it was and had been mesmerized by these negative and false teachers. I have to say that it is truly lamentable the way earnest seekers have been exploited by these horrible so-called gurus from India. For seekers are a special category of people and, as such, they are very precious. William Blake describes them as "men of God". They are the ones who have been seeking in many lifetimes to find the Divine and have often become lost in the web of words of false ideas ("śhabda jālam" in Sanskrit, as described by Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya)."</font><br>

<font color="red">"We had a Saint called Mārkaṇḍeya, who they say lived fourteen thousand years ago. He has written about this fourth dimension and has described it as the blessing of the Primordial Mother. The second person who was very well equipped with this knowledge, was Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya who has written many books. The first book he wrote was Vivekachūḍāmaṇi, in which he describes this fourth dimension and explains why we should try to attain this fourth dimension. An intellectual, one Mister Sharma, challenged him and told him that he could not do anything as an ascetic and win over my intellect. Thus he felt that for the common people all this discussion might just seem to be mental acrobatics. So he decided to write books just praising the Primordial Mother, especially in Saundaryalaharī, where he described all the Divine Vibrations as the vibrations of the loving beauty of the Primordial Mother. At that time all this was written in the Sanskrit language but the common people did not understand this language, except for a very few learned people, who also did not want to go into the details of this exposition."</font><br>
