"About Me also you can ask questions. There are many ways of recognizing because in this life, you have to recognize. You have never recognized an Incarnation so far. You have to recognize.<br>
That is compulsory and that is done through Sahajs Yoga because unless and until you are realized, how are [you] going to recognize Them also?<br>
But even if you have not recognized Them, there was no need for you to crucify Them or to torture.<br>
<font color="red">Then all the Gurus who came on this Earth, the Real Ones -- fakes are never gurus, they are not gurus -- the Real Ones that came on this Earth, say, we can say Moses, Abraham, Nāṇak, Muhammad Sāhib, Kabīr, all these are Incarnations of Primordial Master whom we call as Dattātreya.</font><br>
If They are or not, if Muhammad Sāhib and Guru Nāṇak are the same personality, same people who came in different times, then what justice are we doing to Them? How are we to find out? How are you to believe Me about it?"<br>

"So, if you think evolution is a religion, then I would say Sahaja Yoga is the religion. If your evolution if you call it as a religion, then Sahaja Yoga is a religion. But is a religion which takes you belo ... beyond your sustenance, beyond your religion, dharmātīt, beyond the dharma.<br>
We have amongst ourselves Hindu[s], Muslims, Christians, all kinds of people, you know that. All these people can feel it within themselves: is the religion in their stomachs, they can feel it. They can find out where is the religion. Because, I say, there, religion in the stomach is looked after by the Deities of Primordial Master whom we call as Dattātreya, in the Sanskrit language.<br>
But does't mean Hinduism. It doesn't mean Hinduism at all. But it is called as Dattātreya in the Sanskrit language, in English is Primordial Master.<br>
<font color="red">He is the same who incarnated on this earth: as Moses, as Abraham, and, say, incarnated as Muhammad Sāhab, as Rāja Janaka, as Nāṇaka, and also as Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth.</font> Can you believe that Muhammad Sāhab is the same as our Nāṇak?"<br>

"<font color="red">And when it is worked out with effort, many Gurus and many -- Real Ones, I'm saying, not, I'm not talking of the horrid ones -- but the Real Ones who have been working in the forest, and the great people like Moses, and Abraham and all these people, They knew how difficult it was to raise the Kuṇḍalinī, this coiled thing: gradually, one after another.</font><br>
And the detailed description of this is so horrifying that people get a fright.<br>
Actually when the Kuṇḍalinī rises, normally, by effort of people who are authorized to do it, is such a slow movement that at any center where there is any escape, any weakness, the attention immediately goes on the sides from the cause, from the center. Once it moves to the center, you start getting all kinds of visions."</font><br>

"But still, as you can see in the life of Christ, that coming of Christ was declared much before Christ came in by the Prophets who made prophecies. All these Prophets belong to the category of the Gurus I am talking about.<br>
So, all over the world three types of movements were on. For example, the scientist[s] on the right-hand side, we can say, and the left-hand side are the devotees of God who sing the praise of God. <font color="red">And in the center there were people like Moses, like Abraham, who came on this earth just to prophesize, just to protect the devotees of God.</font><br>
Now this middle movement of evolution, today, has reached its peak. Because all the Incarnations have arrived now, and have done Their job within you. They have occupied Their position within you, in your awareness, on these different centers. <br>
......<br>
So today we are here to know that within us all these Incarnations exist, and the force that really brought forth, really manifested, who live like human beings and work like Gurus, that force which existed in this area, which created religion within us.<br>
Religion, as we understand, organized religion, is not the religion. But the religion means: your sustaining power. You are a human being because there are ten sustaining powers within you.<br>
So, They came to sustain us and to give us full idea about these Ten Powers and to establish us in our religion as a human being.<br>
So these Gurus, who lived in that area, worked out the sustainace [sustenance] and helped us.<br>
And this is one of the greatest forces we have got, which resides within us.<br>
And whatever They have said has a very great meaning.<br>
Actually, we should say the Main Gurus are ten, but there are many other Gurus.<br>
<font color="red">And these Ten Gurus could be described as Rāja Janaka, then Moses, Abraham, and the in modern times you can say Muhammad Sāhab, and even up to Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth, in Śhirḍī, that force came in, for a short time, and then He disappeared. Nobody knows how He came there, He lived there and He died.</font> Also, if you know Nāṇaka, He was also the same force, the same Primordial Master, who was born on this Earth.<br>
Now, this is not the time to tell about individual people. But, I think, one day I will talk to you only on this subject of the Gurus.<br>
So, these Gurus first started under the Primordial Master Himself, He was called as Dattātreya."<br>

"The thing that really gives you the balance is the sustainance [sustenance], is the sustainance [sustenance], dharma. If you do not have that, then you could go, shoot off like a pendulum from this side to that.<br>
But in dharma also there could be a problem, and that is one of the worst possible, is of fanaticism. So, I mean, if you try to make the dharma a fanatic idea.<br>
<font color="red">Like none of these Incarnations, like Muhammad Sāhab who was a[n] Incarnation of the Primordial Master, and all others like Him, Moses, Abraham, any One of Them who came on this Earth, ever thought of fanaticism. Never they realized, that when they told, 'Don't do this,' 'Don't do that,' some sort of people will take up upon themselves that, 'We are the chosen ones. We are the great.' I mean, this They could never understood. And whenever They found it was happening again They took birth. Again They took birth to tell people: 'This is not dharma.'</font><br>
To form any kind of a cult or an organization and religion is against God! Is blasphemous!<br>
How can you organize God? You cannot."</font><br>

"Now when They said, "Don't drink," you say, 'Oh-oh, that's out-of-dated. You see, there's Muhammad Sāhab, was no good. He told us not to drink.' Nāṇaka said, "Don't drink."<br>
Now, smoking, you see the results of smoking, now what's happening with smoking. It goes against uh uh your Viśhuddhi. Because, you see, that is the place of Kṛiṣhṇa, and smoking started much later. You see, when He was much earlier, smoking started later on.<br>
That's why Nāṇak Sāhab has talked about it much more.<br>
But uh Muhammad Sāhab did see this point, He did see. So He said, "All ... all the inter... intoxicants and all habits are to be discarded. All such things must be discarded." So, He also wanted mhh yeah ...<br>
...... [Conversation to identify the English word addiction.]<br>
All these addictions must be given up. He said it, very clearly: "No addictions are allowed," according to Him.<br>
But you see, how you make uh-uh-uh uh-uh fuss about things.<br>
Like Muhammad Sāhab and all these Gurus, all these Great Incarnations of the Primordial Master who was Ādi Dattātreya, Ādinātha [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], They taught you how to maintain your religion, your sustainance [sustenance], your balance.<br>
So, immediately the Christians. <font color="red">Because Christ didn't talk much about it because Moses had talked about it, Abraham had talked about it.</font> So Christ did not talk, so they said, "All right. So Christians can drink." Just imagine.<br>
This is a loophole.<br>
That's how they became Christians perhaps. Because they thought that if ... uh they were belonged to the Jews, you see, then they would have ... uh they wouldn't be able to drink.<br>
But Jews drink like Hell. Jews also drink now! I mean the Muslims drink the most, you see.<br>
And worst are the Sikhs: who are prohibited from drinking and smoking, they can beat all your scotch people here, you see. All your scotch whiskey goes into their stomachs [laughter], all these things, and they grow in this, this  beard, thinking that they are great Sikhs going around, you see."<br>

"Around that, is that area where actually it exists in the stomach of God, we can say, this is the Bhavasāgara. This is what we have to cross. You see there's a Void, from there to there is a Void, and this we have to cross. And this is the thing which is crossed by the Kuṇḍalinī awakening.<br>
<font color="red">Now what happens? That around that uh ... that ... water-like thing that you see there, see that is the one where Ten ... the Primordial Masters were born, Gurus, Primordial Gurus. Now They were incarnated of innocence of all this three aspects. And They were incarnated on this Earth, say, from Abraham, Moses, then we had uh-uh-uh ... up to Muhammad Sāhab we can say, then we can say Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth, then Nāṇaka, Janaka, all these people incarnated as Gurus.</font><br>
Now what do They do? They, They, They give you sustainance [sustenance]. They give you sustainance [sustenance].<br>
Now, sustenance is ... is ... for human beings is different. For animals is different."<br>

"And when the Kuṇḍalinī rises, She awakens all these Deities.<br>
For example, Muhammad Sāhab is in the Void. All the Guru's like Muhammad Sāhab, all the Prophets, are in the Void, here, in the stomach.<br>
Because, you see, these people have not arrived I haven't got My map [Chakra Chart] here but they might, could be arriving any time, then we can have a look at it.<br>
And like these centers that are here, we have all these Deities, these Leaders who came to save us, on this Earth. We call it in Sanskrit Daśhāvatāras [Ten Incarnations].<br> 
<font color="red">And then we have so many Prophets like Muhammad Sāhab and like Moses, Abraham. All these are Great Prophets. They are all settled within ourselves here.<br>
You will be amazed that They are in a dormant condition.<br>
When this Kuṇḍalinī rises upward, She gives power to all of Them, and They start working. And then They open out here on the head, on top.</font>"<br>

"When Śhrī Rām came, people said that they accepted Paraśhurām, when Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa came they said, they accepted Śhrī Rām, and at the time of Śhrī Nāṇaka, they accepted Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. <font color="red">When Christ was here they accepted Abraham.</font><br>
All of Them had taken human form. But it is all the play of buddhi: how interesting it is!<br>
Now, I have come and people are accepting Śhrī Sāī Nāth.<br>
But when He lived here, He did not even get anything to eat. Why was it so? He was also a human being. As long as He was alive, He too was considered useless and tortured. But when He died, He was regarded as Bhagavān.<br>
What is the reason of this all? Why has man been like this?<br>
You will have water of the Ganges, where She flows. If She is flowing here, will you say, 'We do not accept Her as the Ganges!'? There may be nothing at the place where She was flowing earlier, or maybe only a nullah [ravine] at present. If you want to take it as the Ganges, you go your way. If the Ganges is flowing at this place, why not accept it?<br>
It is not easy to understand human intellect. It is the most difficult job in the world! It is easy to understand God, because He is what He is. He does not have such double dealings. Man has a variety of qualities, not just double. All animals from snakes and scorpions to elephants, horses and lions are residing in him. You will not understand at all, why his brain is working in this way.<br>
Now when the Ganges is flowing why don't you take water from Her?<br>
Imagine this plug has been connected here. Will you connect in its place a plug which is out of order? It is quite pragmatic.<br>
I cannot understand what hallucination is there on human intellect, that he does not accept the Truth which he is seeing but accepts something that is not seen?
Its reason was understood long back and that is ahaṅkār [ego]. Man has too much of ego.<br>
If you had accepted Śhrī Rāma in His days, He would have told you to get your Kuṇḍalinī awakened and get the Realization and get established in Sahaja Yoga.<br>
Had you recognized Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, He would not have played Sahaja Yoga in Gokul, but would have given you the Realization and told you to practice Sahaja Yoga.<br>
If Śhrī Nāṇak had been accepted, there was no need for Him to break His head telling you to do different things. He would have simply taught Sahaja Yoga, but very few understood Him in His days.<br>
Now, when He is not here, you have built gurudwārās in His name.<br>
When Muhammad is not here mosques have been made, because they think now Muhammad Sāhib is in their hands.<br>
Now Rāma is in their hands, and they can make His temple and say, 'His is our temple, this Rāma is our property. We have authority over Him and whatever you have brought, all money and other things, offer them to this idol.'<br>
You say all this because you think you are the authority of this idol. It is sheer ego because of which man thinks, that he can keep God in his control and for that he is making all the show. Every time the same show was repeated."<br>

"What it is remarkable to see, that before this, no Incarnation said publicly, that, They were Incarnations.<br>
Rāma, of course, had forgotten that He was an incarnation. In a way, He was ... He made Himself to forget, played His māyā upon Himself, to become a complete human be-ing, Maryādā Puruṣhottama.<br>
And Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa also only told one person, Arjuna, just before he was to start the war.<br>
<font color="red">Abraham never said that He was the Incarnation, though He was the Incarnation of Primordial Master.</font><br>
Dattātreya Himself never said that He was the Incarnation of the Primordial Master. With all these three forces, acting through innocence, [He] came on this Earth to guide.<br>
Moses never said that, though they knew He was great. He had overpowered nature. But He never said that He was the Incarnation."<br>

"The Primordial Master was also born as Macchindranāth, and again as Zoroaster who was worshiped by the ancient Persians, and still revered by Parsis. <font color="red">Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism.</font> In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates. He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā). Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918. Altogether there were ten major Avatāras of Dattātreya."<br>

"Actually Hazarat Muhammad never made Islam an exclusive religion in the Qur'ān. <font color="red">He very respectfully talked about Moses, Abraham, Christ and His Mother, one after another.</font> Even so Muslims believe they are exclusive. Jews and Christians also believe theirs are exclusive religions. There is another problem -- they believe that Muhammad was the exclusive messenger of God and Christians believe that Christ is the last word, while Jews believe that their Savior has yet to come. If these Incarnations were the last ones why did Muhammad say, "I will send you the Twelfth Mahdī?" Also why did Christ say that He would send the Holy Ghost? We cannot say how long the Jews are going to wait for their Savior to come. They are wailing and crying before the wailing wall wearing the Torah in small amulets, but actually the most important thing for them is to collect the money that they have lent and buy diamonds at any cost."<br>

"For example, the war in Bosnia is the misidentification of Croats, Muslims and Serbs. They follow the Christian and Muslim religions. The Croats are Catholic Christians but do they follow Christ? What about Muslims who believe in the Formless God and despite this fight for land? Actually, Muhammad never talked of an exclusive religion. <font color="red">He talked about Abraham, Moses and Christ in a series and the fourth was Himself. Even Christ talked about Abraham and Moses.</font> Why do people who follow Moses, Christ or Muhammad fight? They have the same roots. At least these three religions should produce people who understand the oneness of their religions. Of course, the Hindu religion is not exclusive. It accepts all the religions but even Hindus in charge of religious affairs have made different laws for different religions. They are taking advantage of the minorities for votes in the Democracy."<br>

"In Japan we had another great Master whose name was Viditama. He was the disciple of Lord Buddha and he went to Japan and started the Zen system. Zen means meditation -- dhyāna -- and he wanted people to become "thoughtlessly aware". He found out many ways of making people "thoughtlessly aware" -- the tea ceremony and the temples that they have, are all meant to create thoughtless awareness. I was amazed that none of the Japanese knew what the purpose of these gardens were. There is one garden which has some moss on top of a hill in a very small area and it is very interesting. You have to see the flowers and other foliage there through a magnifying glass. All this should amaze a person and one should become thoughtlessly aware. That was the idea of Zen, but surprisingly, few understood Zen. Then there was a Prophet, Zoroaster, who was born five times in His country, Persia. Ultimately Muhammad Sāhib had to come to say something very clearly about religion. But the people who followed Muhammad Sāhib, never realized the oneness of His preaching or that of Zoroaster, and they made all the Persians run away to all the other countries and so many of them came to India.<br>
<font color="red">Muhammad Sāhib has talked about Abraham, Moses, Christ in a series as They came one after the other.</font> He has talked about the Mother of Christ especially with great respect. In the Bible She is not given so much respect because of Paul who edited the Bible. She is just called "the woman". But Prophet Muhammad says that anyone who talks against this Holy Lady will be punished, or something to that effect. So one can see that Muhammad Sāhib never talked of an exclusive religion called "Islam" (i.e., I surrender to God Almighty). But so many followers of Islam are fighting the followers of other religions and even amongst themselves."<br>

"As the Kuṇḍalinī rises into the third part, next to the Nābhī chakra, we become absolutely righteous. This area, which we call as the Ocean of Illusion, is enlightened by Ten Principles of Mastery. The Great Masters have created these ten centers of commandments which are enlightened and we become holy. There is no need to be strict in one's behavior. We automatically become really spiritual. Like an egg becomes the bird, we are born twice. In Sanskrit a Yogi or the one who knows Brahma, meaning the All-pervading Power, is called dvija and a bird is also called dvija, meaning twice-born. <font color="red">There were Abraham and Moses and all the Ten Primordial Masters who have been born again and again on this Earth.</font> Zoroaster has been born five times and also so many of these were born in different places in different countries to guide the people to take to religious life to establish the necessary balance for the ascent."<br>
