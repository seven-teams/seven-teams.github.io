<b>Variant 1:</b>
"<font color="red">But some people are also strange, such as one lady has come and said, "I believe in [worship] Reṇukā Devī." Now, particularly, we should not believe in [worship] Reṇukā Devī's Incarnation.</font><br>
And people believe in these kind of insane things. Some people simply believe in who we believe as Incarnations."<br>
<br>
<b>Variant 2:</b>
"Now, there was one lady who said, "Mother, I worship Reṇukā Devī," so, you should not consider Reṇukā Devī as an Incarnation specifically.<br>
People do many such things but normally if you ask about the very well-known Incarnations, this will happen immediately."<br>

<font color="red">"In Maharashtra there are Aṣhṭavināyak, then we have Three Goddesses, that is, Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī, Śhrī Mahāsaraswatī and Śhrī Mahākālī, I don't have to tell you, though all of this is there.

"Same is the situation of Hindu religion. In Hindu religion, there are different Real Gurus, for example Śhrī Ādi Guru Dattātreya, the Nāth Pānth. There are different Incarnations and different swayambhus. They have different religious books.<br>
But in Christian religion, they have only Bible. They can be fundamentalists. Muslims and Jews can be fundamentalists. All these are interrelated. 'This is written in the Books.'<br>
But this is not the case of Hinduism. <font color="red">When one is worshiping Mahālakṣhmī, the other is worshiping Reṇukā Devī.</font> So each family is different. They believe in Incarnations and books."<br>
