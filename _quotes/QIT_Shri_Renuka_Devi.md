<b>Variant 1:</b><br>
"<font color="red">But some people are also strange, such as one lady has come and said, "I believe in [worship] Reṇukā Devī." Now, particularly, we should not believe in [worship] Reṇukā Devī's Incarnation.</font><br>
And people believe in these kind of insane things. Some people simply believe in who we believe as Incarnations."<br>
<b>Variant 2:</b><br>
"<font color="red">Now, there was one lady who said, "Mother, I worship Reṇukā Devī," so, you should not consider Reṇukā Devī as an Incarnation specifically.</font><br>
People do many such things but normally if you ask about the very well-known Incarnations, this will happen immediately."<br>

<font color="red">"Now the second one [of the three and a half energies] is Mahāsaraswatī, is at Māhūra Gaḍa -- we always sing 'Māhūra Gaḍāvarī' song, that is the one -- is Mahāsaraswatī, which is ... also called as Reṇukā Devī. That's the right-sided Mahāsaraswatī."</font><br>

"In Maharashtra there are Aṣhṭavināyak, then we have Three Goddesses, that is, Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī, Śhrī Mahāsaraswatī and Śhrī Mahākālī, I don't have to tell you, though all of this is there. <font color="red">Still we remember Jejurīchā Khaṇḍobā [Khaṇḍobā of Jejurī or Mārtāṇḍa Bhairava, most popular family Deity in Maharashtra], then we remember Reṇukā Devī.</font><br>

<b>Variant 1:</b><br>
"Same is the situation of Hindu religion. In Hindu religion, there are different Real Gurus, for example Śhrī Ādi Guru Dattātreya, the Nāth Pānth. There are different Incarnations and different swayambhus. They have different religious books.<br>
But in Christian religion, they have only Bible. They can be fundamentalists. Muslims and Jews can be fundamentalists. All these are interrelated. 'This is written in the Books.'<br>
But this is not the case of Hinduism. <font color="red">When one is worshiping Mahālakṣhmī, the other is worshiping Reṇukā Devī.</font> So each family is different. They believe in Incarnations and books."<br>
<b>Variant 2:</b><br>
The same is the case with Hindu religion. In Hindu religion you cannot be communal at all. Because your various Gurus, Real Gurus like Dattātreya, etc., and Nāth Pānthis, are your many Incarnations and your swayambhus are many. You don't have one book. You have [a] number of books.<br>
Only Jesus and Bible, they can be fundamentalists. And they can be Yahūdīs [Jews] also. And all the three are related to each other. It is written in Books.<br>
But a Hindu can never be communal. Because some have some guru and others a different guru. <font color="red">Some adore Mahālakṣhmī, others Reṇukā Devī, some to Kṛiṣhṇa.</font> So, every person, every family individually adore [some] Incarnation, books. As such there is no book which can be called as Holy Bible.<br>
