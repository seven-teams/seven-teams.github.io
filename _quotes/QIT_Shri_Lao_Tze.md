[<b>Page 281:</b>] [To an acupuncturist follower of Śhrī Lao Tze who became aggressive when Śhrī Mātājī moved Her hand around His aura:] "<font color="red">How can you telephone with a disconnected line? You cannot follow Tao. You have to become Tao. You have to be realized otherwise all spiritual practices and gestures are tomfooleries. All your acupuncture will just activate the sympathetic nervous system. If you try to handle your machinery without establishing the connection with the source of its power, the parasympathetic system, you will spoil it. When Lao Tze was alive, how many believed in Him and how many opposed Him? Why do you believe in Lao Tze? Because He is no more and you can handle Him instead of Him handling you. Once He is dead you are using Him and following dead rituals. Today, Lao Tze is dead and Mātājī is living.</font> So many people feel the Divine Breeze in their fingers. My child, how long are you going to cheat yourself? Why not know your own powers?"<br>

<font color="red">"These brief reviews [stanzas from Śhrī Guru Granth Sāhib] illustrate that the theme of Kuṇḍalinī awakening referred to variously as Rebirth, Resurrection, [True] Baptism, Union with Divine, Tao [of Lao Tze], is common throughout mankind's history in all the religions of the world. In fact, this is the essence of all the religions, though because of time and place constraints, it was kept a hidden science in the past."</font><br>

"<font color="red">You see, uh acupuncture or all these uh-uh-uh systems are started by ... uh in the Wes... in the Chinese uh, this thing, there was a very great Sahaja Yogi was Lao Tze. He started acupuncture actually. And He has described Self-realization in [a] very clear way, absolute clear way. And He has said that, "Nobody who is not a self-realized should do acupuncture at all." He has prohibited it completely for people who are not realized Souls. But everybody is doing it, which is a wrong thing.</font><br>

Just they don't have it. They have other teas and this and that and they use certain roots, I am more Ayurvedic style, but not, acupuncture they don't have.<br>
<font color="red">I have been in China Myself. They, I asked Him about it [asked about Him]. They said, "Lao Tze! Useless fellow," [some laughter] like that.</font><br>
<font color="red">You see, because after Lao Tze very few people got Realization.</font><br> 
And this one has to know what are the centers in the hand, where they are. They are also using all wrong points, all sympathetic points. They are not using the right points, which are the parasympathetic.<br>

"Now, all the Gurus, all the Gurus who came, say from ... we can start from Socrates, then Abraham, Moses, this is the Guru Tattwa, is the Principle of Master, Primordial Masters. The Principle is born again and again. In India we can say the Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], we had one Ādināth, the Guru long time back. Then we had Dattātreya, we had uh Janaka, Nāṇaka, Sāī Nāth.<br>
<font color="red">We had in the Middle East Muhammad Sāhab, Lao Tze in China, Confucius.</font><br> 
<font color="red">All these Great Principles of Gurus who were born, They had one job to do is to establish your dharma. Their job was not to give you Realization.</font><br>
You must understand: everyone has one's own job.</font><br> 
See, Mine is a horrible job [laughing:] because I have to do everybody's jobs.<br>
<font color="red">But Their job was just to establish your dharma. They came at that time in those places where it was needed the most.<br>
So, these Ten Principles, as I told you, They established [dharma].</font><br> 
<font color="red">They are created in the Void.</font><br>
As you see here the Void part, this part is made out of the water element. <font color="red">So, whatever miracles They did, had something to do with water, like They could create water anywhere They wanted to. They would not cure people. All of Them have created water in the desert or in the places where ... like in ... Nāṇaka has created a Pan̄jā Sāhab they call it, or everywhere They have been able to create water. Whatever They touched, They could create water out of it.</font><br>
Water is the life, life force which sustains us. Without water we cannot live! The is the sustainance [sustenance].<br>
<font color="red">But, They actually are symbolized in an ocean, in the ocean, because They give us the salt, the salt of life, which gives us the sustainance [sustenance].</font> If you see the salt, if we do not have salt in our body, we'll have no sustainance [sustenance]."<br>

"People very religiously sit down and discuss God. It's most surprising for Me.<br>
You have to become. It's an actualization. It's a Real Baptism you must have. It is your right to have it! You are seeking that alone and nothing else! You have to get it within yourself! If you cannot get it, then you are not going to be a happy person.<br>
Don't run after falsehood. Ask for the Reality. And the Reality is that: the Spirit resides within your heart.<br>
You don't have to travel for that.<br>

"[Pointing down from Viśhuddhi chakra to Nābhī chakra on the Chakra Chart:] The connection is that this seeking [slowly makes three and a half clockwise circles inside the Void around the Nābhī chakra on the Chakra Chart:] goes in developing and there are Ten Principles which are described as the Ten Commandments, you can say, or we have got Ten Sūtras is, in Sanskrit language they are called as Ten Sūtras.<br>
Gāndhījī [laughing:] put one more, by saying that, 'We should use only Indian ... Indian things, not foreign things, because then they will dominate us.' So he put ekādeśha [ekādaśha=eleven], he put one more.<br>
But there are Ten, which are here, which are described as [the] Ten Commandments in the Bible.<br>
<font color="red">And [doing a clockwise bandhan from right top to bottom and to left top inside the Void on the Chakra Chart:] these are the Ten Primordial Masters who were born on this Earth. Say we can start from Socrates, then we can think of other, in India was Dattātreya, is the ... Dattātreya is the essence, and He is born as Socrates, He is born as Lao Tze, He is born as Abraham, as Moses, He is born as, up till now we can say, Muhammad Sāhab, Nāṇaka, latest is the Sāī Nāth of Śhirḍī.</font> He is the One who [pointing with one more circle inside the Void on the Chakra Chart:] represents, They all represent, this Primordial Master's Principle of Religion."<br>

Transformation doesn't mean that you are sitting like a normal person, you start jumping like a mad man. It doesn't mean that. That you don't become mad, that's one thing one should know."<br>

"Today I would like to say about this chakra especially that is the ... what we call the Nābhī chakra, is the central path of our evolution where you start your seeking and youge [you] cross over to [the] other side.<br>
Now, surrounding this you will find there is the Ocean of Illusion. And this Ocean of Illusion was governed by a Deity, by a special powerful personality whom we call as Dattātreya -- is the Primordial Master. And He incarnated on this Earth many a times. <font color="red">At the time of Christ, and even before that, He incarnated as, say, Abraham, Moses, Socrates, Lao Tze.</font> Later on, He incarnated as Muhammad Sāhab, then the same Great Principle incarnated as Nāṇaka, then the same Principle at the last incarnated as Sāī Nāth of Śhirḍī.<br>
So the same Great Principle of this Primordial Master has incarnated because without a master, how will you be taken away from in ... this illusion? How you are going to be exposed to that reality which you do not feel?<br>
What has to happen to you is that you have to become more sensitive, more open, awakened, enlightened to feel that's All-pervading Power around you.<br>
Now, these [masters] came again and again and told you that you must look after your dharma.<br>
Dharma doesn't mean any religion that is being established in the names of these people, because human beings know how to make a pickle out of everyone. They are great 'experts'.<br>
All of Them in essence are one and the same.<br>
But like flowers on the same tree can be taken away from time to time and then when they become ugly and they become completely spoilt, then people can claim, 'This is my flower,' 'This is my flower.' Everybody has become a contractor of this thing.<br>
Actually these people belong to the whole universe, They are universal beings and They came on this Earth to give us a sustainance [sustenance] within us, a sustainance [sustenance].<br>
Dharma means a sustainance [sustenance], that is we can say, that is quality that is ... that is human."<br>

"And that's what one has to do: is to place yourself in such a way, 'Let us see.' Keep your minds open to see: what is the Truth about yourself.<br>

"So, to uh establish the balance within us, these people came again and again, these Ten Primordial Beings we saw: some on the left-hand side, some on the right-hand side. It's very symbolic. The whole thing is so wonderful.<br>
<font color="red">So now we can say who They were. From the very beginning, this is Socrates, Moses, Abraham, Lao Tze, we had Muhammad, Nāṇak, Janak, and the last of all was Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth.</font> Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth: the one who lived in Śhirḍī. He is the last Incarnation who came. After Muhammad Nāṇaka came, after Nāṇaka Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth.<br>
All these are the one and the only ... only one Principle of Primordial Master who came, and They all said the same thing.<br>
First of all, They were against alcohols, against any kind of a[n] intoxication.<br>
But say, at the time of Moses they didn't have cigarettes, you see, so He didn't say about cigarettes, naturally. They didn't have. So the people who follow Moses think, 'There's nothing wrong with cigarettes because He didn't say.' But that time there were no cigarettes, you see?<br>
All these sinful things were devised afterwards."<br>

"Though this Incarnation is such that It never dies. Even if They leave the body, They are always around. And They are the Ones who perform lots of miracles when any other Incarnation comes on this Earth. They help, support, guide that seekers to go to the Incarnations.<br>
So, to celebrate His [Śhrī Guru Nāṇaka's] birthday, on such a date, is also a myth because He never died. He is eternally living: They never grow and They never die.<br>
<font color="red">But His birth is important, because, symbolically, He came on this Earth not to propagate any particular type of the Void as Muhammad did, or, say, Moses did, David, Moses and then, before that Abraham, Lao Tze, or Socrates, which followed into a religion.</font> But He came to create amenity, amity we can say, to create understanding, to create unity between the religions. This was a very big step for Sahaja Yoga.<br>
After that as you know, He was born again, God knows where, no one knows where He was born, but He appeared as Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth. He too said the same thing: that, 'To talk ill of any religion is a sin.' 
......<br>
So, try to gather nourishment.

And later on, in the uh form of uh Muhammad Sāhab. And then Janaka. No, no, Nāṇaka, I'm sorry, Nāṇaka. Nāṇak Sāhab. And in Greece, it was Socrates. They took birth on all these places. In the end, about fifty years back, or hundred years back, was born Great Primordial Master, in India, in Śhirḍī.<br>

Also it creates two institutions within you, as ego and superego, which cross over at this point [shows Āgñyā]. The right one passes like this, and crosses over and covers all this area in front [shows the left side and the front of Her head]. And the another one crosses over from the left side and covers this area [shows the right side and the back of Her head]. <font color="red">So you have these two things described in the Chinese style of uh Lao Tze's uh, say in religion.</font> These are the two institutions of Ha and Ṭha, two sympathetic nervous systems: one creating ego and another creating superego as a byproduct."<br>

"Now whatever Arneau has told you, or  whatever I am going to tell you, is the knowledge of the roots, which was kept secret for thousands of years. And first time in the sixth century people started talking openly about it and telling: what are we inside ourselves.<br>
But all the Great Incarnations who came in this tradition of spirituality, one by one manifested, every time, a new awareness in the human dimension.<br>
In the ancient time when they followed Patañjali Yoga, that time, they were hardly one or two people whom Realization was given. Like Rāja Janaka gave Realization to one person, who was the father-in-law of Śhrī Rām.<br>
Then came Moses, Abraham, all these Great Prophets who tried to establish wit... within us the Divine Laws. They told us what are these Divine Laws within us which act, what are our valances as any element has. Invariably, all of Them, from Socrates onward, They all said that there are ten valances within us, like Ten Commandments, which we have to keep them intact.<br>
Out of these people, the Prophets, came oh most of the religions of early times. <font color="red">Like Judaism and other, Zoroastrism, Lao Tze, all these people were saying the same and same thing, that, 'We must have a balance within ourselves to establish the Divine Laws within ourselves.'</font><br>

"Oh," they said, "no! This is something we are doing very ... uh serious work." "What is that?" They started giving Me names: aruṇopāy, tar[u]ṇopāy, this, that. Buthey said: that, "Our guru gives us a śhaktipāt." I said, "What is all that? I have never heard [about] it. In what book have you found it? Is it in Vedas? Is it in Purāṇas? Is it in the Gītā? Or is it in the Bible or Qur'ān, where is it? <font color="red">Did Lao Tze talk about it or Socrates?</font> From where do you get this word śhaktipāt suddenly? I've never heard about it."

In our country also, this knowledge was kept a secret for thousands of years. Though we can say people like Mārkaṇḍeya, whose dates could be fourteen thousand [years ago], or later on, up to Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, people did write about the Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
And at the time of Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, He very clearly talked about it. That was the tradition of evolution described in all these great Scriptures.<br>

It's like the Tree of Spirituality, which had very few flowers. Now the tree has evolved, and there are many flowers. So, it is not hanging in the air or something new. But, supposing, you see a flower on the tree, it's a new thing you feel, but it's built in.<br>
Is all built in, coming through all the traditions of the world.<br>
Everyone has said that, "You must seek your Self"! Everyone has said. There's no .... no Scripture that has not said so. That's what it is!<br>
But, how to achieve it, is rarely described, and one step forward is that: you can achieve it en mass. That's what is, we can say, the evolution in this spiritual method has reached.<br>
All of them were born on the Tree of Life. All of them: one [Tree of Life], at different times.<br>

When Śhrī Mātājī was sailing down the Yangtze River, She remembered how Lao Tze had described this river as Tao. This river is so beautiful on both the sides, that all inspirations of Chinese Paintings come from there: In His poem, Lao Tze has described Tao as that there are beautiful things on the way, but one should be on the move, should not get attracted, but be a mere witness.

"I'm very thankful to [Deputy Lord Mayor] Mister Henry Tsang for addressing you and introducing Me to you. That's very kind of him. It is one of the very rare occasions where I have seen people in authority have understood My work and have tried to help Me.<br>
<font color="red">Whatever he said is really very remarkable, that: all these greater people, like Lao Tze who started Taoism, Buddha who was teaching Buddhism, all of Them talked about the Oneness of human being with the Nature.</font> And if you cannot combine Nature with your Self, then you cannot be called as a[n] evolved Soul.<br>
<font color="red">In that thing I was telling him about Yangtze River, where he comes from the same ... uh-uh-uh-uh ... state Yangtze, that Yangtze River I have traveled through with My husband, and it's-ss the one Lao Tze has used for describing a human accent.</font><br>
Is a river which goes in different angles and makes lots of currents, and is very dangerous to ply through that.<br>
But they are having an, now a uh tourist uh ... arrangement to go through that, and My husband as he was in the maritime, they invited us to see that.<br>
<font color="red">So, in that the message was: that, you see, you are passing through a very beautiful land, you see across the banks beautiful ... uh ... trees and very beautiful mountains, which you see in the paintings of Chinese. They are really like that. But you should not get lost: you have to go further. You can watch ... uh ... these ... uh, all these beautiful scenes, uh sit down there, enjoy yourself, but still you have to go with the stream.<br>
And then you go further and further, He describes very well in His Tao.<br>
Tao means that it is.</font><br>
And it started showing such beautiful uh ... uh-uh-uh scenes, sometimes, that I really [laughing:] felt that, 'I should get out of the boat and sit down there,' like ...<br>
<font color="red">And, but He was meaning that in your meditation, when you are moving, you should not get tempted by this outward ... uh-uh-uh-uh ... fascination of nature also, but you enjoy, be one with it, you just see it, enjoy it. And then He says that the river flows closer to the sea, that is the ultimate aim of the river, then she becomes absolutely silent and she spreads outs [out]. And then gradually she moves towards the sea.<br>
Is such a beautiful description, and I have seen it Myself when I can understand the poet how He wanted to con... communicate that how the nature should teach us how to be meditative within ourselves.</font>"<br>

"Confucius has taught the humanity how we can improve our relations with other human beings. <font color="red">But Lao Tze in Chine has very beautifully described Tao, meaning the Kuṇḍalinī.<br> 
And I have had a voyage through the Yangtze River through which Lao Tze had gone many times. I know he was trying to show that river, which is the Kuṇḍalinī, is flowing towards the sea and one should not be tempted by the nature that is around. The nature around the Yangtze River is very, very beautiful, no doubt, but one has to go through the river. Also there are lots of currents which flow and can be quite dangerous and we need a good navigator who should take his ship across to the point where it is nearer the sea. At that stage it becomes very silent and extremely simple in its flow.<br>
This country has been endowed with great philosophers, I would say the greatest was Lao Tze, because humanism was for the preparation of human beings for their ascent about which Lao Tze had spoken. But because of the subtle subject it was not described in such a clear-cut manner as I am talking to you."</font><br>

She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā). Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918. Altogether there were ten major Avatāras of Dattātreya."<br>

"Religious fundamentalism and fanaticism have already become a threat to World Peace. We had a discussion with some religious people in Italy and they refused to accept a religion which was global. They wanted to have exclusive religions. In this way they promote conflict between the followers of one religion and those of another. They believe that killing others in the name of religion is their duty. On the other hand all the great philosophers, Incarnations, Prophets and Sufis have never talked about any exclusive religion. <font color="red">Confucius first talked about humanity, but then came Tao of Lao Tze who tried to bring the subtle side of humanity. This Tao is something like the Kuṇḍalinī of Sahaja Yoga. I have traveled through the Yangtze River. This voyage on a boat gave me a unique experience and enabled me to understand Lao Tze very well. This river is a very dangerous one in the beginning for boats to pass through. There are lots of currents which flow in different directions. But along the side of this river there are beautiful manifestations of nature. The very steep, rising mountains that we see in the paintings of the Chinese are all to be seen there with rivers flowing between them. It is very beautiful to see the bank of the Yangtze River. As Lao Tze had said: "It may be very beautiful and attractive outside, but you should keep your mind inside and ply through the Yangtze River". This is very significant, but how many understand what He has said? How many have tried to follow Him? In China many people do not seem to care much for Lao Tze and His Tao, but there will come a time when they will realize that that is the subtle side of humanity.</font>"<br>
