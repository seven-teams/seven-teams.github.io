[<b>Page 281:</b>] [To an acupuncturist follower of Śhrī Lao Tze who became aggressive when Śhrī Mātājī moved Her hand around His aura:] "<font color="red">How can you telephone with a disconnected line? You cannot follow Tao. You have to become Tao. You have to be realized otherwise all spiritual practices and gestures are tomfooleries. All your acupuncture will just activate the sympathetic nervous system. If you try to handle your machinery without establishing the connection with the source of its power, the parasympathetic system, you will spoil it. When Lao Tze was alive, how many believed in Him and how many opposed Him? Why do you believe in Lao Tze? Because He is no more and you can handle Him instead of Him handling you. Once He is dead you are using Him and following dead rituals. Today, Lao Tze is dead and Mātājī is living.</font> So many people feel the Divine Breeze in their fingers. My child, how long are you going to cheat yourself? Why not know your own powers?"<br>

<font color="red">"These brief reviews [stanzas from Śhrī Guru Granth Sāhib] illustrate that the theme of Kuṇḍalinī awakening referred to variously as Rebirth, Resurrection, [True] Baptism, Union with Divine, Tao [of Lao Tze], is common throughout mankind's history in all the religions of the world. In fact, this is the essence of all the religions, though because of time and place constraints, it was kept a hidden science in the past."</font><br>

<font color="red">"Not only that, everything that is written in our Scriptures, not only in Hindu Scriptures but the Scriptures of the whole world, about things even those written by Lao Tze, by Socrates, whatever is written, because They all stood for the Truth and the same Truth. There are no two truths."</font><br>

"<font color="red">You see, uh acupuncture or all these uh-uh-uh systems are started by ... uh in the Wes... in the Chinese uh, this thing, there was a very great Sahaja Yogi was Lao Tze. He started acupuncture actually. And He has described Self-realization in [a] very clear way, absolute clear way. And He has said that, "Nobody who is not a self-realized should do acupuncture at all." He has prohibited it completely for people who are not realized Souls. But everybody is doing it, which is a wrong thing.</font><br>
When you do in an unauthorized way, you do cure, but you create an imbalance in the body."<br>

"Only in the human stage, it is said that, "You will become aware of it." Is said in all the Scriptures: like Qur'ān, like Bible, like Vedas, like uh Gītā which is a part of Veda, you can say. <font color="red">Also, Great Sages, all over the world, right from Moses, Abraham, Socrates, Lao Tze, in India, Janaka, Nāṇaka, Vasiṣhṭha, later on, people like, we can say, in the history, about sixth century, we had a very Great Saint or a great personality or an Incarnation like Śhaṅkarāchārya, all these people have been talking about your Second Birth.</font> That you are to be born-again.<br>
Unless and until you are born-again, you are not a Christian, you are not a Hindu, you are not a Muslim.<br>
Keep it one name. There are ten names, to one thing, for twice-born."<br>

<font color="red"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> But I cannot understand this acupuncture at all.<br>
Chinese don't use it in China. Can you imagine? In China they don't.<br>
<b>Sahaja Yoginī:</b> They use it.<br>
<font color="red"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> No! They are telling you lies! They never do it! I've been to China mainland: they never do it in China. All telling you lies.<br>
<font color="red">They don't believe in Lao Tze. They don't believe in Him at all. In mainland China, they don't believe in Lao Tze.</font><br>
Just they don't have it. They have other teas and this and that and they use certain roots, I am more Ayurvedic style, but not, acupuncture they don't have.<br>
<font color="red">I have been in China Myself. They, I asked Him about it [asked about Him]. They said, "Lao Tze! Useless fellow," [some laughter] like that.</font><br>
<font color="red">You see, because after Lao Tze very few people got Realization.</font><br> 
And this one has to know what are the centers in the hand, where they are. They are also using all wrong points, all sympathetic points. They are not using the right points, which are the parasympathetic.<br>

"Now, all the Gurus, all the Gurus who came, say from ... we can start from Socrates, then Abraham, Moses, this is the Guru Tattwa, is the Principle of Master, Primordial Masters. The Principle is born again and again. In India we can say the Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], we had one Ādināth, the Guru long time back. Then we had Dattātreya, we had uh Janaka, Nāṇaka, Sāī Nāth. <font color="red">We had in the Middle East Muhammad Sāhab, Lao Tze in China, Confucius. All these Great Principles of Gurus who were born, They had one job to do is to establish your dharma. Their job was not to give you Realization.</font><br>
You must understand: everyone has one's own job. See, Mine is a horrible job [laughing:] because I have to do everybody's jobs.<br>
<font color="red">But Their job was just to establish your dharma. They came at that time in those places where it was needed the most.<br>
So, these Ten Principles, as I told you, They established [dharma].</font><br> 
<font color="red">They are created in the Void.</font><br>
As you see here the Void part, this part is made out of the water element. <font color="red">So, whatever miracles They did, had something to do with water, like They could create water anywhere They wanted to. They would not cure people. All of Them have created water in the desert or in the places where ... like in ... Nāṇaka has created a Pan̄jā Sāhab they call it, or everywhere They have been able to create water. Whatever They touched, They could create water out of it.</font><br>
Water is the life, life force which sustains us. Without water we cannot live! The is the sustainance [sustenance].<br>
<font color="red">But, They actually are symbolized in an ocean, in the ocean, because They give us the salt, the salt of life, which gives us the sustainance [sustenance].</font> If you see the salt, if we do not have salt in our body, we'll have no sustainance [sustenance]."<br>

<b>Sahaja Yoginī translator:</b> Zen.<br>
<font color="red"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> Oh, great! But you cannot practice without Realization. Zen means: Realization first.<br>
The same thing with us: you can't follow the Zen is Sahaja Yoga. What ... what Zen has taught is Sahaj Yog. Lao Tze, same thing. Is the same. <font color="red">What Muhammad has taught is the same.</font> What Christ has said is the same.

"And these Ten Sustainances [Sustenances] are represented by Great Prophets. The Principle is called as Ādi Guru, in Sanskrit language, the Primordial Master. <font color="red">He had incarnated on this Earth as Abraham, Moses, as Lao Tze, as Confucius, as Socrates.</font> Recently, He has been as Sāī Nāth of Śhirḍī, not the other fellow, and other great people have been like Nāṇaka, Janaka.<br>
All these Great Saints can ... came on this Earth to tell us: how to keep in the center, how to keep our sustenance, how to be human beings.<br>
As carbon has got four valances, we too have got ten valances. We have to maintain those ten valances within us! That's what they came to tell us."<br>

"The Primordial Master was also born as Macchindranāth, and again as Zoroaster who was worshiped by the ancient Persians, and still revered by Parsis. Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism. <font color="red">In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates.</font> He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā). Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918. Altogether there were ten major Avatāras of Dattātreya."<br>

"Religious fundamentalism and fanaticism have already become a threat to World Peace. We had a discussion with some religious people in Italy and they refused to accept a religion which was global. They wanted to have exclusive religions. In this way they promote conflict between the followers of one religion and those of another. They believe that killing others in the name of religion is their duty. On the other hand all the great philosophers, Incarnations, Prophets and Sufis have never talked about any exclusive religion. <font color="red">Confucius first talked about humanity, but then came Tao of Lao Tze who tried to bring the subtle side of humanity. This Tao is something like the Kuṇḍalinī of Sahaja Yoga. I have traveled through the Yangtze River. This voyage on a boat gave me a unique experience and enabled me to understand Lao Tze very well. This river is a very dangerous one in the beginning for boats to pass through. There are lots of currents which flow in different directions. But along the side of this river there are beautiful manifestations of nature. The very steep, rising mountains that we see in the paintings of the Chinese are all to be seen there with rivers flowing between them. It is very beautiful to see the bank of the Yangtze River. As Lao Tze had said: "It may be very beautiful and attractive outside, but you should keep your mind inside and ply through the Yangtze River". This is very significant, but how many understand what He has said? How many have tried to follow Him? In China many people do not seem to care much for Lao Tze and His Tao, but there will come a time when they will realize that that is the subtle side of humanity.</font>"<br>
