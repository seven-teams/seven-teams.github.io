[<b>Page 281:</b>] [To an acupuncturist follower of Śhrī Lao Tze who became aggressive when Śhrī Mātājī moved Her hand around His aura:] "<font color="red">How can you telephone with a disconnected line? You cannot follow Tao. You have to become Tao. You have to be realized otherwise all spiritual practices and gestures are tomfooleries. All your acupuncture will just activate the sympathetic nervous system. If you try to handle your machinery without establishing the connection with the source of its power, the parasympathetic system, you will spoil it. When Lao Tze was alive, how many believed in Him and how many opposed Him? Why do you believe in Lao Tze? Because He is no more and you can handle Him instead of Him handling you. Once He is dead you are using Him and following dead rituals. Today, Lao Tze is dead and Mātājī is living.</font> So many people feel the Divine Breeze in their fingers. My child, how long are you going to cheat yourself? Why not know your own powers?"<br>

<font color="red">"These brief reviews [stanzas from Śhrī Guru Granth Sāhib] illustrate that the theme of Kuṇḍalinī awakening referred to variously as Rebirth, Resurrection, [True] Baptism, Union with Divine, Tao [of Lao Tze], is common throughout mankind's history in all the religions of the world. In fact, this is the essence of all the religions, though because of time and place constraints, it was kept a hidden science in the past."</font><br>

"<font color="red">You see, uh acupuncture or all these uh-uh-uh systems are started by ... uh in the Wes... in the Chinese uh, this thing, there was a very great Sahaja Yogi was Lao Tze. He started acupuncture actually. And He has described Self-realization in [a] very clear way, absolute clear way. And He has said that, "Nobody who is not a self-realized should do acupuncture at all." He has prohibited it completely for people who are not realized Souls. But everybody is doing it, which is a wrong thing.</font><br>

Just they don't have it. They have other teas and this and that and they use certain roots, I am more Ayurvedic style, but not, acupuncture they don't have.<br>
<font color="red">I have been in China Myself. They, I asked Him about it [asked about Him]. They said, "Lao Tze! Useless fellow," [some laughter] like that.</font><br>
<font color="red">You see, because after Lao Tze very few people got Realization.</font><br> 
And this one has to know what are the centers in the hand, where they are. They are also using all wrong points, all sympathetic points. They are not using the right points, which are the parasympathetic.<br>

"Now, all the Gurus, all the Gurus who came, say from ... we can start from Socrates, then Abraham, Moses, this is the Guru Tattwa, is the Principle of Master, Primordial Masters. The Principle is born again and again. In India we can say the Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], we had one Ādināth, the Guru long time back. Then we had Dattātreya, we had uh Janaka, Nāṇaka, Sāī Nāth.<br>
<font color="red">We had in the Middle East Muhammad Sāhab, Lao Tze in China, Confucius.</font><br> 
<font color="red">All these Great Principles of Gurus who were born, They had one job to do is to establish your dharma. Their job was not to give you Realization.</font><br>
You must understand: everyone has one's own job.</font><br> 
See, Mine is a horrible job [laughing:] because I have to do everybody's jobs.<br>
<font color="red">But Their job was just to establish your dharma. They came at that time in those places where it was needed the most.<br>
So, these Ten Principles, as I told you, They established [dharma].</font><br> 
<font color="red">They are created in the Void.</font><br>
As you see here the Void part, this part is made out of the water element. <font color="red">So, whatever miracles They did, had something to do with water, like They could create water anywhere They wanted to. They would not cure people. All of Them have created water in the desert or in the places where ... like in ... Nāṇaka has created a Pan̄jā Sāhab they call it, or everywhere They have been able to create water. Whatever They touched, They could create water out of it.</font><br>
Water is the life, life force which sustains us. Without water we cannot live! The is the sustainance [sustenance].<br>
<font color="red">But, They actually are symbolized in an ocean, in the ocean, because They give us the salt, the salt of life, which gives us the sustainance [sustenance].</font> If you see the salt, if we do not have salt in our body, we'll have no sustainance [sustenance]."<br>

"People very religiously sit down and discuss God. It's most surprising for Me.<br>
You have to become. It's an actualization. It's a Real Baptism you must have. It is your right to have it! You are seeking that alone and nothing else! You have to get it within yourself! If you cannot get it, then you are not going to be a happy person.<br>
Don't run after falsehood. Ask for the Reality. And the Reality is that: the Spirit resides within your heart.<br>
You don't have to travel for that.<br>

"[Pointing down from Viśhuddhi chakra to Nābhī chakra on the Chakra Chart:] The connection is that this seeking [slowly makes three and a half clockwise circles inside the Void around the Nābhī chakra on the Chakra Chart:] goes in developing and there are Ten Principles which are described as the Ten Commandments, you can say, or we have got Ten Sūtras is, in Sanskrit language they are called as Ten Sūtras.<br>
Gāndhījī [laughing:] put one more, by saying that, 'We should use only Indian ... Indian things, not foreign things, because then they will dominate us.' So he put ekādeśha [ekādaśha=eleven], he put one more.<br>
But there are Ten, which are here, which are described as [the] Ten Commandments in the Bible.<br>
<font color="red">And [doing a clockwise bandhan from right top to bottom and to left top inside the Void on the Chakra Chart:] these are the Ten Primordial Masters who were born on this Earth. Say we can start from Socrates, then we can think of other, in India was Dattātreya, is the ... Dattātreya is the essence, and He is born as Socrates, He is born as Lao Tze, He is born as Abraham, as Moses, He is born as, up till now we can say, Muhammad Sāhab, Nāṇaka, latest is the Sāī Nāth of Śhirḍī.</font> He is the One who [pointing with one more circle inside the Void on the Chakra Chart:] represents, They all represent, this Primordial Master's Principle of Religion."<br>

"Today I would like to say about this chakra especially that is the ... what we call the Nābhī chakra, is the central path of our evolution where you start your seeking and youge [you] cross over to [the] other side.<br>
Now, surrounding this you will find there is the Ocean of Illusion. And this Ocean of Illusion was governed by a Deity, by a special powerful personality whom we call as Dattātreya -- is the Primordial Master. And He incarnated on this Earth many a times. <font color="red">At the time of Christ, and even before that, He incarnated as, say, Abraham, Moses, Socrates, Lao Tze.</font> Later on, He incarnated as Muhammad Sāhab, then the same Great Principle incarnated as Nāṇaka, then the same Principle at the last incarnated as Sāī Nāth of Śhirḍī.<br>
So the same Great Principle of this Primordial Master has incarnated because without a master, how will you be taken away from in ... this illusion? How you are going to be exposed to that reality which you do not feel?<br>
What has to happen to you is that you have to become more sensitive, more open, awakened, enlightened to feel that's All-pervading Power around you.<br>
Now, these [masters] came again and again and told you that you must look after your dharma.<br>
Dharma doesn't mean any religion that is being established in the names of these people, because human beings know how to make a pickle out of everyone. They are great 'experts'.<br>
All of Them in essence are one and the same.<br>
But like flowers on the same tree can be taken away from time to time and then when they become ugly and they become completely spoilt, then people can claim, 'This is my flower,' 'This is my flower.' Everybody has become a contractor of this thing.<br>
Actually these people belong to the whole universe, They are universal beings and They came on this Earth to give us a sustainance [sustenance] within us, a sustainance [sustenance].<br>
Dharma means a sustainance [sustenance], that is we can say, that is quality that is ... that is human."<br>

"Now whatever Arneau has told you, or  whatever I am going to tell you, is the knowledge of the roots, which was kept secret for thousands of years. And first time in the sixth century people started talking openly about it and telling: what are we inside ourselves.<br>
But all the Great Incarnations who came in this tradition of spirituality, one by one manifested, every time, a new awareness in the human dimension.<br>
In the ancient time when they followed Patañjali Yoga, that time, they were hardly one or two people whom Realization was given. Like Rāja Janaka gave Realization to one person, who was the father-in-law of Śhrī Rām.<br>
Then came Moses, Abraham, all these Great Prophets who tried to establish wit... within us the Divine Laws. They told us what are these Divine Laws within us which act, what are our valances as any element has. Invariably, all of Them, from Socrates onward, They all said that there are ten valances within us, like Ten Commandments, which we have to keep them intact.<br>
Out of these people, the Prophets, came oh most of the religions of early times. <font color="red">Like Judaism and other, Zoroastrism, Lao Tze, all these people were saying the same and same thing, that, 'We must have a balance within ourselves to establish the Divine Laws within ourselves.'</font><br>

<font color="red">"Like in China, Confucius said that, "You must become very virtuous, righteous," because the Chinese were lethargic farmers, "and you must work," humanism He started. But now they found out that now they are going too much towards it. So Lao Tze came. You see, They had to work it out, because some people move like a pendulum on one side, then They have to move them on the other side. Lao Tze came, He talked about Tao."</font><br>

"Now when I'm talking to you about the mechanism that is built within us for our last breakthrough, you need not believe Me. <br>
In our country also, this knowledge was kept a secret for thousands of years. Though we can say people like Mārkaṇḍeya, whose dates could be fourteen thousand [years ago], or later on, up to Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, people did write about the Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
And at the time of Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, He very clearly talked about it. That was the tradition of evolution described in all these great Scriptures.<br>
Even in the Bible, you find the Tree of Fire. It says: "I will appear before you as tongues of flames." <br>
Even Muhammad Sāhab, who came much later, very clearly, very, very clearly, and elaborately, at length, talked about the Resurrection Day. He said: "At the Time of Resurrection, your hands will speak."<br>
But everybody missed the point.<br>
Zoroaster talked about it thousands of years back. <font color="red">Confucius, Lao Tze, everyone talked about it: that, 'We have to be the Spirit.'</font><br>
Christ clearly said: "You are to be born-again!" Then Nicodemus asked Him: "Do you mean to say, I should enter into the womb of my mother?" "No," He said, "whatever is born of the flesh is the flesh. You are to be born of the Holy Ghost." "<br>

"This is all absolutely traditional but is not a dead tradition.<br>
It's like the Tree of Spirituality, which had very few flowers. Now the tree has evolved, and there are many flowers. So, it is not hanging in the air or something new. But, supposing, you see a flower on the tree, it's a new thing you feel, but it's built in.<br>
Is all built in, coming through all the traditions of the world.<br>
Everyone has said that, "You must seek your Self"! Everyone has said. There's no .... no Scripture that has not said so. That's what it is!<br>
But, how to achieve it, is rarely described, and one step forward is that: you can achieve it en mass. That's what is, we can say, the evolution in this spiritual method has reached.<br>
All of them were born on the Tree of Life. All of them: one [Tree of Life], at different times.<br>
But people plucked the flowers, and said that, 'This is my flower,' 'This is my flower,' and are fighting with the dead flowers.<br>
<font color="red">Lao Tze said the same thing, if you say, start from Confucius to Lao Tze, to this side you go ... to the other side of it uh ... uh Christ has said the same thing.</font> I mean, endless people. Muhammad said the same thing, Abraham said the same thing, then Rāma, Kṛiṣhṇa, all of them have said the same thing. All the Saints, the real Saints of the world has [have] said the same thing.

<b>Sahaja Yogi:</b> [Summarizes a gentleman:] "Is Kuṇḍalinī the only force in this particular time, that will do this particular job?"<br>
<font color="red"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> No, all the time this was the force, all the time. Is all the time, this was the force. It's called, also, in the Bible it is said, that, about the Tree of Life, is this mechanism. Also said that, "I'll p... appear before you as tongues of flames," is the Kuṇḍal... the ... when the Kuṇḍalinī rises, then your centers look like that. So many things there are even in the Bible. In everything, in Qur'ān it is called as 'Asas. The names are different, but it is so.<br>
<font color="red">Like Tao is the Kuṇḍalinī. Tao as described, is also Kuṇḍalinī.</font><br> 
Zen system, Zen also means the same, Dhyāna, is the same thing.<br> 
Confucius talked of the same thing, Socrates talked of the same thing.<br>
But only thing it was not so said so clearly. Because there were not people intelligent as you are today, to understand [laughing:] it, I think, that it was not said so clearly.<br>

"I never read Scriptures, [laughs] I don't think I have to read them because I know them, but I was reading uh the Qur'ān and also the Bible uh from this science, Christian science thing. All other scriptures also. I mean, what they are saying is absolutely true, that you have to be righteous, you have to be above vi[o]lence, you have to be detached. 
All these things are absolutely the same, no doubt. There's no change. In all these Scriptures they say the same thing. <font color="red">This was said about eight thousand] [8,000] years back by Śhrī Rāma, then by Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, then it was said by Socrates, Lao Tze, Abraham.

"<font color="red">Those who were Saints, in any country, take it Lao Tze, you can take from Socrates onward this side, Muhammad Sāhab, Nāṇak Sāhab, all of these people, you will be amazed to find that all these people behaved in such a manner that we cannot find faults with them. I mean if you want to find, you may with your ignorance. But the kind of life if They led, how is it that They were like that? What was so great? It was Their Divinity which expressed.</font><br>
While we all have this Divinity within ourselves, we have all these powers within ourselves, only thing: we have to use those powers, we have to manifest them. And for that manifestation, is ... is important that we have to become self-realized, in the sense that you have to get your Second Birth. <br>

This-s old science is not only from India. It comes from everywhere. <font color="red">As I told you Confucius knew this, Socrates knew this, and, also, many people like William Blake and C.S. Lewis, all these people knew about it.</font><br>

"The Primordial Master was also born as Macchindranāth, and again as Zoroaster who was worshiped by the ancient Persians, and still revered by Parsis. Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism. <font color="red">In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates.</font> He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā). Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918. Altogether there were ten major Avatāras of Dattātreya."<br>

"Religious fundamentalism and fanaticism have already become a threat to World Peace. We had a discussion with some religious people in Italy and they refused to accept a religion which was global. They wanted to have exclusive religions. In this way they promote conflict between the followers of one religion and those of another. They believe that killing others in the name of religion is their duty. On the other hand all the great philosophers, Incarnations, Prophets and Sufis have never talked about any exclusive religion. <font color="red">Confucius first talked about humanity, but then came Tao of Lao Tze who tried to bring the subtle side of humanity. This Tao is something like the Kuṇḍalinī of Sahaja Yoga. I have traveled through the Yangtze River. This voyage on a boat gave me a unique experience and enabled me to understand Lao Tze very well. This river is a very dangerous one in the beginning for boats to pass through. There are lots of currents which flow in different directions. But along the side of this river there are beautiful manifestations of nature. The very steep, rising mountains that we see in the paintings of the Chinese are all to be seen there with rivers flowing between them. It is very beautiful to see the bank of the Yangtze River. As Lao Tze had said: "It may be very beautiful and attractive outside, but you should keep your mind inside and ply through the Yangtze River". This is very significant, but how many understand what He has said? How many have tried to follow Him? In China many people do not seem to care much for Lao Tze and His Tao, but there will come a time when they will realize that that is the subtle side of humanity.</font>"<br>
