Śhrī Mandodarī ("soft-bellied") was the daughter of Mayasura (Maya), a dānava who was a greatly skilled architect and of his wife Hema. She became the queen consort of the demon Rāvaṇa as a boon given by Śhrī Śhiva to Rāvaṇa.  Śhrī Mandodarī bore Rāvaṇa 4 sons: Meghanada, Atikaya, Prahasta, and Akshayakumara.

Jay Śhrī Mātājī!
