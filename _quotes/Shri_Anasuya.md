Śhrī Anasūyā (meaning 'without malice, envy or spite') was the wife of Sage Atri, one of the seven Brahmarishis (sons of Brahma) and the mother of Śhrī Ādi Guru Dattātreya, of Śhrī Chandra Dev Moon, of Sage Durvasa, and of Chandrātri. She lived with Her husband in a small hermitage in the southern periphery of the forest Chitrakuta. When Śhrī Sītā and Śhrī Rāma visited Her during their exile, Śhrī Anasūyā gave Śhrī Sita an ointment which could maintain Her beauty forever.
