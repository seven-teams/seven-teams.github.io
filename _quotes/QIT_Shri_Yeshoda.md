"Now, Jesus Christ thing.<br>
<font color="red">Jesus, Jesu or Yeśhu, this is the name of Yeśhodā, was given by Rādhā to Her Son. We say Yesu or Jesu.</font> And Krist is His surname."<br>

"Now just put attention on the word Christ. The name comes from Krist. And Krist comes from Kṛiṣhṇa. Because He was Kṛiṣhṇa's Son, so the name of Father was continuing so His name was Krist. But His name was Jesus also, that is because He was also the Son of Rādhā. <font color="red">Rādhā thought that, 'Till today nowhere the name of Jaśhodā was mentioned.' That's why Ya-śho-dā means Jesus. Like we say Yasodā, we say Jesu. If someone's name is Jasoda, he will be known as Jesu, and Jasoda will be known as Jesu.<br>
Many people like in Maharashtra know him as Yeśhu and Jasoda as Jesu.</font>"<br>

"Christ is none other, He is the incarnation of Śhrī Gaṇeśh.<br>
How He was made? If you read Devī Bhāgavat[am] by Mārkaṇḍeya, you will understand. He was made as Mahāviṣhṇu first and was described as how He is the basis of this Universe and how Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa who is the father of Christ, that is why He is called Christ. They call Him Christ, like it is the surname. <font color="red">And Yaśhodājī's name is used and He is also called as Yeśhu. That is how Rādhāji Herself kept His name, and Rādhāji is His mother.</font>"<br>

<b>Version 1:</b><br>  
"Do read Devī Māhātmyam or Devī Bhāgavat[am]. Go through the description of Śhrī Mahāviṣhṇu in it. It is described that Śhrī Rādhājī prepared Her Son similarly as Śhrī Pārvatī did it but the main principle in this is Śhrī Gaṇeśha Principle and the Son prepared as Śhrī Gaṇeśha came in the world as Jesus Christ.<br>
<font color="red">Because Christ was prepared by Rādhājī so He got the name Christ in the name of Kṛiṣhṇa and Yeśhu in the name of Yaśhodā.</font> In this way, She manifested the Gaṇeśha Principle in the form of Śhrī Christ."<br>
<br>
<b>Version 2:</b><br>
Nowadays nobody reads Mārkaṇḍeya, but if you can get it, read the description of Śhrī Mahāviṣhṇu.<br>
He has mentioned that Rādhā had created Her own Son by Herself. Means just as Pārvatī created Her Son, She too had created [Hers].<br>
But Gaṇeśh Tattwa is the base for it. And based on Gaṇeśh Tattwa, the Son She had created, He came in this world as Christ.<br>
<font color="red">Now Christ. As Rādhā had created Him, He is called Christ in the name of Kṛiṣhṇa and as Yaśhodā is there, hence Yeśhu.</font><br>
In this way She has positioned the Gaṇeśh Tattwa in the form of Christ.<br>

"Now, if you study the etymology of the word Christ, you would know that the word has originated from a corrupted form of word Kṛiṣhṇa.<br>
As a matter of fact, the Father of Jesus Christ is Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. That is why He is called Christ.<br>
The manner in which His name Jesus originated is also very interesting. <font color="red">The mother of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, Śhrī Yaśhodā Mātā, was addressed as Yesu. Even today, we notice that in northern Indian somebody named Yeśhu is not addressed as such but as Jesu. It is therefore clear, that from Yaśhodā came the word Yeśhu and then further became the word Jesu, and finally the name Jesus Christ.</font>"<br>

"Ādi Viṣhṇu's eighth form was as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa during the Dwāpara Yuga, and again Ādi Śhakti took three forms. Mahākālī lived for a very short time as Viṣhṇumāyā, the infant sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. <font color="red">She was actually born as the daughter of Yeśhodā, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's foster mother, and was killed by the demon Kaṃsa.</font> She later took birth as Draupadī, wife of the Pāṇḍavas. <font color="red">Yeśhodā was Herself an Incarnation of Mahāsaraswatī.</font> As Mahālakṣhmī She took two forms, Rādhā and Rukmiṇī. '<i>Rā</i>' means power or energy and '<i>dhā</i>' means sustenance, so the name 'Rādhā' means the one who sustains the power. As Rukmiṇī She became Queen to Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, the King in Dvārakā.<br>
......<br>
Rādhā in Mary's Incarnation wanted to give Her Son the name of Her Lord, Kṛiṣhṇa. Kṛiṣhṇa comes from '<i>kṛiṣhi</i>' + '<i>\it ṇa</i>'. '<i>Kṛiṣhi</i>' means farming, '<i>ṇa</i>' means the one who carries. So the name 'Christ' came from the 'kṛiṣhi' in Kṛiṣhṇa. <font color="red">The name Jesus was derived from Jasodā, a form of Yeśhodā, the foster mother of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. Rādhā also wanted to give Yeśhodā's name to Her Son because of Yeśhodā's devotion and worship of Her in Vṛindāvan and Gokul. The abbreviation of Yeśhodā was 'Jesu' or 'Yesu', so Rādhā/Mary named Her Son Jesus Christ.</font>"<br>
