"Now just put attention on the word Christ. The name comes from Krist. And Krist comes from Kṛiṣhṇa. Because He was Kṛiṣhṇa's Son, so the name of Father was continuing so His name was Krist. But His name was Jesus also, that is because He was also the Son of Rādhā. <font color="red">Rādhā thought that, 'Till today nowhere the name of Jaśhodā was mentioned.' That's why Ya-śho-dā means Jesus. Like we say Yasodā, we say Jesu. If someone's name is Jasoda, he will be known as Jesu, and Jasoda will be known as Jesu.<br>
Many people like in Maharashtra know Him as Yeśhu and Jasoda as Jesu.</font>"<br>

"Christ is none other, He is the incarnation of Śhrī Gaṇeśh.<br>
How He was made? If you read Devī Bhāgavat[am] by Mārkaṇḍeya, you will understand. He was made as Mahāviṣhṇu first and was described as how He is the basis of this Universe and how Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa who is the father of Christ, that is why He is called Christ. They call Him Christ, like it is the surname. <font color="red">And Yaśhodājī's name is used and He is also called as Yeśhu.

<b>Version 1:</b><br>  
"Do read Devī Māhātmyam or Devī Bhāgavat[am]. Go through the description of Śhrī Mahāviṣhṇu in it. It is described that Śhrī Rādhājī prepared Her Son similarly as Śhrī Pārvatī did it but the main principle in this is Śhrī Gaṇeśha Principle and the Son prepared as Śhrī Gaṇeśha came in the world as Jesus Christ.<br>
<font color="red">Because Christ was prepared by Rādhājī so He got the name Christ in the name of Kṛiṣhṇa and Yeśhu in the name of Yaśhodā.</font> In this way, She manifested the Gaṇeśha Principle in the form of Śhrī Christ."<br>
<br>
<b>Version 2:</b><br>
Nowadays nobody reads Mārkaṇḍeya, but if you can get it, read the description of Śhrī Mahāviṣhṇu.<br>
He has mentioned that Rādhā had created Her own Son by Herself. Means just as Pārvatī created Her Son, She too had created [Hers].<br>
But Gaṇeśh Tattwa is the base for it. And based on Gaṇeśh Tattwa, the Son She had created, He came in this world as Christ.<br>
<font color="red">Now Christ. As Rādhā had created Him, He is called Christ in the name of Kṛiṣhṇa and as Yaśhodā is there, hence Yeśhu.</font><br>
In this way She has positioned the Gaṇeśh Tattwa in the form of Christ.<br>

"Now, if you study the etymology of the word Christ, you would know that the word has originated from a corrupted form of word Kṛiṣhṇa.<br>
As a matter of fact, the Father of Jesus Christ is Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. That is why He is called Christ.<br>
The manner in which His name Jesus originated is also very interesting. <font color="red">The mother of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, Śhrī Yaśhodā Mātā, was addressed as Yesu. Even today, we notice that in northern Indian somebody named Yeśhu is not addressed as such but as Jesu. It is therefore clear, that from Yaśhodā came the word Yeśhu and then further became the word Jesu, and finally the name Jesus Christ.</font>"<br>

<p>
<font color="red">"The name Jesus also comes from the word Yeśhodā. Yeśhodā was the foster mother of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa and Rādhā thought that Her name must be brought in because She was also another power. So, Yeśhodā is called also as Jesodā in the northern parts, in where Kṛiṣhṇa lived. She was called actually like Jesodā.</font> And the small [short] form of Jesodā is Jesu. And that's why He was called as Jesu or Yesu. In Indian languages He is called as Yesu [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] Jesu. And even in Hebrew He is called as Yesu, not as Jesu.<br>
You see, this Y and J, like Yugoslavians and all these people use, is a confusion between Y, ya and ja. And these two words are confused in the world: Yesu or Jesu.<br>
......<br>
The left-hand side is the one when He was ... born and His early life when He has a sister.<br>
<font color="red">His sister was, actually the daughter of Yeśhodā, was sacrificed, [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] big story: how Kṛiṣhṇa was born in a jail and He's taken .. uh by Kaṃsa ... uh by His father and put it in a ... and the place called uh Gokul, and the child in that place who was a girl who was sent.</font> And She is the one who appears as the ... uh lightning in the air. And how She became the lightning when She was killed and announced that, "Your killer is still a li... alive" to the horrible rākṣhasa who was actually the brother of Kṛiṣhṇa's mother. There was announced that, 'The eighth child of this Devakī,' his sister, is Kaṃsa's sister, Kaṃsa is the rākṣhasa, is the ... is the devil, 'will kill him.'<br>
And this frightened him so much that he started killing all the children that were born to this Devakī, his sister, who was put in the jail. The last one was Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br>
And when He was born, everybody slept off. And the doors opened up, and His father carried Him in a basket, just like Moses story is, and crossed the River Yamunā. <font color="red">And when the river touched Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's Feet it again went down, crossed over, went to Gokul, put the child there, took the child of Nand, Yeśhodā, and brought the child back and he placed it.</font> Then the child was replaced, you see, it was a girl.<br>
So Kaṃsa came and said, he said, "The eighth is a girl, how can it be?" So then he just hurled the girl. And She went up and She announced: that, "The killer of you, Ka... Kaṃsa, is born there and He's living very much. Ad He is going to ... He's going to kill you! Beware."<br>
And then the story is that how he tried to kill Him, so that you forget about that. But the main thing I'm telling it's was the sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa."<br>

"His name Christ comes from the word Kṛiṣhṇa, Krist. And the second one is Jesus.<br>
<font color="red">Chri... Kṛiṣhṇa had a foster mother whom Rādhā loved very much. Her name was Yeśhodā, we also call her as Jesodā.</font><br>
Christ is called also as Yesu in India. The short form of Jesodā is Yesu or Jesu, we have both the things. From there the name Jesus has come.<br>
<font color="red">She wanted to name Her [Him] after the foster mother. Because She was a lady, so She was called as Jesodā. But for a man, She selected the name Yesu and Jesu.</font><br>
Moreover, the word Jesu or Yesu is very important. Je, ja in Sanskrit language means -- every word has a meaning in Sanskrit language -- means to know, is to know, the knowledge: gyā-na. "Jā neti [jānāti] sa Gyāna." The One who knows! But Je-su, su means auspicious. Su means 'that brings auspiciousness, that brings blessings'. Je-su: is 'the One who knows how to bring auspiciousness on this Earth'.<br>
People never told this! They never knew! [Those] who went from here with the message that Christ was born."</font><br>

"Now the main thing is, about Christ one has to understand, that His name was Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ: Jesus comes from the word Je-su. <font color="red">Jesu means -- there was the foster mother of Christ ... foster mother of Kṛiṣhṇa who was called as Jeśhodā. The name Jesu comes from that Jesodā.</font><br>
In Indian languages, a short form Ye ... Yeśhodā is Jesu or Yesu. We even call Christ Yesu. We call Him Yesu as well as Jesu, many people call Him Yesu. In many European countries is also [that] they call Him Yesu.<br>
Now this Yeśhodā was the foster mother.<br>
And Christ itself comes from the word Kṛiṣhṇa. Kṛiṣhṇa means: the one who has done the -- what you call -- sowing, sowing of the seed. Is the sowing of the seed. He has done the sowing. He's Kṛiṣhṇa.<br>
And Rādhā Herself is Mahālakṣhmī and She was born as the Mother of Christ."</font><br>

"But even the nime ... name of Christ comes to Him from the same heritage, which I was telling you, that His name was Ye-su [Yeśhu], not Jesus, because in the Bible I get Myself confused when I read that Anna was not Anna, it [she] was Hannah, John was Yohan. Every name has been corrupted in the English Bible. In the same way they have corrupted Christ's name, Yeśhu, into Jesus. Actually, they called Him, some people of course call Him Jesu.<br>
This is the name given to Him by Śhrī Rādhājī, the One who was the Power of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. <font color="red">She's the One who gave Him this name because She was very much indebted to the foster mother of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, who was Yeśhodā.</font> And that's why She called Him Yeśhu.<br>
Yeśhu is the word in Hebrew language. And we call Yeśhodā as Yeśhu, also some people in a uh-uh-uh, what you call, in a country language also call the same thing as Jesu [Yeśhu]. You know that Y and J's always, sort of, brought together in that way, like Yugoslavia we call it, they call it Jugoslavia.<br>
So, His name Yeśhu comes from that, and that's how He was created a special One. In the Devī Māhātmyam it is said that Kṛiṣhṇa has said that, "You will become the Support of the Universe." "</font><br>

"And most of you Sahaja Yogis know the relationship of Christ and Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, why He was called Christ. Christ words comes from the same kṛiṣhi.<br>

"So you have to not fight yourself but to tame. And this is very easy. You'll start enjoying it, looking at yourself: 'Oh mister so-and-so.' Then you won't be angry. 'I know how to handle you. You are hiding behind there, all right, giving excuses.' And the child grows big, so big that mother sees that and is amazed.<br>
<font color="red">Like in Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's childhood, the Mother was Yeśhodā and the child was Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, is very symbolic. And He used to play very naughty tricks [a Sahaja Yoginī laughs]. And She said: "You went and ate that mud from there. I know You have eaten." He said, "How can I eat? How can I? I can't even go out of the house. I'm sitting down here. Where is the mud? How can I eat?" "You did eat, I know You have eaten. So, better show Me Your mouth." He says, "Really?" And then the mouth opens and the complete Viśhwa Swarūpa, complete vision of the whole Viśhwa She sees, and the Mother falls at His Feet.</font><br>
That's what it should be. This mother has to fall at the feet of the child that has grown. Very symbolic. That is how you have to grow: into that Viśhwa Swarūpa, into that Collective Being, into that Virāṭa.<br>
Arjuna and Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa is another very good symbolic thing. Arjuna was a friend who used to take liberties with Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa tried to tell him about Gītā, all these things. But still Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa could not convince him of that. All these were just outside, bla bla bla's, as Mother['s] talks are.<br>
Mother['s] talks are very entertaining, you know: very humorous, nice to hear them, instead of listening to any music better to hear Mother's talks. And then the people think: if they are listening to Mother they have become Mother already.<br>
That's it, happened to Arjuna also. But still he said e ... he found out that there's something lacking in him, that he has not become the ideal. Still his attention is not there as it should have been. So he asked Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa: "I think I'll see your great image." Kṛiṣhṇa said, "All right, are you prepared?" He said, "Yes, I am prepared." And then He became the Virāṭa, the vision of the Virāṭa, and when he saw it, he said, "It's, stop it, is too much for me!"<br>
That's what should happen to your friend, who is this child: that it should become that Virāṭ, [and] when you see that, should be amazed at yourself, 'Oh God, I have grown like this‽' Just like Yeśhodā falling at the Feet of the little Child, you have to fall at the feet of the child that is within you.<br>
I'm sure this will happen now."<br>

"This is the Power of Viṣhṇumāyā, because Viṣhṇumāyā is the One Who was the sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. She came as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's sister. Of course, She is the virgin. She was born as the sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br>
Now see, the story is very interesting. If you see the story, then you'll understand what I'm trying to tell you.<br>
The story is like this. The eighth eh ... Incarnation, as they call it, Power -- according to Sahaja Yoga we call Him the King of the Viśhuddhi Chakra -- Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was to be born. He was born in a-h ah-aha-ah ... jail. His parents were in the jail. <font color="red">So, Viṣhṇumāyā, at the same time, took birth in a village called as Nandagram [50 kms NW of the town of Vṛindāvan, UP,] where another friend called Nanda was living in, and his wife was Yeśhodā. She took Her birth in that family.</font> Now, then She was a very, very powerful child. When Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was born, He was carried by the father from the jail. Because of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's Powers, all his shackles, all his chains were broken, the doors opened, and he waded through the River Jamunā and carried the child and gave it to Nanda.<br>
Nanda said: "I have got a child but She is a girl, about the same time."<br>
<font color="red">So, see the power, that time, this little child gave to Mother Yeśhodā.</font><br>
They said, "All right. Do one thing: take this child with you and replace it with Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa."<br>
<font color="red">What a sacrifice for a woman: to give her own child at that time, a little babe, to be killed by this horrible fellow, Kaṃsa!</font> No mother would do such a thing! Can you think of any mother who will give her child to be killed for the replacement of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa? We cannot think of any mother, but we had some mothers like this in India who did very great sacrifices.<br>
Now this was the greatest sacrifice one could think of for a woman. She may sacrifice small, little things, or quite a lot of things, but to sacrifice your own child is the greatest thing.<br>
The woman sacrifices for her children, quite a lot: she works for them, uah-ah-ah she keeps nights and nights vigil for them. She does so much for her children!<br>
<font color="red">But to give up Her own child is something, such a[n] extraordinary thing, which She did!</font><br>
And when he brought the child, that child was the Power, was the Ādi Śhakti in the form of a virgin, and was kept back.<br>
So when this Kaṃsa came in the morning, and he heard a little girl is born, he was amazed. "It used to ... it was going to be a son, how is it a girl is born? Whatever it is," he said, "I'll destroy this Child." Got hold of that Child and he was about to hit the Child on the ground, when She slipped out and went into the sky, and became a lightning to announce-s-s that: "The One Who was to destroy [you] is still alive." He was shocked.<br>
<font color="red">So behind all this what we see a character of Yeśhodā who was so sacrificing, of the father who was so sacrificing, of a society where it was important to preserve the Incarnation above everything else.</font><br>
And this kind of happening when it took place, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa grew up in the house of Nand, where He then expressed Himself as a powerful personality."<br>

"But at the time of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, She was born as the sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br>
And instead of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa being killed by Her uncle, as you know the story is, She was exchanged. <font color="red">She was actually the daughter of Yeśhodā: exchanged for Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.</font> And this girl, little girl was killed by the uncle of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, who became the lightning in the sky and announced that, "Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa has already incarnated, and your uh destiny is in His hands, and He is going to kill you." She told Kaṃsa.<br>
So this is the Viṣhṇumāyā."<br>

"Now I have to tell you about also the origin of Viṣhṇumāyā, which is very interesting.<br>
Viṣhṇumāyā was the sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, who was born after Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was born.<br>
<font color="red">Actually, She was not His own sister, but She was the daughter of Nanda. And when Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was taken over and was put in the care of Nand and Yeśhodā, they gave their own daughter in His place.</font> And the father of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa brought It back.<br>
So, when Kaṃsa came. the uncle -- you all know about the story -- to ask about the eighth child, they said, "This is the child!" He said, "But is not a man! This is a woman." He took the child [gesturing whirling:] in his hand, and did like this and threw it in the sky. And there She went. And there She announced: that, "Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa is already incarnated, He is living, and He is your killer." "<br>

"<font color="red">Also, His mother was there, Yeśhodā.</font> And when Rādhājī was the Mahālakṣhmī, Mother Mary, and She gave birth to Śhrī Gaṇeśha, that was Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
In India, nobody would doubt the uh-uh-uh uh-uh Immaculate Conception, nobody would doubt. But for others it is too much to-oo-oo believe in the Immaculap ... Immaculate Conception, or they are all arguing and saying all kinds of nonsensical things. Because Gaṇeśha was created like that, and, also, Christ could be created like that.<br>
......<br>
[After 15 seconds:] So Rā-dhā: She was Mother Mary.
And, it is surprising, if you read the Devī Māhātmyam, in that, it's clearly written who was Christ. That He was the support. He was called as Mahāviṣhṇu. He was the support. That's the Mūlādhāra. He was the Support of the Universe.<br>
All these were all related people, but we are stupidly fighting because we do not have the Knowledge of Reality.<br>
<font color="red">So, Rādhājī wanted to give Him the name Ye-Yeśhoda. So He called Him Yesu, in Hebrew it is Jesu. Also, in India, Yeśhodā is called just as Jaśhodā.</font> [<font color="orange">unclear</font>]' many people call it Jesu. That's how He became Jesus.<br>
You can verify what I'm saying on your vibrations."<br>

"She was Rādhā. Rādhā also had a Son, and He was like an egg. And the half of the egg was Christ and half of the egg was Śhrī Gaṇeśh. But when this child was born, He started crying for His Father. Father was Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br>
It's in the ... if you need ... read Devī Māhātmyam it is there.<br>
So, always, [gestures with the two right fingers raised up:] He puts His hands like this, towards His Father. So one is, as you know, is Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's finger, another is Viṣhṇu's.<br>
And She was Rā-dhā. Rā means energy, dhā means the one who has sustained the energy.<br>
And She is the one who called Him Jesus.<br>
Actually, in the-uh-uh Hebrew it is Yesu. And also in the -- thank God, I read the Bible in Marathi, which was directly translated from Hebrew -- Yesu is the name. <font color="red">Yesu is the name of the Mother of Christ, uh, Mo... Mother of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. Yesu, means: as we call Her, Jesu or Yesu from Jesodā or Yeśhodā.<br>
From that She called Him.</font> And Christ word comes from Kṛiṣhṇa. So She called Him Krista and Yesu or Jesus.<br>
<font color="red">We, too, call Yeśhodā sometimes Jesu or Yesu.</font><br>
So She called Him by that name. And that is how She put the link for us to understand how close He was to Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa."<br>

"Ādi Viṣhṇu's eighth form was as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa during the Dwāpara Yuga, and again Ādi Śhakti took three forms. Mahākālī lived for a very short time as Viṣhṇumāyā, the infant sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. <font color="red">She was actually born as the daughter of Yeśhodā, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's foster mother, and was killed by the demon Kaṃsa.</font> She later took birth as Draupadī, wife of the Pāṇḍavas. <font color="red">Yeśhodā was Herself an Incarnation of Mahāsaraswatī.</font> As Mahālakṣhmī She took two forms, Rādhā and Rukmiṇī. '<i>Rā</i>' means power or energy and '<i>dhā</i>' means sustenance, so the name 'Rādhā' means the one who sustains the power. As Rukmiṇī She became Queen to Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, the King in Dvārakā.<br>
......<br>
Rādhā in Mary's Incarnation wanted to give Her Son the name of Her Lord, Kṛiṣhṇa. Kṛiṣhṇa comes from '<i>kṛiṣhi</i>' + '<i>\it ṇa</i>'. '<i>Kṛiṣhi</i>' means farming, '<i>ṇa</i>' means the one who carries. So the name 'Christ' came from the 'kṛiṣhi' in Kṛiṣhṇa. <font color="red">The name Jesus was derived from Jasodā, a form of Yeśhodā, the foster mother of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. Rādhā also wanted to give Yeśhodā's name to Her Son because of Yeśhodā's devotion and worship of Her in Vṛindāvan and Gokul. The abbreviation of Yeśhodā was 'Jesu' or 'Yesu', so Rādhā/Mary named Her Son Jesus Christ.</font>"<br>
