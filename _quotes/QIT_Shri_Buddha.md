"It is true that the field of human thought and action before realisation is a field of force, of tension which is generated by the bipolarity of the sun and the moon line. But, within this field of contradiction, the balanced people always look for the synthesis which will bring them closer to the Central path. <font color="red">This [is] the eight fold path described by Lord Buddha.</font>"<br>

"In the process of bettering his reflectors, he created the human being. And man alone in the entire known creation was gifted with a free moral will and a sense of discretion. Perhaps that the only way, after the ape stage, he could go further with the progress of evolution. It is thus that the human beings constitute the best reflectors of the Creator. <font color="red">Some of them as sages, like Lord Buddha, Jesus Christ, Lord Mahavir, mark the destination of human progress,</font> others as scientist discover the mighty forces of creation which are being constantly harnessed in the service of man. Similarly, some others gifted with extraordinary faculties of perception and understanding play the role of "Artists". They have not only an extra-ordinary "eye" but also an ability to communicate with others through the medium of art. They have an extremely sensitive heart and an equally eloquent medium by which they can touch the hearts of their fellowmen. This factor assumes a social importance and thus an artist plays a vital role, as member of a society."<br>

And when He was lying at the feet of a tree, in that relaxed condition, the All-pervading Mother, Holy Mother, just poured Her blessings on Him and He got Realization."</font><br>

"The essence of whatever has been described in all the religion is only one and is 'to know thyself' and to know this there is only one way that is Sahaja Yoga which may be called as spontaneous growth what happen spontaneously.<br>
<font color="red">Buddha only got it from Sahaja Yoga. He was wandering thousands of places here and there and one day while he was laying, getting tired, His Kuṇḍalinī said that, 'My son is too much tired, somehow to give Him Realization.' That very moment the rays came down to His head and stopped and from below the Kuṇḍalinī strike down His Sahasrāra and got His Realization.</font><br>
Nobody has ever got Realization without Sahaja Yoga."<br>

The founder of Jaina Dharma, Śhrī Mahāvīra and Śhrī Buddha are amongst Them. They were born of the same Mother, born of the womb of Ādi Śhakti. Try to know Their first relation that where were They born. But it was experimental for all of Them. All of Them made experiments so that human beings could cross the Void. Very few, however, could cross the Void."</font><br>

"Now, what can I say, you would be surprised, that the Shia sect that started after Muhammad Sāhab, His daughter was Fāṭimah, She was also Ādi Śhakti.<br>
<font color="red">And Her two children were, Hasan and Husayn, back then, when They saw even after the annihilation of the world, the human beings did not understand, then They were born as Buddha and Mahāvīra and They brought the non-violence as religion, and attempted that, 'Maybe with the establishment of non-violence people will achieve Self-realization.' But couldn't do it.</font>"<br>

"Shia word has been derived from Siyā. The word which come from Siyā became Shia -- Siyā means Sītājī. If you go to UP [Uttar Pradesh, India] then nobody says Sītājī, they say Siyājī, 'Siyā var Rām[a]chandra ki jay.' Everyone takes the name Siyā. She was Sītājī, Ādi Śhakti Herself.<br>
<font color="red">And Her two sons, who were Hasan and Husayn, destroyed many evils. When They ultimately died after getting tried, then in the next birth they thought of establishment of nonviolence, violence led them nowhere.<br>
They were [re]born as Mahāvīr and Buddha to make a new experiment. Experiments do happen.</font>"<br>

"You seek: first you seek in money, then in power. If in this birth any person has abundant money, then in next birth he will say, 'I do not want money, make me a minister somewhere.' Then he will seek in power. If he has not found it in power then he will seek in religion. But all of his seeking is done from outside.<br>
<font color="red">The moment he is tired of all his seeking, like Buddha also, who was tired from all corners and He laid down getting exhausted [and thought], 'No, I am not going to find it in this way. I did not get it in what I was seeking.' The moment He got tired, the very moment He was blessed and He ultimately found it. He too got it from Sahaja Yoga itself and all the Big Gurus of this world too have got it from Sahaja Yoga, everyone had achieved it through Sahaja Yoga.</font>"<br>

"Those who go to the extremes of things are also no good for Sahaja Yoga.<br>
<font color="red">Extreme takes you away from reality which was said by Gautam Buddha. He said, "Take to the mid... middle path. Keep to d... to the middle path." But His disciples have gone to the extreme path, of foolishness. He said, "Don't worship any Gods or Goddesses," at that time, because He was in Sahaja. So, His disciples started worshipping His tooth, nail, everything.</font><br>
Of course, that too has a meaning. But not for people who are not realized."<br>

"So what must we do?<br>
<font color="red">The human beings have to come to the state of Gautama who became the Buddha. He searched in all earnestness and honesty. He gave up first all fake worldly preoccupations. This is not required but when he gave up all hopes of searching, (the occupation of the mind), he accepted his defeat. He felt tired and fell at the feet of the Holy Ghost.<br>
Buddha had dharma. His body was clean, His mind, the attention, did not find any joy in the worldly greed or desire. His cup was ready and it emptied when he was tired and surrendered and that was the moment: like torrential rain, the "Shakti" filled His cup and made Him the "Shakta", the Enlightened One.</font>"<br>

<font color="red">"Such born realized people: this is a very, very far-fetched stuff; they are very few.<br>
I would say perhaps Buddha and Mahāvīra are the only two human beings who have gone through many lives. From one extreme to another They went and ultimately They found out that going to the extremes is not proper. Still They have not reached the complete height of an Incarnation."</font><br>

"Now beyond that is God's Realization.<br>
There are three stages to that also, but just now I have told this: the Sat-chit-ānand State.<br>
<font color="red">The God's Realization is the state in which Gautama Buddha and Mahāvīra only rose, and They are settled down here in our brains, both of Them are here, Christ is here.<br>
And these two were not Incarnations. They were born as human beings. They were born to Sītā, as Lav and Kuśh. Then they were born as Buddha and Mahāvīra and Ādi Śhakti was their mother again. Then they were born to Fāṭimah Bi as Hasan and Husayn. They are both placed here in your head and They are the two milestones you have got by which you can know what a human being can rise up to.<br>
Now today they are like Incarnations. Incarnations are beyond but maybe the gap can be bridged.</font>"<br>

In Sahaja Yoga we have all of Them, absolutely activating your Kuṇḍalinī. Everybody in Sahaja Yoga knows so much about Them, and the most important thing is that They are all with us, They are part and parcel of us and They are not separated by anything. They were working the same process in history, and now we are working it out in the present with all of Them."</font><br>

"All the religions from ancient times have said that a man or a woman has to cleanse their mind through religious activity, with righteous thinking. The aim of every religion was to establish balance in every way to make way for the ascent of the seeker. <font color="red">The Second Birth, Walīhood, Selfhood, Buddha's State, Jaini State, Gnostic, or Ātma-sākṣhātkār, are all names for Self-realization.</font> It was all right in the olden days, where people wanted to be good and to ascend. They obeyed and tried to do whatever was asked for by the Saints, Prophets or Incarnations.<br>
......<br>
On the whole, if you see, Western culture denies Christ who sacrificed his life for the sins of the people. Those who call themselves Christians indulge in all kinds of activities which are anti-Christ. When Christ came into this world in the Realm of Divinity, one had to go through penance (tapasyā). <font color="red">Buddha and Mahāvīra had to do the same at that time.</font> Christians do not know what is penance and they cannot sacrifice even a pin for others. They are very good at lip service. Big conferences are held in the developing nations for monetary help, who pay for these conferences and the outcome is that nothing can be done for the poor countries while Westerners spend their superfluous money on all kinds of waste.<br>
......<br>
Now, a few words about Buddhism. <font color="red">Lord Buddha talked about compassion, compassion and compassion. He bore all the troubles of those days and at the end of his life he was in a very bad financial condition and ultimately he died in a very remote corner of India. Lord Buddha's life has been really ideal but people believe that you cannot attain spiritual ascent unless and until you suffer like Him and give up everything the way He had given it up.</font> The ascetic concept is that one has to give up the family, one has to give up money, property, all possessions, one has to give up the normal life that one leads and has to be an absolute celibate in order to move on the spiritual path. But there are Buddhists and Buddhists. Most of their different forms are lost in ritualism or mental meditation. The Japanese follow the Zen system without understanding anything about it. <font color="red">They have built a beautiful temple of Buddha in Bodhi Gayā where Buddha got his Nirvāṇa.</font> When Genghis Khān invaded Behar, the Buddhist monks did not resort to violence and died. Another style of Buddhism is that of the Japanese who had to learn a lesson through the extreme suffering of Hiroshima.<br>
The Dalai Lamas preach nonviolence, but they have been very money or gold-oriented people. In Beijing, one can see thousands of gold plates and gold beer mugs with Pali inscriptions in the secret vaults. It is said they were rescued from a river by the Chinese soldiers who went after Mister [Dalai] Lama and his followers who were running away to India and who dumped part of the gold they were carrying in the river. This was rescued and put in the museum. They wear saffron clothes to show that they are saṃnyāsīs but live like lords in Dharmaśhālā. I met such a Canadian saṃnyāsī in Canada and he told me that he had no other clothes but these. He said he lost all his property to Dalai Lama who begs all over the world. In Dharmaśhālā, there was a great protest against these very aggressive Dalai Lama's people, but many Governments have sympathy for this money-oriented (gold-oriented), spiritual head, so to pacify these ignorant Governments, who do not discriminate between truth and hypocrisy, the protesters had to ask for forgiveness.<br>
As it is, India has a large load of refugees and they cannot afford to have these gold-oriented saṃnyāsīs which have created a diplomatic rift between China and India. There are Buddhists in Nepal who believe in black magic. Many seekers go to Nepal and get lost. Buddhist Lamas are of many kinds. Some of them have monasteries where to raise the Kuṇḍalinī the seekers are beaten on the spinal cord till their backs are broken. In China they also worship Mother Mercy, Kuan Yin [Guānyīn], who was a Chinese Incarnation. <font color="red">Lord Buddha has given three mantras to chant: to surrender to Lord Buddha or a realized Soul; surrender to dharma (morality); surrender to collectivity.</font> They use a noisy wail to chant mantras. <font color="red">Like all other religious Incarnations he has talked of "Maitreya", is a future Buddha who will give liberation. "Maitreya" means that three Mothers together will incarnate to give Nirvāṇa.</font>"<br>
