<b>Version 1:</b>
<font color="DarkRed">"Many Seers had announced about this era [time]. Recently, saw William Blake's book called Milton. He was very philosophical and in His prediction He mentioned the place where Sahaja Yoga started (Surrey Hills) and the place where the foundation of the first center was established (Lambeth Vale), writing about both places is very surprising. It is also written that a common person will be becoming a Preṣhit (Prophet), who will be bestowed with special power. With this amazing power he will create many more Preṣhit [Prophets]. After reading this so deep and so correct information about Sahaja Yoga in His poem felt tremendous joy. If our country's Sahaja Yogis' also be aware of this knowledge[,] then recognizing the greatness and accepting the depth of this greatness will be their great responsibility."</font><br>

<b>Version 1:</b>
<font color="DarkRed">"This yuga was predicted by many great people. Recently, I saw the book Milton written by William Blake. He was a great philosopher and it's so surprising how he predicted the foundations of Sahaja Yoga (Surrey Hills) and the first Sahaja centre (Lambeth Vale). He also wrote that with a special power, ordinary people will become a Preṣhit (Prophet), who will be bestowed with special power. With this amazing power he will create many more Preṣhit [Prophets]. And with this wonderful power they will liberate many others. I enjoyed very much his poem that had such depth and such clear knowledge. If only the Sahaja Yogis of our country could become aware and alert towards this kind of knowledge, then they will aim at achieving the greatness and the depth of Sahaja Yoga."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"There's one more thing: I was happy to learn that the great poet of this country, Blake, had prophesied about Me.<br>
And it is so beautifully done, that He said that: "England is going to be the Jerusalem." We, this is going to be the pilgrimage. The venue has shifted.<br>
And then He has very beautifully -- have you got the thing to read? No. You haven't brought [it].<br>
But what reading! That: He has said that first thing furnace will be burning in Surrey Hills, where I came first, and then He has mentioned Lambeth Vale, where we have got our Āśhram. Where the foundations will be laid, we have laid the foundations.<br>
And that Jerusalem is going to be in England, not in India. And you are the people responsible for this Jerusalem."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"This process has now started on an en masse scale and is the fulfillment of William Blake's most heartfelt desire: "would that all God's people were Prophets". In this age of Kṛita Yuga, through the compassion of the Paramachaitanya (or Divine Love), the Kuṇḍalinī is being raised in countless human beings, so that it is actually happening: God's people have become Prophets and, what is more, they have powers to make others Prophets too.<br>
......<br>
Most of the seekers that I met during that time told me that, although they knew they were looking for something, they were completely ignorant of what it was and had been mesmerized by these negative and false teachers. I have to say that it is truly lamentable the way earnest seekers have been exploited by these horrible so-called gurus from India. For seekers are a special category of people and, as such, they are very precious. William Blake describes them as "men of God". They are the ones who have been seeking in many lifetimes to find the Divine and have often become lost in the web of words of false ideas ("śhabda jālam" in Sanskrit, as described by Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya).<br>
......<br>
On the firm foundation of Absolute Truth only, can one have complete confidence and an absolutely peaceful, nonviolent stand in the face of the relative world of uncertainty, contradiction and confusion. Such a person, like William Blake, for example, is truly what is meant by the word Saint -- a person who states the truth simply as he sees it with his higher vision, and does not react vehemently or violently to contradiction and scorn, but pities his or her aggressors as blind and ignorant.<br>
......<br>
Of course, modern art can also have a very evolved manifestation if it is emitted from the formless Spirit. It breaks the lines and forms of conventional art to create a formless substance which is full of light and transparent meaning. But to achieve this potential, one has to be a realized Soul, who can paint his formless joy in such a way as to represent and emit that abstract spontaneous enjoyment of the Spirit by the Spirit. Such art requires no commentary and no discussion. Only a poet can describe it. A poet like William Blake, who was a great evolved Soul and Seer, could also draw and paint the visions He describes in His poetry. The imagination of such poets touches all the beautiful heights that only an enlightened Soul can appreciate and enjoy. All those evolved souls, whether they are sitting in a simple village weaving a shawl for the Goddess, or singing the praise of the Eternal and Everlasting in divine poetry, or playing the divine music, are all the Creator's own Divine Ripples. They may sometimes not be understood, they may be criticized by ignorant, blind people, but they work and sing and play for themselves and for those who have Divine Knowledge and who can understand the world they portray."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"These are the seekers all over the world. What they are seeking is the peace of their own mind. It is a good news for such people that a unique discovery has been found out by which one can achieve the peace within. One has to go beyond the mind. This was very old knowledge in the East, especially in India, and there were Seers in the West who also knew about this knowledge by which one can achieve that state of Self-realization. In England William Blake, Molière in France, de Maupassant in France, and many other poets like C.S. Lewis, and certain persons in America, have been endowed with this future vision of divine life entering into human beings."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Do the Āratī with the children, have lots of music to develop their sense of rhythm and how to sing. It is important to sing in tune. No dreamy airy-fairy world. Don't let them float about. Give them reality. They can be poets, but use real images like Blake did."</font><br>
