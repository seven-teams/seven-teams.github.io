<font color="red">"His Power Rādhā was then divided into two, that is, Rukmiṇī in Dvārika and Rādhā in Vṛindāvan. It is very humanly."</font><br>

"The place of Nagpur is very high, in My point of view Nagpur is Nābhī of the whole world. So you understand it that how much carefully and how properly Nagpurians have to live and should behave and how wisely they should think! Whereas whole world is afraid of Nagpurians!<br>
Once I went to Lata Mangeshkar and asked her to come to a program. She replied, "No question of me, I will not allow even anybody else to go there. Once I went there, they threw shoes at me."<br> 
Another person also had same experience.<br>
I said, "I am going to My parent's place."<br> 
<font color="red">They got Me down halfway in Badnera [Kuṇḍina], where Rukmiṇī Haraṇ took place and they brought Me here stealthily in the same way [Rukmiṇī Haraṇ] saying that, "Don't go there otherwise people will throw stones at you." "</font><br>

"Viśhuddhi chakra has two other points, which are very important, within us.<br> 
I take this up because you people are suffer[ing] from left Viśhuddhi.<br>
Left Viśhuddhi is on the left-hand side, and right [is] on the right-hand side.<br> 
<font color="red">Right-hand side Viśhuddhi is the Viśhuddhi when ... when He was the king and called as Viṭṭhala and His wife Rukmiṇī</font> [<font color="orange">unclear</font>]."<br>

<font color="red"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> Like Kṛiṣhṇa's case, you see, Kṛiṣhṇa had it Sixteen Thousand Powers and He got them, they were born in India as women. Ah but He couldn't keep it them in the house because everybody would say that, `They ... they are His keeps,' you see. So He made one king uh-uh ...<br>
<b>Grégoire de Kalbermatten:</b> You come [<font color="orange">unclear</font>].<br>
<font color="red"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> ... to capture them, all these sixteen thousands, and keep them in the house, you see, in his arrest. So, Kṛiṣhṇa defeated him and got all of them, and married them! [Drinks tea during translation.]<br>
<font color="red">And He had five, five elements also which He kuh tried to incarnate, and then He married too as five, His wives, His queens.</font><br>
And He was called as Yogeśhwara.<br>
<b>Grégoire de Kalbermatten:</b> Mother, sorry I am not sure: did You say that He married the five elements?<br>
<font color="red"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font><font color="red"> Five elements: they were called His five wives, they were five elements.</font><br>
<b>Grégoire de Kalbermatten:</b> Who were they, Mother?<br>
<font color="red"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> <font color="red"> You see, there were five of them Kālī and all that. There are five of them: Rukmiṇī, and all these five of them. [Smiles.] He had five queens!</font><br> 
But after all He was, you have Virāṭa, you see. [Laughing:] Imagine, He has to have all these powers."<br>

"On the right side of the Viśhuddhi resides Kṛiṣhṇa, who in Maharashtra is known as Viṭṭhala and who ruled over Dvārika, which is in your city. When He is in the center, He is in the form of Gopi-Gopika, when He was ruling Dvārika He was on the right side, and on the left His Power is that of a woman who was His sister. <font color="red">Rādhā was His Power in the center, and Rukmiṇī, His wife, was His power on the right side."</font><br>

"<font color="red">So, for the right Viśhuddhi we use the mantra of Viṭṭhala and Rakhumāī [Rukmiṇī], these two persons.</font><br>
You see, it is very significant that also.<br>
Because they say that there was a Puṇḍarīkākṣh, one boy, who was serving his parents. "<font color="red">And his parents were sleeping, he was pressing their feet, when Viṭṭhala and His Power Rakhumāī ... Rukmiṇī, They appeared uh in the door. But he said, ``Now keep quiet. My parents are sleeping, so You stay there!" So he had one brick near him which he threw, and asked Them, ``You stay on that." So They kept quiet. They kept quiet because they are sleeping."</font><br> 
Now, this is the thing is: on the right side, if you are talking loudly, if you talk too much, uh-uh-uh-uh if you uh intimidate people with your talking, then you catch on right Viśhuddhi.<br>
So for that, best is to take some rest, and give some rest to your right Viśhuddhi, by stopping your talk. `Go into mauna,' they say: just don't talk. For some time if you don't taulk [talk], you'll see that your Viśhuddhi will be improved, your problems will be improved."<br>

"During the Dwāpara Yuga at the time of Lord Kṛiṣhṇa, Ādi Śhakti again incarnated as three separate human personalities, expressing Her three aspects:<br>
<br>
......<br>
<font color="red">2. Rukmiṇī (Mahāsaraswatī) as Kṛiṣhṇa's Queen"</font><br>

"Ādi Viṣhṇu's eighth form was as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa during the Dwāpara Yuga, and again Ādi Śhakti took three forms. Mahākālī lived for a very short time as Viṣhṇumāyā, the infant sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. She was actually born as the daughter of Yeśhodā, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's foster mother, and was killed by the demon Kaṃsa. She later took birth as Draupadī, wife of the Pāṇḍavas. Yeśhodā was Herself an Incarnation of Mahāsaraswatī. <font color="red">As Mahālakṣhmī She took two forms, Rādhā and Rukmiṇī.</font> '<i>Rā</i>' means power or energy and '<i>dhā</i>' means sustenance, so the name 'Rādhā' means the one who sustains the power. <font color="red">As Rukmiṇī She became Queen to Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, the King in Dvārakā.</font>"<br>
