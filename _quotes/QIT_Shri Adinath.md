"Dattātreya is the innocence of all these Three Powers.<br>
And this Guru uh was the One whose ... who then had a big tradition of Gurus.<br>
In the same tradition, we had many Gurus in our country. And, specially, in the area near Bombay [Mumbai], which is called as Maharashtra, they came as Nāth. They are, they were called as Nāth.<br>
<font color="red">So the first one was Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], then ahh Dattātreya, then Macchindranāth, then Gorakhnāth, like that a tradition of these Gurus came.</font><br>
But all their knowledge was kept as a guarded secret. It was a Gupta Vidyā. Is absolutely guarded secret: secret knowledge about Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
They never talked about it, they never told about it. Because they thought: that, 'Just now, let us experiment with it fully, and then we will give some idea about it to people.' "<br>

"For example, we can say the gree... green thing is the one that represents the water, water element. This center the ... in the stomach is the water element within us. It is called as Nābhī chakra, and around it is called as the Bhavasāgara, you can say the Void, or you can say the Gap, or whatever you may say, the whole world as such, within us. So, the people who were born on this center, around this center, were born out of water element.<br>
<font color="red">In this Bhavasāgara -- oc... Bhavasāgara means the ocean of this world -- were born, through this ocean of the world, were born all the Primordial Masters, one after another. We can say Abraham, Moses, we had Janaka, were Ādināth, and Socrates, and so many others like that, Nāṇaka, and also very recently, we had about hundred years back, a very great Saint born in India known as Sāī Nāth.<br>
They all represent the same element that is the water element. Being responsible or being born out of that, They are anxious to maintain water element as the one which is within us for sustaining ourselves. We su... we are sustained by water, so They help us to sustain ourselves. They are the sustainers: They tell us how to sustain us as a human being.<br>
And all of Them have tried to establish religion within us.</font><br>
A religion doesn't mean outside, but the religion as a man: means the capacity of a man, or you can say the quality of a man. What a human being should be like, what is the way to know if he is a human being or not, which is described in al... in the Ten Commandments."<br>

"Now, all the Gurus, all the Gurus who came, say from ... we can start from Socrates, then Abraham, Moses, this is the Guru Tattwa, is the Principle of Master, Primordial Masters. The Principle is born again and again.<br>
<font color="red">In India we can say the Ādināth, we had one Ādināth, the Guru long time back.</font> Then we had Dattātreya, we had uh Janaka, Nāṇaka, Sāī Nāth.<br>
We had in the Middle East Muhammad Sāhab, Lao Tze in China, Confucius.<br>
All these Great Principles of Gurus who were born, They had one job to do is to establish your dharma. Their job was not to give you Realization."<br>

"But with you I have to request you to think about it and to put your attention to it. And you'll be amazed, when you will know about it, that how much a chastity of a woman is important and graceful and energy-giving to her and to the whole society, to her own brother, to her own father, mother and everyone, to her children, because she is the one, really, who is the śhakti. And if she starts frittering away her śhakti like this, then the śhakti of the whole community, the whole country disappears.<br>
<font color="red">And that is why all the Gurus, right from Ādināth, or you can say Ādi Guru, up to, you can say, Moses and [A]braham and Muhammad Sāhab and all these people, have been so particular on this poaint ... point that even Muhammad Sāhab said, "Supposing there are too many women, then you can marry four times."</font> Doesn't mean that every Muslim should marry. But it was [laughing:] meaning that there were too many women on those days, so He said, "All right, but marry them!" "<br>

"Here [turning and pointing towards the Chakra Chart:] the Guru Tattwa is expressed in the Void, there, where the Ten Gurus actually incarnated basically and they re-incarnated. <font color="red">Say we can start uh-uh from Ādināth.</font> Then we can come to ... other ones, uh-uh-uh ... like Nāṇaka, Janaka. Janaka was-ss much earlier. Then we can say Abraham, Moses-s-s. All these were Guru Tattwa, Socrates. All these were Guru Tattwa people: the people who came as Prophets.

Till the time of Gyāneśhwara, that's in the twelfth century.<br>
Gyāneśhwara was the disciple of His own brother, Nivṛuttināth. And They suffered a lot. And He asked Nivṛuttināth for one permission: that, "Let Me open the Truth to the public. Just I'll tell about it! I'll not do anything, I'll just tell about it."<br>
Because thirteen, fourteen thousand years back Mārkaṇḍeya has described about Kuṇḍalinī. Then came ... Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya has described about Kuṇḍalinī.<br>

"Maheśha (Śhiva), Viṣhṇu and Brahmadeva form the Trinity which incarnated as one teacher God, the Primordial Master, Dattātreya. He came onto this Earth to teach people the secrets of the Divine, to reveal God, and to help them cross the Ocean of Illusion themselves within their own identity. Evolution could not go further in the hands of human beings who were in the bondage of ignorance, so they were given guidance through this Incarnation of the Primordial Master (Ādi Guru) again and again in different lives. He was created as the three-headed child, Dattātreya, by Ādi Śhakti who appeared on Earth during the Tretā Yuga as Satī Anasūyā, wife of the Sage Atreya. <font color="red">He was born as Ādināth who founded Jainism -- one of the oldest religions.</font> Then he was born as Rāja Janaka, father of Jānakī also called Sītā, Rāma's wife. She was an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti.<br>
The Primordial Master was also born as Macchindranāth, and again as Zoroaster who was worshiped by the ancient Persians, and still revered by Parsis. Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism. In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates. He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā). Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918. Altogether there were ten major Avatāras of Dattātreya."<br>

"In this Void is placed the Primordial Master (Ādi Guru) formed from Brahmā, Viṣhṇu and Maheśha (Śhiva).
