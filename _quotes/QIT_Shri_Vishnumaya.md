<font color="red">"But even, you see, this same Gāṃdhārī, the one who has done this, who was a very powerful woman during the time of Kṛiṣhṇa. And she told Kṛiṣhṇa that, "You are Viṣhṇumāyā! You are the One who is this. You can take birth many [a] time. But the way You have killed all my hundred child of mine, You've finished my complete uh-uh-uh dynasty, no more Kauravas left on this Earth. In the same way Your dynasty will be finished."

<font color="red">"Now, if you have that enlightened faith, enlightened faith in you, you become powerful. You are powerless because [gesturig wobbling with the right hand:] your faith is like this. But if you become really a[n] evolved, matured, realized Soul, then all your powers will work.<br>
There's a fisherman in India ... [after 17 seconds (durig which She drinks whater):] who is, I mean is ... he's a graduate, though he's a fisherman. So, [laughing:] one day [in 1981], he was going on a boat to another island [village of Sakhar] to do Sahaja Yogaa. And when he came out of his hut he found huge, big clouds, black ones, hovering, and the Viṣhṇumāyā playing. Just he stood on the shore, and told Viṣhṇumāyā: "Please tell these clouds to behave themselves! I am going for the work of Mother, and dare not trouble me on the way!" Just stop it.<br>
The people who were with him told Me that this Hariśhchandra [Koli] was talking like that.<br>
They got into the boat, they did the program, came home. When he went into his boat [bed], uh rain started.<br>
So you control all five elements by your enlightened faith. For which, you don't even have to say anything: the powers are so great that they act. "</font><br>

<font color="red">"During the Dwāpara Yuga at the time of Lord Kṛiṣhṇa, Ādi Śhakti again incarnated as three separate human personalities, expressing Her three aspects:<br>
......<br>
&emsp;3. Viṣhṇumāyā (Mahākālī) as sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. She lived but for a short time. She later took birth as Draupadī, wife of the Pāṇḍavas."</font><br>

<font color="red">"Ādi Viṣhṇu's eighth form was as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa during the Dwāpara Yuga, and again Ādi Śhakti took three forms. Mahākālī lived for a very short time as Viṣhṇumāyā, the infant sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. She was actually born as the daughter of Yeśhodā, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's foster mother, and was killed by the demon Kaṃsa. She later took birth as Draupadī, wife of the Pāṇḍavas. Yeśhodā was Herself an Incarnation of Mahāsaraswatī. As Mahālakṣhmī She took two forms, Rādhā and Rukmiṇī. '<i>Rā</i>' means power or energy and '<i>dhā</i>' means sustenance, so the name 'Rādhā' means the one who sustains the power. As Rukmiṇī She became Queen to Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, the King in Dvārakā."</font><br>
