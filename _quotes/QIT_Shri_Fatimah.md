"<font color="red">Now, what can I say, you would be surprised, that the Shia sect that started after Muhammad Sāhab, His daughter was Fāṭimah, She was also Ādi Śhakti.<br>
And Her two children were, Hasan and Husayn, back then, when They saw even after the annihilation of the world, the human beings did not understand, then They were born as Buddha and Mahāvīra and They brought the non-violence as religion, and attempted that, 'Maybe with the establishment of non-violence people will achieve Self-realization.'</font> But couldn't do it."<br>

"<font color="red">After the birth of the daughter of Muhammad Sāhab, as I talked yesterday also, there was beginning of the caste Shia in Islam.</font><br>
Shia word has been derived from Siyā. The word which come from Siyā became Shia -- Siyā means Sītājī. If you go to UP [Uttar Pradesh, India] then nobody says Sītājī, they say Siyājī, 'Siyā var Rām[a]chandra ki jay.' Everyone takes the name Siyā. She was Sītājī, Ādi Śhakti Herself.<br>
<font color="red">And Her two sons, who were Hasan and Husayn, destroyed many evils.</font> When They ultimately died after getting tried, then in the next birth they thought of establishment of nonviolence, violence led them nowhere.<br>
They were [re]born as Mahāvīr and Buddha to make a new experiment. Experiments do happen."<br>

It is only possible through Sahaja Yoga to realize that this is the Truth, this is the fact."<br>

"Now, beyond that is God's Realization.<br>
There are three stages to that also, but just now I have told this: the Sat-chit-ānand State.<br>
The God's Realization is the state in which Gautam Buddha and Mahāvīra only rose, and They are settled down here in our brains, both of Them are here, Christ is here.<br>
And these two were not Incarnations: They were born as human beings. They were born to Sītā, as Lav and Kuśh. Then they were born as Buddha and Mahāvīra. Then Ādi Śhakti was Their mother again. <font color="red">Then they were born to Fāṭimah Bi as Hasan and Husayn.</font><br>
They are both placed here, in your head.<br>
And They are the two milestones you have got, by which you can know what a human being can rise up to that now today They are like Incarnations. Incarnations are beyond, but maybe the gap can be bri... bridged."<br>

"Now in this Void we have two great entities as well which we know as Chandra [Moon] and Sūrya [Sun]. Moon and Sun are such chakras which reside on these nāḍīs here and here.<br>
On these chakras there are two very great personalities who have been appointed. They are complete embodiment of human beings. They are like humans, in fact are humans. Out of these one is Buddha and one is Mahāvīra.<br>
But if you listen to the whole history of Their lives, then these are two sons which Śhrī Sītā had as Lav and Kuśha who is completely in human form. And after They evolved to the level that They are here as Buddha and Mahāvīra. There also they thought They have reached an extreme of nonviolence because the supports of nonviolence came in and started protecting even mosquitoes and bugs.<br>
Then They again took birth and came at the time of Muhammad. <font color="red">Muhammad was an Incarnation of Śhrī Janaka and His daughter Fāṭimah Bi was also Incarnation of Śhrī Sītā.<br>
Then, as Their sons as Hasan and Husayn, They gave Their life in Karbalāʾ to prove that no kind of extreme is good.</font><br>
And this thing is Truth or not you can see on your vibrations. If [one thinks that] I am lying, then through your vibrations you would know that not even one single word is a lie here that I am telling you."<br>

"Those who are here and Buddha and Mahāvīr are here, sitting on our foreheads. Buddha and Mahāvīr are not someone else, [but] Luv and Kuśh, whom you call, Their names are Luv and Kuśh. They are the ones who take birth in Their world multiple times. They came into the world under the names of Buddha and Mahāvīr.<br>
Consider Them as Incarnations only. They are a special being who take incarnation from humans.<br>
He came into the world and preached non-violence. But His non-violence was not like the Jains, who say, 'Take care of the ants, take care of the mosquitoes.'<br>
So then He said, "Take birth again." I don't know what drama He created, so then He took birth as Hasan and Husayn.<br>
<font color="red">Their mother, who was Sītājī, was also Jānakī, was also Rādhā, She is also called Fāṭimah. And Her place is in the left navel.</font><br>

"You see, there are four types of Incarnations.<br>
One is the Incarnation of the Mother, all right? She can be a wife [mother] or a brother [sister], of a Guru. She can be a wife, [but] never a wife of a Guru. As a daughter of a Guru. <font color="red">It's a, like Muhammad Sāhab's daughter, Fāṭimah, was Ādi Śhakti Herself.</font>"<br>

" 'Keep your body all right,' 'Don't overdo things,' 'Keep a moderate life,' 'Lead a normal life,' that's what Buddha has told you. There is no need to go to extremes for anything!<br>
But even Buddhist[s], they have gone to another extreme, so He had to come on this Earth as Śhaṅkarāchārya to tell people, "What are you doing? When did I say this‽"<br>
<font color="red">Then they were born as the sons of Fāṭimah Bi, who was Herself nothing else but Jānakī, and They were Her sons Hasan and Husayn, who had preached nonviolence and They saw that people were trying to save uh-uh-uh ... bugs and mosquitoes.</font><br>
You know, there are some funny cults where we are so particular of bugs, mosquitoes and all the worms. We are not at all particular about human beings. They, I don't know what am I going to do with bugs? Am I going to give them Realization? Even chickens, am I going to give them Realization? I have to give Realization to human beings! What is the need to pay so much attention to these nonsensical things? To save the bugs and save the mosquitoes and make them bite a Brahmin, pay him money, because they think they have done a great kalyāṇa on the bugs. Perhaps they might have been bugs, in last lives, the way they are interested in all these mosquitoes. [Laughter.]<br>
Now, these two were born as Hasan and Husayn and to get rid of these ideas of nonviolence, they had this Karbalāʾ, in which They fought and died like great śhūras [warriors for good, brave men].<br>
This is the story of Great Incarnations on this Earth."<br>

"And from Sahaja Yoga how do you cure? It is very simple. Put your left hand towards the Photograph and put your right hand on your spleen and turn it, and say, "Mother, You are the Gṛuhalakṣhmī."<br>
<font color="red">Now Gṛuhalakṣhmī was Fāṭimah Bi, who was the daughter of Muhammad Sāheb and She was ... She never went out, She never went out. She kept inside the house and She made Her children so great, two children who fought Their way and the husband also, and They died in that big war of Karbalāʾ. And She stayed at home.<br>
The whole Power was inside. She never went out. She used always that, what you call, completely covered, 'burqa', you see.<br>
She is the one who is the complete Gṛuhalakṣhmī among all the Lakṣhmīs. Like you can say Sītā was Mahālakṣhmī, but She was Gṛuhalakṣhmī. Just kept Herself.<br>
Nobody knows much about Her, but She is the one who created this Shia, Shia you see.</font><br>
Surprising, that Sītājī is called is called as Shia in the villages and some people who do not pronounce, say Shia.<br>
<font color="red">So the pure Gṛuhalakṣhmī was Fāṭimah Bi."</font><br>

The wife also has to be a Gṛuhalakṣhmī as I told you.<br>
Then you have your food properly. Sit down and eat properly.<br>
But no! Just after that, upsetting that Nābhī, you jump into your car, taking your breakfast in your hand, eating on the way, honking at people, getting angry with them. The wife is calling, "Come along! You had no breakfast!", nothing doing! You are on your way on a special work.<br>

She killed the demons, single-handed, She took upon Herself the responsibility of making the people cross the Bhavasāgara.<br>

And then She took a milder form of Incarnation. <font color="red">Even during the time of all the Gurus, She took the Form of, as you know: Jānakī was the daughter of Janaka, then Fāṭimah was the daughter of Muhammad Sāhab, and Nāṇakī was the sister of Nāṇaka.</font> In those Forms, these Powers s... sustained and nourished the Guru Tattwa.

Sītā was Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī, and She was the daughter of Janaka. Then the sister of Śhrī Nāṇaka, Nāṇakī, She was Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī. Her relation was of sister. <font color="red">In the same way, the daughter of Muhammad Sāhib, Fāṭimah, She was Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī.</font><br>

<font color="red">"Today we are going to have the Pūjā of Fāṭimah Bi, who was the symbol of Gṛuhalakṣhmī. And so we are going to have the Pūjā of the Gṛuhalakṣhmī Principle within us.<br>
As the housewife has to finish every work, everything in the household, and then she goes for a bath, in the same way this morning, I had to do lots of things. And then I could come for your Pūjā. Because today the housewife's jobs were many, so I had to finish them like a good housewife.<br>
Now, the Principle of Gṛuhalakṣhmī has been evolved and developed by the Divine: is not a human beings' creation. And as you know, it resides in the left Nābhī.<br>
The Gṛuhalakṣhmī is the one that is represented in the life of Fāṭimah, who was the daughter of Muhammad Sāhab.<br>
Now She is always born in a relationship, to a Guru, which is of virginity, of purity. So She comes as a sis-ter or She comes as a daughter.<br>
Now the beauty of Fāṭimah's life is: that after the death of Muhammad Sāhab, as usual, there were fanatic people who thought they can take the religion into their hands, and can make it a very fanatic thing. And the attention was not paid so much towards the ascent of the person.<br>
Even Muhammad Sāhab has described His son-in-law in many ways. And He is the only One, or there's another Incarnation, of Brahmadeva, who came on this Earth, ʿAlī, came on this Earth. He was the Incarnation of Brahmadeva, and His another Incarn-nation [Incarnation] was Sopāndev, which ... you can go to Poona [Pune], you can see the temple of Sopāndev there.<br>
......<br>
So, we have ʿAlī and His wife Fāṭimah who incarnated on the Principle of the left Nābhī.<br>
She stayed in Her house, in Her household, and She observed, what you call, a kind of a pardā [veil] or naqab [mask] as they call it, to cover Her face-ss. Is a symbol that a woman who is a housewife has to save her chastity by covering her face, because She was a beautiful woman and They were born in a country which was very, very voilent [violent], and She would have been definitely attacked in case She had not lived in that kind of fashion.<br>
As you know, in the time of Christ, though Mary was Mahālakṣhmī's Incarnation, had to be very-very potential personality. And Christ did not want anybody to know what She was.<br>
But though She was in the house, She was Śhakti. So She allowed Her sons, or actually ordered Them, to fight those fanatics-s-s who were trying to deny the authority of Her husband. And you know They, Hasan and Husayn, They were killed there.<br>
It's a very beautiful thing how the Mahālakṣhmī Tattwa of Sītā took a form of Viṣhṇumāyā, just to establish the beautiful Principle of ... a Housewife.<br>
Now She was very powerful, no doubt! And She knew that Her children will be killed.<br>
But these people are never killed, They never die, nor do They suffer! Is a drama They had to play to show people how stupid they are.<br>
Bur [but] as a ... as a result of that, another system started where they respected Saints.<br>
Like in India, Shia people respect uh Auliyās, or we can call them the people who are realized Souls, like Nizamuddin Sāhab. Then we have got in ... Chisti, uh-uh-uh we have got in Ajmer [Rajasthan], uh-uh-uh Hazarat Chisti.<br>
All these great Saints were respected by Shias.<br>
But still, they could not transcend the limits of a religiosity. So, they also became extremely fanatic.<br>
Firstly they would not uh-uh see to another r-religion where they had Saints, they would not respect the Saints who were belonged to another religion.<br>
And even when we had a Great Saint like Sāī Nāth of Śhirḍī, who was a Muslim to begin with, and it is said that Fāṭimah Herself brought Him as a child in Her lap and gave Him to some lady. Is said so. We did not deny, as far as the Hindus were concerned, His Saintliness, but the Muslims-ss did not accept Him.<br>
There's another one called Haji Malang, who is very near Bombay [Mumbai], who was a realized Soul [Bābā Abdur Rehman Malang, a Sufi Saint who came to India in the 12th century A.D. from the Middle East, whose dargah is in Kalyan in Thane]. He, too, realized the fanaticism of the Su... Shias.<br>"</font><br>

"We the Sahaja Yogis have our duties to bring the light of the Deities in our attention. We need to see what Śhrī Rāma did, if there were some difficulties how would Śhrī Sītā reacted, what She would have said. If we start thinking like Her all the women will be good Gṛuhalakṣhmīs.<br>
<font color="red">As you know Śhrī Sītā took many forms, one of them is of Gṛuhalakṣhmī in the form of Śhrī Fāṭimah. She was in the house covered in chādar but She did all the dhārmik works.</font><br>
For this you don't need to go out and start giving lectures and become big leaders, this is not necessary, staying at home also you can do the dhārmik work, take care of your children and the people around you and speak to them about Sahaja Yoga, later on it can be in your surroundings. But before that you have to imbibe the qualities of Śhrī Sītā within you."<br>

"What is the duty of Sahaja Yogis' life? We have to bring the light of God in our attention.<br>
We must see and behave as Śhrī Rāma. What would Śhrī Rāma or Sītā do in this situation? What would Sītājī say? How would Sītā behave?<br>
She is also Gṛuhalakṣhmī. As you know Sītājī took many births. <font color="red">Gṛuhalakṣhmī was in the form of Fāṭimah Bi. She was humbly in the house but all dharma was done by Her power. Not necessary for Her to go out and give big lectures.</font><br>
You can do that work at home with children, relatives and friends. You can spread Sahaja Yoga at the house. After getting all of it you can go out to society.<br>

"<font color="red">Today is a very joyous that all of us are here, in Turkey, to celebrate the Pūjā to Fāṭimah's.<br>
As you know about Her that She was the daughter of Muhammad Sāhab, and was married to ʿAlī, and She had two children, Hasan and Husayn, who were ultimately killed in Karbalāʾ by the fanatics, who were, that time, called themselves Sunnis.</font><br> 
......<br>
<font color="red">Fāṭimah lost Her two children, and She was the Embodiment of Gṛuhalakṣhmī.<br>
She resides in our left Nābhī. So for all the diseases that are connected with the spleen, all the problems that are connected with your left Nābh... Nābhī, can be only done .. collor ... corrected by Fāṭimah.<br>
So you have to keep Fāṭimah awakened within yourself.</font><br>
That we are here in the Islamic culture, orwe can say this is place of Islamic culture. And in the Islamic culture a housewife was given a very-very important place.<br>
At the time of Muhammad Sāhab there were struggles and fights and wars going on between different tribes. As a result, many, many young men were killed. Only quite old people survived. And also, so many women. This is the reason why other Muhammad said that: "You can marry four wives, five wives, but you cannot allow them to remain unmarried, or they will have extramarital relationships with you." That will be the biggest fall for Islam, for that religion." So, He understood that, unless and until women are kept absolutely chaste, absolutely pure, there cannot be the Kingdom of God.<br>
In Sanskrit there's a saying: "Yatra narya[sty] pujyante, tatra ramante Devatā" [part of Manusmṛiti 3.56 with inversion of "ramante tatra"], meaning: "Where the women are respected, are worshiped, and they are worshipful" -- not that they are to be worshiped, but they are respectable -- "there only exists the Kingdom of God."<br>
So, so much responsibility is on women.<br>
<font color="red">So, from Fāṭimah's life we have to know that She did not go out of Her house, and She remained a housewife. And She made Her two children grow up in such a manner that They had to fight the war against fanaticism.</font> Her husband also was there.<br> 
This is how a woman of a housewife is shown to be so powerful, that though she's in the house, though she's ... looks to be just a mother, but how powerful she is!
......<br>
The men, as a whole, are very different type, you must understand. They are extroverts, and whatever the women care too much for, they do not. It's all right, because-s-s women and men are complementary.<br>
<font color="red">Like ʿAlī was there outside working everything out, while Fāṭimah Bi in the house, home, who never went out, but He knew His source of energy: from where it was coming.</font><br>
......<br>
I mean, you can think of your mothers, how much they loved you -- all the men have a mother. Why? Why do you think of your mother so much? Because she sacrificed everything, but without showing that she was sacrificing. She did so much for you, so you could be a woman.<br>
Woman's potential to love is tremendous! Tremendous!<br>
<font color="red">And this is what we have to learn from Fāṭimah. She gave Her two children to be killed! She knew, because She was, after all, Viṣhṇumāyā. She was the Incarnation of Viṣhṇumāyā. She knew Her children will be killed! But still She sent Her children. "All right. Doesn't matter. Even if I know that They are going to die, it's all right."<br>
Such bravery, such courage, such understanding of the duty of Her children.</font><br>
Today we remember Them as Hasan and Husayn. <font color="red">Supposing She had said, 'No-no-no-no, don't go for the war. Stay at home.' And if She had forced Them not to go, then They would not have gone!</font> We would not have talked about Them today, isn't it? In any case They would have been dead sometime, but the death of a hero They got because of Their mother. <font color="red">Of course They were also a kind of Incarnations, but the way She gave Them absolutely complete encouragement, "Go and fight for the right thing," because these fundamentalists were trying to bring their fanaticism.</font><br>
So, today is a day I have to tell men also that you must learn to respect a woman who is chaste. 
......<br>
<font color="red">And this special Pūjā for Fāṭimah Bi is Pūjā to Viṣhṇumāyā.</font><br>
Also the guilt that works on the left Viśhuddhi can be cured if you develop your chastity. You'll never feel guilty! Because that's such a virtue you have. In that virtue, you will never, never feel guilty. And you can stand up to any nonsense because, 'We are standing on the Truth of Chastity.'<br>
<font color="red">Today is special day, I would say, when we are worshiping this great ideal of chastity, that is Fāṭimah Bi.</font><br> 
......<br>
[During the offering of gifts:] <font color="red">...... stone phīrozā comes from Iran, and Fāṭimah used ... used to wear phīrozā beam.</font> So I, this for a turquoise. Is called as phīrozā.

<b>Version 1:</b><br>
"Today women have gone weaker so the men have also become weak and powerless. Till the purity and loving mother like qualities develop in a woman the Gṛuhalakṣhmī Śhakti does not get awakened in her.<br>
But she should be wise. Gṛuhalakṣhmī has to be wise and intelligent.<br>
So we can say that when this Mahākālī Śhakti gets cool and peaceful it becomes Gṛuhalakṣhmī.<br>
<font color="red">We believe in the Power of Fāṭimah as perfect Gṛuhalakṣhmī and she should sit on the Throne of Gṛuhalakṣhmī.</font><br>
By this Power of Mahākālī a woman can correct her children. She keeps her character pure and we are witness that the pativrata, women's devotion towards her husband, cannot be destroyed by any thing because it is her śhakti. People and negativities are afraid of pativratā women.<br>
Also the husbands should understand that the power within them is from the śhakti, their wife."<br>
<br>
<b>Version 2:</b><br>
"This śhakti comes from the women's śhālīnatā. And as long as this śhālīnatā of the woman is not active, the Gṛuhalakṣhmī's Power does not manifest within her.<br>
But she has to be clever. Gṛuhalakṣhmī has to be clever. Secondly she has to be understanding.<br>
So we can say when this Mahākālī Śhakti becomes very calm, then she becomes gṛuhalakṣhmī.<br>
<font color="red">So we believe in Fāṭimah in that She decorates the throne of Gṛuhalakṣhmī.</font><br>
With this Power of Mahākālī, the woman keeps her children on the proper road. She keeps her character shining, and we are witnesses to the fact that the devotion and faithfulness of a devoted, faithful wife cannot be destroyed by anyone. She has her śhakti. This is Mahākālī's Śhakti: that people are afraid of a devoted wife.<br>
And husbands should also know that the active power inside them also conies from the woman."<br>

"The Primordial Master was also born as Macchindranāth, and again as Zoroaster who was worshiped by the ancient Persians, and still revered by Parsis. Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism. In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates. <font color="red">He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya).</font> Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā). Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918. Altogether there were ten major Avatāras of Dattātreya.<br>
<font color="red">Later They were born in Arabia as Hasan and Husayn, the two sons of Fāṭimah, daughter of Muhammad Sāhib.</font> They were murdered in a very violent war at Karbalāʾ. Their death signifies a great sacrifice in the name of religion. It is an indication how people who are extreme in nature take to fanaticism and, in their blindness, kill the very essence of religion that is born in flesh and blood as an Incarnation. This awakening gave a rude shock to the mass of religious human beings of the land, and there ensued a phenomenon of mass repentance. In this way people were made to realize that there can be no attachment to war for a realized Soul. Violence and nonviolence are attributes of mind but awareness is beyond these extremes. In defense of righteousness one has to go to war, but when one becomes the witness one only sees the play of war without taking any credit or discredit for it, or being disturbed by its aggression.<br>
<font color="red">After Fāṭimah, the Reincarnation of Sītā, died, sectarian war broke out among the Muslims. One side, the Shiya sect, was founded by Her; in Indian dialect Sītā is pronounced 'Shiya'.</font> They are known today as Shiites. Shiya women are regarded as fair, innocent and beautiful because of their motherly expressions; in the same way the women of Janakapur, Sītā's birthplace in India, are similarly blessed by Mahālakṣhmī."<br>

"Brahmadeva represents that aspect of God Almighty which manifests as the Creator of both the subtle side (esthetics), and of the gross side of material creation. Brahmadeva looks like an ascetic, a saintly personality, with a beard and mustache. He has four heads and all the hair on His heads is tied up in a top-knot. His body is thin with His most prominent feature being bulging and very large eyes. <font color="red">Brahmadeva rarely incarnates but He has incarnated once as Hazarat ʿAlī, husband of Fāṭimah and son-in-law of Muhammad Sāhib.</font> Some ancient Sages tried to explain the meaning of His four heads as the expression of creation into four <i>Vedas</i>. The meaning of His heads is much wider and deeper, though. Brahmadeva is the symbol of the Creative Power of the Supreme, the Īśhwara, Brahma, God. This creative power is expressed through the plane of matter in this universe. All material things have three dimensions but there is a fourth dimension which only human beings can see and feel. This fourth dimension is the esthetic dimension created by balanced harmonies and the integration of different textures, forms and lines. Animals have no sense of beauty; only human beings can feel the esthetics of a composition of different colors, or the movement of lines and the melting of forms. The feelings of joy acquired through this esthetic sense create a <i>Rasa</i> (a secretion of the essence or juice of a feeling). This Rasa gives one a stimulative feeling that sets in motion waves of esthetic joy within the Inner Self. These joys are of different frequencies and vibrations. One does not need to dissect them but as I look at the different petals of this chakra, I shall try to explain the kinds of joys present in the realm of creativity expressed through divine enlightenment."<br>
