Some of these are Vāsiṣhṭha Yoga, Ṛigveda, Puruṣha Sūkta, Upaniṣhads of Atharvaveda, Yogopanishad, Yogaśhikhā Upaniṣhad, Kaṭhopaniṣhad and Yoga Kuṇḍalinī Upaniṣhad. <font color="red">In the Purāṇas are Devī Bhāgavat[am] Purāṇa, Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa, Śhrī Bhāgavat[a] Purāṇa, etc.</font> In Sanhitas: Haṭh[a] Yoga Sanhita, Laya Yoga Sanhita, Rāj Yoga Sanhita, Śhiv Sanhita.

I am sometimes surprised, how far did humans have seen these things so minutely.<br>
......<br>
But have anyone heard Mārkaṇḍeya Swāmī's name? He, in Saptaśhatī, described Śhrī Durgā."</font><br>

"Those people who are very big paṇḍits, if they want they should read Kabīr Dās, Nāṇakjī and if possible also read Śhaṅkarāchārya, He is the best. If you read Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya then you can understand what is this Chaitanya Laharī [Wave of Vibrations], I am talking about.<br>
I have not yet met anyone who has systematically said or explained about Kuṇḍalinī.<br>

"But you have to be very careful with those horrible destructive forces that have come in so many ways. I can tell you that there are sixteen rākṣhasas whom I know have been taken birth. Mahiṣhāsur is there, Narakāsur is there, Vṛutrāsur is there. There there are six rākṣhasinis who have taken birth. And you have no idea to what they are doing. They'll do all kinds of tricks to convince you that they are godly people.<br>
<font color="red">But you must only ask for the Supreme, for the Last, which is being described by so many Sages like Mārkaṇḍeya, like Śhaṅkarāchārya.<br>
We are so lucky that we have had such great people, who have elaborately said, who have clearly said, that, "This is what is the supreme, ask for the reality. And do not ask for something cheapish.</font>"<br>
You cannot cheapen God. You do not try to mold Him [laughing:] in your own small cups.<br>

He was such a big devotee of Mother that He won't do anything other than offering prayers to Mother. All the time He kept praying to Mother Bhagavatī and He knew nothing else. He would suggest only to pray to the Mother and anything shall be done. And this is absolutely correct. He said, "Whatever Yoga, etc. you do, will not help you find Divine.

"Kuṇḍalinī knowledge is very much known to us.<br>
Actually we are so much anglicized, thanks to Lord [Thomas Babington] Macaulay, that a very few people who even know the word Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
If you read Kabīr, the whole thing, Kabīr is nothing but Sahaja Yoga.<br>
How many of you read Kabīr? For fashion sake even if they read they don't know what He is talking about.<br>
Nāṇak has talked about it, Gyāneśhwara has talked about it.<br>
Christ has talked about it that, "I will appear before you like tongues of flames." What is the meaning? Christians do not know about it.<br>
So it is being promised.<br>
Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, of course, the greatest son of our country has described it so elaborately, but those who call themselves also Hindus, do they know the word Kuṇḍalinī? <font color="red">While throughout in the Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇ, such a Great Sage, the one who has not read the Mārkaṇḍeya, I would not call him an Indian at all.<br>
One of the greatest Sages of this country is Mārkaṇḍeya who has written a complete knowledge about the Devī to such a little extent, to such a small detail that you will be so surprised, 'How He could see all these things? Did He enter into the body of Devī to find out these small small minute things?'</font><br>

"Take the case of our Buddha. Now, Buddha was the ... one of the very Great Incarnations in the sense that He was the son, one of the sons of Rāma, who incarnated on this Earth, Buddha, to occupy the highest life on this Earth. So He had to take saṃnyāsa. Because without that He could not show that.<br>
But there was no need for anybody else to take saṃnyāsa.<br>
But in His case mistakes, uh-uh-uh I mean why there were some mistakes about things were, because when He tried all these tricks of saṃnyāsa, going here and there, He never realized that this is all not needed.<br>
He was so tired and fagged out, that suddenly, spontaneous, the Primordial Mother Herself gave Him the Realization. Because He was so tired.<br>
Now, supposing this is Caxton Hall. To come here, you go to, say, uh-uh-uh-uh Reading, then you go to-oo, in the north, to Leeds, then you go this side and uh-uh-uh then you go to Brighton and come back here. And you tell everybody, "If you have to go to Caxton Hall, you better do all that." It is just like that! It is just like that, very misleading!<br>
Because when He found it out, as you have found out too, you do not realize how you have found it. You do not know how you have done it. If I do not tell you that it is God who has done it, how are you going to believe it? You'll think, 'I have done Self-realization, all right, I am a self-realized person.'<br>
Self is most important.<br>
That's why He believed this a ... anīśhwaratv, means atheism. He said, "There's no God. Only thing, the Self is to be achieved."<br>
Naturally. Because there was nobody to tell Him that, 'You have achieved through the Grace of the Primordial Mother.'<br>
So He was to be born again as one of the sons of Fāṭimah Bi, who was the daughter of Muhammad Sāhab. <font color="red">Then again He was to be born as Mārkaṇḍeya, and again as Śhaṅkarāchārya: just to neutralize what He has been preaching.</font><br>
So you will see that in the sixth century Śhaṅkarāchārya is the one who put end to Buddhism, the nonsense of Buddhism in India. Because, apart from what Buddha's understanding of the whole thing is, the His disciples made it so perverse, that somebody had to come down to tell: that, 'The marriage system has to be re-established.'<br>
And this is how this right side was controlled through various Incarnations coming down."<br>

<font color="red">Do read Devī Māhātmyam or Devī Bhāgavat[am]. Go through the description of Śhrī Mahāviṣhṇu in it. It is described that Śhrī Rādhājī prepared Her son similarly as Śhrī Pārvatī did it but the main principle in this is Śhrī Gaṇeśha Principle and the son prepared as Śhrī Gaṇeśha came in the world as Jesus Christ."</font><br>
[<b> Version 2:</b>]<br>
This Gaṇeśh Tattwa, when It comes on the Āgñyā chakra, It took the form of Christ when It came in this world.<br>

You could say Mārkaṇḍeya is My most beloved son.<br> 
Nowadays nobody reads Mārkaṇḍeya, but if you can get it, read the description of Śhrī Mahāviṣhṇu. He has mentioned that Rādhā had created Her own Son by Herself. Means just as Pārvatī created Her Son, She too had created [Hers].</font>"<br>

"Two Great Powers are combined in Jesus Christ. The first Power is that of Śhrī Gaṇeśha, who is recognized as His Original Power, and the other is that of Śhrī Kārttikeya.<br>
Because of this, the Incarnation of Jesus Christ is of complete Brahman Tattwa or Oṃkār.<br>
Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, He being the Father of Jesus Christ, bestowed a number of boons on Jesus Christ prior to His birth.<br>
<font color="red">One of these boons was that, "You would dwell on a plane higher than that of mine."</font><br>
This could be explained to mean, that while the plane of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa is the Viśhuddhi chakra, located at the base of our neck, the plane of Jesus is Āgñyā chakra, which is located at the junction of the optic thalamus.<br>
<font color="red">The second boon granted by Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was that, "You would be the support of the whole universe."<br>
The third boon was, that, "You would be the first to receive one-sixteenth part of all the offerings made to Me in Pūjā."<br>
In this way, after bestowing a number of boons, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa permitted Śhrī Jesus Christ to incarnate on the Earth.<br>
You would understand these things better, if you read Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa. Śhrī Mārkaṇḍeya, the author of the Purāṇa has beautifully explained a number of such subtler points.<br>
In the same Purāṇa, there is a graphic description of Śhrī Mahāviṣhṇu. If you would listen to this description while in meditation, you would notice that the description is of Jesus Christ only.</font>"<br>

"So all these experimentations are of no use.<br>
As a Mother I'm telling you, 'Please stop it.' Awaken your Lord Gaṇeśha within you, by respecting your chastity!<br>
Our Indian men think that, 'Chastity has no nuh-neah ... no meaning for them. Only the women have to be chaste, and men are not supposed to be chaste at all'! Is more surprising.<br>
Chastity is the most important thing for human beings, to be in the center, because it is Śhrī Gaṇeśha's blessings one gets, then only the Kuṇḍalinī is going to rise.<br>
Now, Śhrī Gaṇeśha has incarnated in this Earth ... on this Earth Himself as Lord Jesus Christ. He came on this Earth as Lord Jesus Christ on this center, what you call the Āgñyā chakra, where I am putting this red thing.<br>
But He has evolved a lot. There are Eleven Rudras, as we call them Ekādeśha [Ekādaśha] Rudras, which are His Powers.<br>
<font color="red">All this is described in the Devī Māhātmyam, Devī Bhāgavat[am]. His name is Mahāviṣhṇu. He is called as the Support of the Universe.<br>

He never preached any Hinduism, it's a wrong idea! He said, "Na Yogen na Sāṅkhyen" [part of line 1 of Vivekachūḍāmaṇi 56]. He said, "Not by these philosophies you are gore ... you are going to gain [get] to God. But through Mother's Grace only you will gain that position."<br>

In Hindi to support, the ādhār, is to hold Him. Because He is from the very beginning. As Gaṇeśha is Ādhā-rā and as Christ also is Ādhār.<br>
But what you have done of Him, His spirit, His intellect. So give anything to human beings, and they'll make up with a laugh of it. Just think: the brain is like that. I don't know how you can do that to Him. It's another crucifixion, every moment I feel, the way people have done it."<br>

One has to accept it. It is so. Any one of them, whosoever has written any books, even, I would say, Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, He could not explain so many things which you know.<br>
<font color="red">But the quality of Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya is very great, or people of His type, Mārkaṇḍeya or Buddha, the quality is very high, because They are extremely pure people -- purity. They have achieved individual salvation of a very high degree while you have achieved your collective salvation better. But individually, they are of a very-very high quality. I mean, They had no doubts about Divine Power, They had no doubts about God. They never had any doubts. And They were very dignified. And They never bothered as to Their petty problems of life. For Them, this was too petty to think about.

<font color="red"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> I have so far told you how the evolution was led by Viṣhṇu and His Incarnations on the Earth.<br>

These Masters evolved new personalities endowed with the Principles of Disciples or Śhiṣhya Tattwa, who manifested as Great Disciples of this Ādi Guru.

"It's very interesting to see: how ah the spirituality spread into these countries, and he ... then how it died out.<br>
All these things happened, but then They were born again and again. They were born as Mahāvīra and Buddha. They are the same. They are born as Mārkaṇḍeya. They are born as Kabīra, as Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya.<br>
It was Buddha who was born as Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, just to correct Himself. Buddha was shocked the way people were going towards Nirākāra, that He had to be born as Śhaṅkarāchārya to tell people, "Oh God! What are you doing?" It was only Buddha who came to correct Himself as Śhaṅkarāchārya.<br>
It is so [laughing:] surprising, that people are fighting, Buddhist and Hindus are great uh enemies of each other. But they do not know that the person who really re-established Hinduism was the same who established Buddhism.<br>
So, imagine the same personality coming in and agai... coming, coming again and again on this Earth, tries to correct uh-uh-uh His disciples, again finds that there are two groups He has created: it's a big problem.<br>
<font color="red">Now, Mahāvīra also was one of Them, who ... who was born again and again, and He was Mārkaṇḍeya, and He was Kabīra.</font><br>
The way Kabīra lashes people, you can see that He is tremendous! He is like Bhairava.<br>
And the Power of Bhairava, Kabīra has used in His language, but for Hindi poets it is Sadhukaddi [vernacular dialect of Hindi+Punjabi+Māravāṛī in medieval North India] and they have made fun of it.<br>
The best thing of a person who doesn't want to face reality, is to make fun of everyone. That is the best way.<br>
They said, "What is this talk, 'Iḍā, Piṅgalā, Suṣhumṇā'? Who is He? What does He think of Himself?" But He was appreciated, very much, by the Saints and specially by Guru Nāṇaka, who included all His poetry in His Grantha Sāhab.<br>
He's included so many of these poetry from all the realized Souls from Ma... Maharashtra, also."<br>

"Now the trouble is: this knowledge was a very secret knowledge, thousands of years back. And it started descending, this knowledge, to people very slowly.<br>
Like on a tree there's only one flower or two flowers in the beginning.<br>
Now, in the sixth century -- actually Christ talked about it quite a lot. And the other people, like Moses, and all these people have talked about it. But the ones who wrote, never got anything there perhaps, so they wrote it in a very mystical way like, "I'll appear before you like tongues of flames," or, "The Fir... uh the Tree of Fire" and all that, indicative of all that.<br>
But ah it so happened that in the sixth century, somebody in India, called as Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, He was actually Buddha reborn, He started talking about it. Self-realization, of course Buddha talked about it. Then He started telling about these, all these nāḍīs and everything He described.<br>
<font color="red">But there is a poet, in India, whose name is Mārkaṇḍeya, who has written about this. They say He was living in India about, say, ten thousand years back, this poet, about that time.</font><br>
So this knowledge was known to people but was not put down on the paper, was not circulated, was not for en masse."<br>

"<font color="red">But in the Purāṇas it is described that Kṛiṣhṇa said, "You are higher than Me. I placed You higher than Me." He placed Him, you can imagine, that Christ is at this point, and Kṛiṣhṇa is at this point. He placed higher Him than Him. And He said: "In anywhere people worship Me" -- Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa said -- "automatically You are worshiped. You will be the Support," Ādhāra, "of the whole world."<br>
Is wonderful to say that, about, I think, fourteen thousand years or twelve thousand years back, Mārkaṇḍeya, such a great Saint was born in India. And He has written the complete Gaṇeśha Stotram. Means the complete praise of the Gaṇeśha. You can see the translation is so beautiful. And that he said: "You will be so humble."</font><br>
<font color="red">He is the One who is the ninth Incarnation, called as Bauddha, among the Ten Incarnations.<br>
That, 'He will be so humble that He will wash the feet of His disciples.'<br>
All the miracles of Christ are described in these books. But these books are not translated.<br>
And that, 'He will be the One, when enlightened within you with the Kuṇḍalinī, He will take away all your karmas, and all your conditionings. Because He will die for your sins, for your karmas. The world will not have to suffer anymore, if He is awaken within you.'</font><br>
These are all the things already written, thousands of years back, can you imagine?<br>
I wish the Christians who went from here [laughing:] to take, explain Christianity to Indians, told them that, 'Mahāviṣhṇu is already born! And we are preaching about Him! The One who is going to suck your conditioning, the One who is going to suck all your problems of karmas.' They never told them.<br>
On the contrary, they were so stupid, I must tell you, that they would put a loaf in a ... in a well, and say: that, "You all have become Christians because we have put the meat of the beef ... uh uh the beef inside the well." In ... Indians don't eat beef, you see. "So you all have become Christians." Villages after villages they converted into Christianity. They started branding them as Christians.<br>

"I told you yesterday how, in the ancient times, also this knowledge of Kuṇḍalinī was known to us. This knowledge was known to us that India ... because India is the country where we are supposed to look after the roots of the Creation. We have to look after the roots.<br>
While others have the tree, the flowers, and the fruits, in India the roots grew up unknown to common masses. These roots reached that stage where Kuṇḍalinī became a knowledge of very, very few people, actually extremely few I should say.<br>
And this knowledge was not revealed for many days till, I would say, Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya Himself started talking about it. <font color="red">Though Mārkaṇḍeya has described Kuṇḍalinī, the different powers of the Mother, but it was Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya who came to this Earth and He is the one who talked of Kuṇḍalinī openly.</font><br>
The reason was: before this, it was kept secret, and part of it was revealed and people used to doubt. Or if it was to be revealed, whom to reveal it? Because there were very peop... few people who were incapable [capable] of knowing about it."<br>

"Now when I'm talking to you about the mechanism that is built within us for our last breakthrough, you need not believe Me. <br>
In our country also, this knowledge was kept a secret for thousands of years. <font color="red">Though we can say people like Mārkaṇḍeya, whose dates could be fourteen thousand [years ago], or later on, up to Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, people did write about the Kuṇḍalinī.</font><br>
And at the time of Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, He very clearly talked about it. That was the tradition of evolution described in all these great Scriptures.<br>
Even in the Bible, you find the Tree of Fire. It says: "I will appear before you as tongues of flames." <br>
Even Muhammad Sāhab, who came much later, very clearly, very, very clearly, and elaborately, at length, talked about the Resurrection Day. He said: "At the Time of Resurrection, your hands will speak."<br>
But everybody missed the point.<br>
Zoroaster talked about it thousands of years back. Confucius, Lao Tze, everyone talked about it: that, 'We have to be the Spirit.'<br>
Christ clearly said: "You are to be born-again!" Then Nicodemus asked Him: "Do you mean to say, I should enter into the womb of my mother?" "No," He said, "whatever is born of the flesh is the flesh. You are to be born of the Holy Ghost." "<br>

The first book he wrote was Vivekachūḍāmaṇi, in which he describes this fourth dimension and explains why we should try to attain this fourth dimension. An intellectual, one Mister Sharma, challenged him and told him that he could not do anything as an ascetic and win over my intellect. Thus he felt that for the common people all this discussion might just seem to be mental acrobatics. So he decided to write books just praising the Primordial Mother, especially in Saundaryalaharī, where he described all the Divine Vibrations as the vibrations of the loving beauty of the Primordial Mother. At that time all this was written in the Sanskrit language but the common people did not understand this language, except for a very few learned people, who also did not want to go into the details of this exposition."<br>
