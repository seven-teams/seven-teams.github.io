"References to Kuṇḍalinī awakening abound in many of the Indian Scriptures. Some of these are Vāsiṣhṭha Yoga, Ṛigveda, Puruṣha Sūkta, Upaniṣhads of Atharvaveda, Yogopanishad, Yogaśhikhā Upaniṣhad, Kaṭhopaniṣhad and Yoga Kuṇḍalinī Upaniṣhad. <font color="DarkRed">In the Purāṇas are Devī Bhāgavat[am] Purāṇa, Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa, Śhrī Bhāgavat[a] Purāṇa, etc.</font> In Sanhitas: Haṭh[a] Yoga Sanhita, Laya Yoga Sanhita, Rāj Yoga Sanhita, Śhiv Sanhita. In the Yoga tests: Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā, Saundaryalaharī, Śhubhodayam, Lalitā Sahasrānam, and by Saints such as Bhakt Kabīr, Nāṇak, Gyāneśhwar, etc."<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"You have read Devī Māhātmyam. Not one word is wrong in it. Mārkaṇḍeya Swāmī was a great Seer. Not a word by Him is untrue. Not a word is distorted.<br>
I am sometimes surprised, how far did humans have seen these things so minutely.<br>
......<br>
But have anyone heard Mārkaṇḍeya Swāmī's name? He, in Saptaśhatī, described Śhrī Durgā."</font><br>

"Those people who are very big paṇḍits, if they want they should read Kabīr Dās, Nāṇakjī and if possible also read Śhaṅkarāchārya, He is the best. If you read Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya then you can understand what is this Chaitanya Laharī [Wave of Vibrations], I am talking about.<br>
I have not yet met anyone who has systematically said or explained about Kuṇḍalinī.<br> 
You know that little knowledge is a dangerous thing. The same can be said about Kuṇḍalinī, otherwise how they could have written this kind of strange things, I do not know on what basis.<br>
<font color="DarkRed">But still the Witness State of human being is so high, so high that if you read Devī Bhāgavat[am], Saptaśhatī of Mārkaṇḍeya Swāmī, then you will be surprised how deeply, in small detail,They have understood this thing."</font><br>

"But you have to be very careful with those horrible destructive forces that have come in so many ways. I can tell you that there are sixteen rākṣhasas whom I know have been taken birth. Mahiṣhāsur is there, Narakāsur is there, Vṛutrāsur is there. There there are six rākṣhasinis who have taken birth. And you have no idea to what they are doing. They'll do all kinds of tricks to convince you that they are godly people.<br>
<font color="DarkRed">But you must only ask for the Supreme, for the Last, which is being described by so many Sages like Mārkaṇḍeya, like Śhaṅkarāchārya.<br>
We are so lucky that we have had such great people, who have elaborately said, who have clearly said, that, "This is what is the supreme, ask for the reality. And do not ask for something cheapish.</font>"<br>
You cannot cheapen God. You do not try to mold Him [laughing:] in your own small cups.<br>
......<br>
Above this chakra is the Āgñyā chakra, which is a very, very important chakra, which is the Door, which is the Door of the Sahasrāra. At the Āgñyā chakra resides Mahāviṣhṇu.<br>

He was nobody else but Jesus Christ."<br>

"You can have free cabaret, and you can have free discourses on all the nonsensical things debasing God Himself! All these things are so interesting to human being! Are they really seeking the Truth? Are they really asking the reality?<br>
They will never read Śhaṅkarāchārya!

He was such a big devotee of Mother that He won't do anything other than offering prayers to Mother. All the time He kept praying to Mother Bhagavatī and He knew nothing else. He would suggest only to pray to the Mother and anything shall be done. And this is absolutely correct. He said, "Whatever Yoga, etc. you do, will not help you find Divine. You can find [the Divine] only when Mother endows Her blessings, otherwise you just can't find Him. He mentioned this very clearly."<br>

Now this Kuṇḍalinī, Dñyāneśhwar has also talked a lot about It. <font color="DarkRed">Mārkaṇḍeya has done the most amount of work on it, so has Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya. They have described and explained it so beautifully.</font><br>
But I am surprised that no one reads the work of Śhaṅkarāchārya. He was a resident of Kerala and He had spent His entire lifetime over there. So it was even more surprising when I came to know that the people from His place didn't even know who He was.<br>
So much ignorance has come into people over there. They think, just because they have been educated in English they are someone special."<br>

Now this Kuṇḍalinī is right here, Dñyāneśhwara has also talked a lot about It. <font color="DarkRed">Similarly, Mārkaṇḍeya Swāmī and Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya have done the maximum amount of work on It. They have made It lucid and explained It all so beautifully.</font><br>
But I am surprised that no one reads the work of Śhaṅkarāchārya. Not only this but I had been to Kovalam and He belongs to Kerala, He spent his life in Kālaṭi village there, and I was surprised when people over there told Me, "We do not know who this Śhaṅkarāchārya, Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya was, whom are you speaking about."<br>
So much ignorance has come into people due to English education.<br>

"Kuṇḍalinī knowledge is very much known to us.<br>
Actually we are so much anglicized, thanks to Lord [Thomas Babington] Macaulay, that a very few people who even know the word Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
If you read Kabīr, the whole thing, Kabīr is nothing but Sahaja Yoga.<br>
How many of you read Kabīr? For fashion sake even if they read they don't know what He is talking about.<br>
Nāṇak has talked about it, Gyāneśhwara has talked about it.<br>
Christ has talked about it that, "I will appear before you like tongues of flames." What is the meaning? Christians do not know about it.<br>
So it is being promised.<br>
Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, of course, the greatest son of our country has described it so elaborately, but those who call themselves also Hindus, do they know the word Kuṇḍalinī? <font color="DarkRed">While throughout in the Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇ, such a Great Sage, the one who has not read the Mārkaṇḍeya, I would not call him an Indian at all.<br>
One of the greatest Sages of this country is Mārkaṇḍeya who has written a complete knowledge about the Devī to such a little extent, to such a small detail that you will be so surprised, 'How He could see all these things? Did He enter into the body of Devī to find out these small small minute things?'</font><br>
But all this we have done in this country much more than any other country."<br>

"Take the case of our Buddha. Now, Buddha was the ... one of the very Great Incarnations in the sense that He was the son, one of the sons of Rāma, who incarnated on this Earth, Buddha, to occupy the highest life on this Earth. So He had to take saṃnyāsa. Because without that He could not show that.<br>
But there was no need for anybody else to take saṃnyāsa.<br>
But in His case mistakes, uh-uh-uh I mean why there were some mistakes about things were, because when He tried all these tricks of saṃnyāsa, going here and there, He never realized that this is all not needed.<br>
He was so tired and fagged out, that suddenly, spontaneous, the Primordial Mother Herself gave Him the Realization. Because He was so tired.<br>
Now, supposing this is Caxton Hall. To come here, you go to, say, uh-uh-uh-uh Reading, then you go to-oo, in the north, to Leeds, then you go this side and uh-uh-uh then you go to Brighton and come back here. And you tell everybody, "If you have to go to Caxton Hall, you better do all that." It is just like that! It is just like that, very misleading!<br>
Because when He found it out, as you have found out too, you do not realize how you have found it. You do not know how you have done it. If I do not tell you that it is God who has done it, how are you going to believe it? You'll think, 'I have done Self-realization, all right, I am a self-realized person.'<br>
Self is most important.<br>
That's why He believed this a ... anīśhwaratv, means atheism. He said, "There's no God. Only thing, the Self is to be achieved."<br>
Naturally. Because there was nobody to tell Him that, 'You have achieved through the Grace of the Primordial Mother.'<br>
So He was to be born again as one of the sons of Fāṭimah Bi, who was the daughter of Muhammad Sāhab. <font color="DarkRed">Then again He was to be born as Mārkaṇḍeya, and again as Śhaṅkarāchārya: just to neutralize what He has been preaching.</font><br>
So you will see that in the sixth century Śhaṅkarāchārya is the one who put end to Buddhism, the nonsense of Buddhism in India. Because, apart from what Buddha's understanding of the whole thing is, the His disciples made it so perverse, that somebody had to come down to tell: that, 'The marriage system has to be re-established.'<br>
And this is how this right side was controlled through various Incarnations coming down."<br>

"Is a technique which is written in all the Scriptures. Kabīra has described it. If Nāṇaka has described it. All the other Scriptures of Śhaṅkarāchārya has described it. <font color="DarkRed">If you read Mārkaṇḍeya, He has described it.</font> Nothing new about it.<br>

"Now, this Gaṇeśha Principle becomes Jesus Christ when He arrived in this world at Āgñyā chakra.<br> 
<font color="DarkRed">Do read Devī Māhātmyam or Devī Bhāgavat[am]. Go through the description of Śhrī Mahāviṣhṇu in it. It is described that Śhrī Rādhājī prepared Her son similarly as Śhrī Pārvatī did it but the main principle in this is Śhrī Gaṇeśha Principle and the son prepared as Śhrī Gaṇeśha came in the world as Jesus Christ."</font><br>
[<b> Version 2:</b>]<br>
This Gaṇeśh Tattwa, when It comes on the Āgñyā chakra, It took the form of Christ when It came in this world.<br>
<font color="DarkRed">You would have read in Devī Māhātmya[m], the [Devī] Bhāgavat[am] written by Śhrī Mārkaṇḍeya.<br>
You could say Mārkaṇḍeya is My most beloved son.<br> 
Nowadays nobody reads Mārkaṇḍeya, but if you can get it, read the description of Śhrī Mahāviṣhṇu. He has mentioned that Rādhā had created Her own Son by Herself. Means just as Pārvatī created Her Son, She too had created [Hers].</font>"<br>

"Two Great Powers are combined in Jesus Christ. The first Power is that of Śhrī Gaṇeśha, who is recognized as His Original Power, and the other is that of Śhrī Kārttikeya.<br>
Because of this, the Incarnation of Jesus Christ is of complete Brahman Tattwa or Oṃkār.<br>
Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, He being the Father of Jesus Christ, bestowed a number of boons on Jesus Christ prior to His birth.<br>
<font color="DarkRed">One of these boons was that, "You would dwell on a plane higher than that of mine."</font><br>
This could be explained to mean, that while the plane of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa is the Viśhuddhi chakra, located at the base of our neck, the plane of Jesus is Āgñyā chakra, which is located at the junction of the optic thalamus.<br>
<font color="DarkRed">The second boon granted by Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was that, "You would be the support of the whole universe."<br>
The third boon was, that, "You would be the first to receive one-sixteenth part of all the offerings made to Me in Pūjā."<br>
In this way, after bestowing a number of boons, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa permitted Śhrī Jesus Christ to incarnate on the Earth.<br>
You would understand these things better, if you read Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa. Śhrī Mārkaṇḍeya, the author of the Purāṇa has beautifully explained a number of such subtler points.<br>
In the same Purāṇa, there is a graphic description of Śhrī Mahāviṣhṇu. If you would listen to this description while in meditation, you would notice that the description is of Jesus Christ only.</font>"<br>

"So all these experimentations are of no use.<br>
As a Mother I'm telling you, 'Please stop it.' Awaken your Lord Gaṇeśha within you, by respecting your chastity!<br>
Our Indian men think that, 'Chastity has no nuh-neah ... no meaning for them. Only the women have to be chaste, and men are not supposed to be chaste at all'! Is more surprising.<br>
Chastity is the most important thing for human beings, to be in the center, because it is Śhrī Gaṇeśha's blessings one gets, then only the Kuṇḍalinī is going to rise.<br>
Now, Śhrī Gaṇeśha has incarnated in this Earth ... on this Earth Himself as Lord Jesus Christ. He came on this Earth as Lord Jesus Christ on this center, what you call the Āgñyā chakra, where I am putting this red thing.<br>
But He has evolved a lot. There are Eleven Rudras, as we call them Ekādeśha [Ekādaśha] Rudras, which are His Powers.<br>
<font color="DarkRed">All this is described in the Devī Māhātmyam, Devī Bhāgavat[am]. His name is Mahāviṣhṇu. He is called as the Support of the Universe.<br>
But who reads Devī Bhāgavat[am]? Or who reads Mārkaṇḍeya's books or Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya's books?<br>
They will uh say that, 'We are great Hindus,' and they have not even heard the name of Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya!</font><br>
I went to Kerala and these newspaper people told Me that, "We have never read Him."<br>
In Kerala, such a great man was born, Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, I mean they have not read about Him!<br>
He never preached any Hinduism, it's a wrong idea! He said, "Na Yogen na Sāṅkhyen" [part of line 1 of Vivekachūḍāmaṇi 56]. He said, "Not by these philosophies you are gore ... you are going to gain [get] to God. But through Mother's Grace only you will gain that position."<br>
He's clearly said it. He never believed in any such secular uh-uh-uh sort of ideas or any such ideas which meant that, 'This religion is different.' "<br>
