<font color="red">"The Raja Yoga is a derivation of Hathayoga. In this style the of practices the Gurus led a life like kings. They wore clothes like royal personalities and ruled the people. Raja Janaka an incarnation of Primordial Guru was the father of Seeta. In their inner life they were yogis but they led royal life without any attachment. They did not practice Asanas or Pranayamas but they worshiped God by different styles of bowing."</font><br>

<font color="red">"For example, if Rāvaṇa was to be born in this country, he can very well settle down here. And [he] call him... himself a God and preach such horrible things to destroy all the Sītās of this country.<br>
Is quite possible in the jet age: everybody has freedom to do whatever he likes.<br>
......<br>
The fear about Kuṇḍalinī must be given up. It's like fearing your own mother. If you know what is a Mother, and the purity of Hers. And if you remember how Sītā, the Mother, Her purity could not be spoiled by Rāvaṇa.<br>
......<br>
Rāvaṇa was a very powerful preacher and had a very big library of his own. And with his speech he used to mesmerize the people such a lot that they used to go into horrible states. He had that power within.<br>
And when Sītā would not allow him to come close to Her, he could not because of Her holiness and chastity, and Her Divine Powers. He used to threaten Her that, "In my next life I will come and destroy the chastity of every woman of Your country." "</font><br>

<font color="red">"Śhrī Dattātreya's Incarnations are numerous. Firstly He came as King Janaka. Śhrī Sītājī was His daughter, who was the embodiment of Śhakti Herself. Then He came as Macchindranāth, Zoroaster, and Muhammad Sāhab, who were a completely different type of human being.<br>
......<br>
Muhammad Sāhab was the same, Dattātreya's Incarnation, and the same Incarnation was King Janaka. The same Incarnation was Nāṇaka, whose sister Nāṇakī, was the same Ādi Śhakti. She was Sītājī.<br>
......<br>
Sītājī was Śhrī Rāma's wife. Was married. The injustice that was done to Her by the society, made Her leave the house, by accusing Her falsely, disgraced Her. Why back then these great people had a blindfold on? Why didn't they said, that, 'She is our Mother? You are asking Her to leave the house?' She already had passed the test, bypassing the fire, why were they dumbfounded then? What happened to their vigor [light] back then? All were so-called very great then.

If Sītā was caught in the guile of Rāvaṇa, it was a display of Her innocence. He had no stature to hold Her hand or misbehave with Her. Where is the glory of innocence and where is the cunningness of Rāvaṇa? No one can aggress an ordinary woman.<br>
But till such time he carried Sītā on his head, he remembered his own mother. All his greatness was reduced to the size of a small child."</font><br>

<font color="red">"Now, what will be your condition when you go to Hell? I am discussing all this, on this day of Diwālī because Diwālī was celebrated on the occasion of Sītājī's reunion with Rāma. We can no more be slaves once we embrace chastity. We are our own slaves and not the slaves of others. We shall not lie for any reason whatsoever. I have lived in Delhi for a long time and am quite surprised at how much they lie. They are not afraid of lying at all. By telling lies openly they might benefit here, they might earn more money, but it is not known that they will not go to Heaven. I want the Sahaja Yogis to promise that neither will they lie nor will they support the people who lie.<br>......<br>
Today is an auspicious day, because many things took place on this day. Sītājī returned during the period of Rām[a]chandrajī, whatever great deeds were done during the period of 'Kṛiṣhṇajī' were done by people who were realized Souls. So the first thing that you decide for sure is that we won't do any dishonest deed at the same time if any one else does then we will get him exposed. But I am seeing in this country that the Whites are fighting the Blacks, someone is fighting with someone else. They want the country of India to be separated which is not going to be beneficial at all. How can it be beneficial when you are honest and when you have a good character!"</font><br>

<font color="red">"During the Tretā Yuga, at the time of Śhrī Rāma, Ādi Śhakti incarnated in three separate human personalities, expressing Her three aspects:<br>
&emsp;1. Sītā [Jānakī] (Mahālakṣhmī) as the daughter of Rāja Janaka<br>
&emsp;&emsp;This was the first absolute human form (<i>Laukik</i>)"</font><br>
<font size="+0"><b>The Book of Ādi Śhakti, Chapter 1: Creation, the Eternal Play</b></font>

<div class="para-divider"></div>

<p>
<font color="red">"Maheśha (Śhiva), Viṣhṇu and Brahmadeva form the Trinity which incarnated as one teacher God, the Primordial Master, Dattātreya. He came onto this Earth to teach people the secrets of the Divine, to reveal God, and to help them cross the Ocean of Illusion themselves within their own identity. Evolution could not go further in the hands of human beings who were in the bondage of ignorance, so they were given guidance through this Incarnation of the Primordial Master (Ādi Guru) again and again in different lives. He was created as the three-headed child, Dattātreya, by Ādi Śhakti who appeared on Earth during the Tretā Yuga as Satī Anasūyā, wife of the Sage Atreya. He was born as Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara] who founded Jainism -- one of the oldest religions. Then he was born as Rāja Janaka, father of Jānakī also called Sītā, Rāma's wife. She was an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti.<br>
The Primordial Master was also born as Macchindranāth, and again as Zoroaster who was worshiped by the ancient Persians, and still revered by Parsis. Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism. In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates. He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā). Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918. Altogether there were ten major Avatāras of Dattātreya.<br>
It is very important to understand that until the animal stage there was no need for animals to solve the problem of life, as animals were under the complete command of God. At the human stage, however, as we learn from the history of Adam and Eve, they were given the choice and freedom to solve the problem of life. That was how evolution was to go a step further. Without such freedom human beings were not equipped to learn the secrets of Divine Power.<br>
Ādi Viṣhṇu Himself took His seventh Incarnation during the Tretā Yuga as Lord Rāma, a human being who crossed the Ocean of Illusion and touched a new dimension of awareness. As Śhrī Rāma, Ādi Viṣhṇu came to enlighten human social and political consciousness as the true model of what Plato, thousand of years later, would call 'the philosopher king'. He settled for human beings the rules of socio-political correct action (<i>samāj tatha rājkaraṇ dharma</i>). He also expressed God's aspect of majesty and order within kingship and institutions, and led a life of an ideal human being (<i>Maryādā Puruṣhottama</i>). This was witnessed by multitudes, resulting in a mass awareness for the first time among human beings. Śhrī Rāma was the ideal King for all kings, and <i>Rām Rājya</i>, His kingdom, was the ideal kingdom.<br>
He reached a point in the Primordial Heart Chakra (Ādi Anāhata Chakra) crossing the Void along the central path (Ādi Suṣhumṇā Nāḍī). His wife Sītā was an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. The <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i>, the epic about Lord Rāma's exploits written by Vālmīki, tells how Lord Rāma was made to forget that He was the Reincarnation of Ādi Viṣhṇu for some time, because it was desired that He should act absolutely like a human being, to make them feel absolutely free with him. He gave them a human leadership. Later on, when Sītā disappeared back into the Mother Earth, Lord Rāma remembered His divinity.<br>
At the time of Rāma's Incarnation Ādi Śhakti existed in three persons: Mahālakṣhmī, as Sītā, His wife; Mahāsaraswatī, as Satī Anasūyā who gave birth to Dattātreya, the Primordial Master; and Mahākālī as Mandodarī, the wife of the demon Rāvaṇa.<br>
......<br>
The Incarnations of Rādhā show how the ideas of human beings gradually changed. The life as Rādhā was definitely a peg above in social advancement in the dogmatic thinking of society, compared to the time of Sītā. She was not married to Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa in a formal human way (<i>laukika</i>). Their wedding was divine (<i>alaukika</i>), and was performed spiritually and socially in the presence of many people by Brahmadeva. Earlier, as Sītā, although formally married to Rāma in a wedding ceremony that was collectively sanctioned, She was still condemned by society. Kṛiṣhṇa's love and adoration of Rādhā brought Her glory without marriage, while Sītā was denied that public acceptance even though She was the legal wife of Rāma.<br>
Princess Sītā was married to King Rāma in a very traditional way. When He went into exile, Rāvaṇa the rākṣhasa, Satan disguised as an ascetic, appeared before Her and took Her away to the capital of his kingdom in Lanka. Rāma fought a war with Rāvaṇa to rescue His wife, who was secluded by Rāvaṇa in the core of his island kingdom. Rāma defeated His enemy and brought Sītā back to His kingdom, Ayodhyā. Although She was the purest of the pure, and the holiest of the holy, She was treated with suspicion by the citizens of Ayodhyā, Rāma's capital city. They would not accept Her as queen, blaming Her for having been abducted by force by Rāvaṇa. The suspicious citizens questioned Her chastity, and committed collective sin by rejecting Her. Although She was pregnant Rāma was forced to forsake Her. She lived with the Saint Vālmīki in the jungles of Bihar State where She gave birth to twin boys, Lava and Kuśha. They were absolutely human personalities but of very great spiritual heritage from previous births. Sītā taught them the divine way of life. They were later born again in Bihar as Gautama, known as Lord Buddha, and as Śhrī Mahāvīra, the leader of the great religion, Jainism. This all happened 500 years before the birth of Christ. Internally they reached a very great height through these births. They preached the doctrine of nonviolence (<i>ahiṃsā</i>) which was later developed into an extreme form of vegetarianism. They took birth in the warrior caste (<i>Kṣhatriya</i>) rather than as fanatical Brahmins in order to keep away from the extremes of vegetarian abstinences, and to stay more balanced. Still their disciples carried their teachings to the extreme of abstinence and vegetarianism. They confused inner asceticism (<i>saṃnyāsa</i>) with organized institutions of asceticism, and nonviolence with vegetarianism. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was later very much criticized by the so-called vegetarian followers of Buddha and Mahāvīra.<br>
Later They were born in Arabia as Hasan and Husayn, the two sons of Fāṭimah, daughter of Muhammad Sāhib. They were murdered in a very violent war at Karbalāʾ. Their death signifies a great sacrifice in the name of religion. It is an indication how people who are extreme in nature take to fanaticism and, in their blindness, kill the very essence of religion that is born in flesh and blood as an Incarnation. This awakening gave a rude shock to the mass of religious human beings of the land, and there ensued a phenomenon of mass repentance. In this way people were made to realize that there can be no attachment to war for a realized Soul. Violence and nonviolence are attributes of mind but awareness is beyond these extremes. In defense of righteousness one has to go to war, but when one becomes the witness one only sees the play of war without taking any credit or discredit for it, or being disturbed by its aggression.<br>
After Fāṭimah, the Reincarnation of Sītā, died, sectarian war broke out among the Muslims. One side, the Shiya sect, was founded by Her; in Indian dialect Sītā is pronounced 'Shiya'. They are known today as Shiites. Shiya women are regarded as fair, innocent and beautiful because of their motherly expressions; in the same way the women of Janakapur, Sītā's birthplace in India, are similarly blessed by Mahālakṣhmī.<br>
After Her Incarnation as Sītā She was born and lived in China as Kuan Yin [Guānyīn], the Mother of Mercy, as a virgin. Ādi Śhakti took Her first Incarnation in Nepal where still today the Goddess is the presiding national Deity. Most of Her births were on the Himalayas near Nepal where people have mixed Indian and Chinese features. The women of Nepal are mostly fair and soft skinned, and are known to be very serene and beautiful. Because of their high cheek bones they look very young all the time. Ādi Śhakti's facial expression is very much in this mold; to be precise She looks Nepali.<br>
......<br>
When one takes the name of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa one has to take the name of Rādhā first, so a seeker recites the mantra to the Virāṭa as 'Rādhā-Kṛiṣhṇa'. Similarly Sītā's name has to be taken before Rāma's for the mantra 'Sītā-Rāma'. Even the Virgin Mary (<i>Kanyā</i>) who was so quiet and potential at the time of Christ, was recognized later on by His disciples as the Power behind Him. She was worshiped for many years after Her death by early Christians. In modern times human beings who are satanic personalities are challenging the validity of the Primordial Mother's virginity and the Virgin Birth in particular. Mary has clearly shown the power of virginity that can raise a mother to such an exalted powerful position that she can conceive a child by desire alone. She had reached that high stage of evolution when by Her Divine Will, She could immaculately conceive. There are other such instances in Hindu purāṇik literature when Kuntī, by the wish of the Mantra, gave birth to the Pāṇḍavas and to Karṇa immaculately."</font><br>

The dangling chakra moves in a circle around the Nābhī chakra, creating an area called the Ocean of Illusion (Bhavasāgara) or the Void. Lord Viṣhṇu, through His ten Incarnations which represent the ten stages of the evolution of the Primordial Being (Virāṭa), crosses this Void. His seventh Incarnation was as Śhrī Rāma who resides on the right side of the Heart chakra with His Power, Śhrī Sītā. Rāma incarnated as the representation of a personality who was the perfect male human being (<i>Maryādā Puruṣhottama</i>). Lord Viṣhṇu's eighth Incarnation was as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa who, with His Power Rādhā, resides on the Viśhuddhi chakra. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was the ultimate expression of the Primordial Being (Virāṭa) in human form, and taught us to regard the Creation as a play (<i>Līlā</i>) of the Divine Power."</font><br>

<br>
&emsp;1. On the left side of the Chakra, Pārvatī resides with Her husband, Lord Śhiva. He governs the left side channel of Iḍā nāḍī.<br>

&emsp;3. Pārvatī enters alone into the central part of the Chakra as Durgā or Jagadambā, Mother of the World. When Ādi Viṣhṇu incarnated as Lord Rāma, this central part was vacated by Durgā who, in Her role as wife, rejoined Lord Śhiva in the left chamber whilst Lord Rāma with Sītā occupied the central chamber.<br>

<font color="red">"Those people who do not respect their parents and their elders always have a weak Mūlādhāra chakra when they come to Sahaja Yoga. They also have a very weak right Heart center (Anāhata chakra) where Śhrī Rāma resides with His wife, Sītā. If they are particularly unkind to their mothers, then the center and right Heart gets very weak. We must therefore understand just how important our parents are, and how the spiritual link is held in the inner being of personality. Our parents have their roots in the Primordial Parents, and marriage has its roots in their primordial and eternal loving relationship. Those who do not respect their marriage, or enjoy the glory of their chastity, also suffer from a very weak Heart center and Mūlādhāra chakra. In such shameless, sex-obsessed people the Kuṇḍalinī just does not rise."</font><br>

<div class="para-divider"></div>

<p>
<font color="red">"Later on Śhrī Rāma who was one of the Incarnations on this Earth, showed in his own life that he respected people for their aptitude. For example when Śhrī Rāma was exiled and went to a forest, he met there a poor old woman called Śhabarī who was of tribal caste. She offered some berries to Śhrī Rāma with great affection and devotion. She said: "Please eat them because they are not at all sour. I have already tasted them." The food or fruits tasted by somebody else are not to be eaten (uttiṣhṭa). If someone has bitten off even a part of a fruit, that fruit is no longer pure and cannot be offered to another person, certainly not to an Incarnation. But Śhrī Rāma was greatly moved by the love of the old lady. He accepted the berries with much joy and ate them. He praised their taste and gave some to his wife, Sītā. His brother Lakṣhmaṇ, felt rather jealous and asked for some berries for himself. There are many incidents where Śhrī Rām gets very friendly with people who were not of very high castes. Also his own Rāmāyaṇa, his life story, was written by a fisherman who was a dacoit. This fisherman was transformed into a Saint by another heavenly minstrel called Nārada. Of course an ordinary fisherman who was also a dacoit had such respect for Śhrī Rāma that he wrote this beautiful epic, the Rāmāyaṇa."</font><br>
