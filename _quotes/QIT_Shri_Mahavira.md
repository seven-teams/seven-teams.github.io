"Sahaja Yoga is very difficult for the Jains. If the Jains come into Sahaja Yoga they are very difficult people. Because their traditions are very shallow. The people of Ārya Samāj are very shallow people.<br>
Similarly the Buddhists: they believe in the formless but not as far as God is concerned.<br>
<font color="red">Look at this, 'We do not know Buddha. We do not know Muhammad. We have not seen Them. We do not know Mahāvīra. We do not know anyone [of Them]. Who gave us Self-realization? Śhrī Mātājī. That we were able to know because of Śhrī Mātājī.'</font><br>
So, whomever we believe in Them, we will have to believe Them in Śhrī Mātājī itself. Not in Sahaja Yoga."<br>

<font color="red">"Lot of work was done to cross the Void, some success was achieved. And if you people could get it, They are helpful today. They become eternal. The founder of Jaina Dharma, Śhrī Mahāvīra and Śhrī Buddha are amongst Them. They were born of the same Mother, born of the womb of Ādi Śhakti. Try to know Their first relation that where were They born. But it was experimental for all of Them. All of Them made experiments so that human beings could cross the Void. Very few, however, could cross the Void."</font><br>

"Now, what can I say, you would be surprised, that the Shia sect that started after Muhammad Sāhab, His daughter was Fāṭimah, She was also Ādi Śhakti.<br>
<font color="red">And Her two children were, Hasan and Husayn, back then, when They saw even after the annihilation of the world, the human beings did not understand, then They were born as Buddha and Mahāvīra and They brought the non-violence as religion, and attempted that, 'Maybe with the establishment of non-violence people will achieve Self-realization.' But couldn't do it.</font>"<br>

"And His daughter Fāṭimah was nobody else but Sītā Jānakī Herself.<br>
<font color="red">And Her two sons, Hasan and Husayn, were nobody else but Lava and Kuśha. They were born again and again: They were born as Mahāvīra and Buddha, and then They were born as Hasan and Husayn.</font><br>
It is only possible through Sahaja Yoga to realize that this is the Truth, this is the fact."<br>

"Such born realized people: this is a very, very far-fe... fetched stuff. They are very few!<br>
<font color="red">I would say, perhaps, you can Buddha and Mahāvīra are the only two, two human beings in who have gone through many lives. From one extreme to another They went. And ultimately, They found out: that going to the extremes is not proper. Still, They have not reached the complete height of an Incarnation.</font>"<br>

"Now beyond that is God's Realization.<br>
There are three stages to that also, but just now I have told this: the Sat-chit-ānand State.<br>
<font color="red">The God's Realization is the state in which Gautama Buddha and Mahāvīra only rose, and They are settled down here in our brains, both of Them are here, Christ is here.<br>
And these two were not Incarnations. They were born as human beings. They were born to Sītā, as Lav and Kuśh. Then they were born as Buddha and Mahāvīra and Ādi Śhakti was their mother again. Then they were born to Fāṭimah Bi as Hasan and Husayn. They are both placed here in your head and They are the two milestones you have got by which you can know what a human being can rise up to.<br>
Now today they are like Incarnations. Incarnations are beyond but maybe the gap can be bridged.</font>"<br>

"And that's what one has to do: is to place yourself in such a way, 'Let us see.' Keep your minds open to see: what is the Truth about yourself.<br>
Now this Truth has been told by many Great Sages, by Prophets and many Incarnations who came on Earth. <font color="red">As we know Christ has said about it, Nāṇaka has said about it, Kabīra has said, Lao Tze has said, Buddha has said, everyone has said one thing, which is ... people ... which I should say people neglect and are not bothered about it.</font> And the simple thing is, that: 'You have to have your Second Birth. You have to know your Self. you have to have Self-realization.' This every one of them have said it."<br>

"Now, what people are enamored is that, if they see some people dancing madly, they feel enamored. Is a sign that you have not been able to understand.<br>
<font color="red">We have seen Christ, we have seen Buddha, Mahāvīra, Kabīra, Nāṇaka, we had Lao Tze and so many others. Did They behave like this? Did They become mad?</font> We have got Moses, did He become mad anytime? Was He mad anytime, behaving like a mad person?<br>
All these new theories have started, I think, fifty years back, or about sixty years back, that people believe in these new theories and they have forgotten all the kn... traditional things that have come to us, our heritage. And we depend more on these nonsensical things, which has no moorings at all! Because the people who are supposed to be the founders of all the religions, have never behave like this, and why this new type of things that has started? That people are behaving in this manner, and accepting it to be a very normal thing."<br>

"All the Incarnations who came on this Earth were a milestone on the ladder of our evolution. But They all had one type of work to do.<br>
Like the Goddess had to kill the rākṣhasas and save the devotees.<br>
That is why Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa arranged this play. This was all a play. There is no need to be so serious about it. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa won everyone with His sweetness. He explained all our faults in a sweet and roundabout way. It was a very beautiful Incarnation of His.<br>
<font color="red">After Him came Mahāvīra and Buddha, who took an Incarnation of Seriousness. In this seriousness, They spoke of Oneness of the Spirit and the knowledge of the Whole.<br>
Then seriousness developed and the people became serious-minded, and made their daily lives very difficult. In fact neither Buddha nor Mahāvīra had said so.</font>"<br>
