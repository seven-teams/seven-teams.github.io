<font color="red">"Monkeys evolved as integrated animals. The monkey raised the head and stood up. That created a new dimension in animal evolution.

<font color="red">"I have told you many a times and today he also remarked: that you should know you are never alone when you are realized. There have been many people who have been realized, before even you were born, who exist, who are anxious to help you at every moment. In our Śhāstras [Scriptures] we call them Chirañjīvas [eternal beings], you know them. They are people who are Nirañjanas. As he said about Bhairava and Hanumāna. All these people exist, and they are waiting just for a call from you.<br>
Once we went to the market, and there was a problem about something. And I had somebody with Me, a disciple, who was also with Me. I just wanted to see what will be his reaction. He tried to argue out with a person to tell him about something. So he told Me, "Mātājī, let us go now!" When a we came out the shop, I said, "What are you going to about it?" He said, "I have already told Hanumān to look after that part."<br>
And the work was done! It is gross, but it happened."</font><br>

<font color="red">"Take up any work in Sahaja and sākṣhāt Hanumān is standing and he tells Me, 'Mother, with whom should I stand?' Hanumānjī is doing all your work.<br>
Take up any work in the name of your Mother, even of work of the world. For Sahaja Yoga the Five Immortals (Chirañjīvas) are standing there for you.<br>
All these Deities are ready with Their Śhaktis standing in the background for you. And what do They see? That, 'The actor who has come is in very bad shape. He is looking here and there.'<br>
How will the drama go on? This half-baked attitude won't do."</font><br>

<font color="red">"But I see that without properly inviting Deities chakras never work. And these Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, and Maheśh[,] They never listen to [if not properly invited]. Even until you all human beings accept Me [as Śhrī Ādi Śhakti], Śhrī Gaṇeśha, Christ, Hanumāna or Bhairavnāth, no one gets awakened, too. Then every time I have to request Them all [to get awakened]. And here [in overseas countries] these big People [all Deities and gaṇas] they take their attention back. [In] addition to that, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa [is] playing his diplomacy all the time. So unnecessarily you all call Me Mahāmāyā. In reality, all credit goes to you [Mrs. Rāja Kuṃwar] and all these Kings [Deities]. I am just witnessing. Now I do not know how to explain all these to these English people."</font><br>

<font color="red">"Whatever Justice Vaidya has said he is an extremely learned man. I have not read anything in the form of books in My life. Despite reading everything and searching through all books, his vision has a devotion like that of Hanumān that, "It is not there in this too," 'It is not there in these words,' 'This has only signs,' 'I have not got that thing yet,' and as soon as he got it, he recognized it. This is a special kind of devotion.<br>
......<br>
With regards to diseases you know that many have been cured by the disciples themselves, many mental diseases of people have also been cured. This is not something special. This has to happen.<br>
The Temple of God is being cleaned by everyone from Bhairava to Hanumānjī. Whether They exist or not is to be seen by coming into this Kingdom."</font><br>

In English, Hanumānjī is called Gabriel, which means in Christianity, Saint Gabriel, and Bhairavnath is called Saint Michael. It's the same. Absolutely the same. There is no difference. The names are different, all are Hanumānjī."</font><br>

<font color="red">"So in our country, I have also seen that people put Gaṇapatijī's picture, Saraswatījī's picture, and all sorts of images and do namaskāra to them, not knowing who they are, what they are. They go to Hanumānjī's Temple every Tuesday, but who is He, what is His work, if He is awakened within us or not, no one thinks about that.<br>
But when I try to say, then people bring in science and say, "Mātājī, this is unscientific."<br>
Here people talk about the sympathetic system, and there they talk about Gaṇeśhjī. Both are the same, which means that Hanumānjī is taking care of our preconsciousness. He is the ruler of our preconsciousness.<br>
The mind that is before awareness that moves here and there. The awareness or the conscious, which is in the middle before that, is preconscious, which you can call mind. This mind moves here and there, going towards ego and superego, towards the brain, and from the brain goes towards ego and superego. This restless mind is taken care of by Hanumānjī.<br>
You have to proceed carefully with Hanumānjī's Power. He does the planning, and He tells us about the future, and He is the guru of it.<br>
[Whether] He is present or not, you will find out today. "</font><br>

<font color="red">"Before man came into being he existed at the monkey stage. Monkeys had also been struggling in their evolutionary process. To help them, the Primordial Preconscious Mind of the Virāṭa Itself took Incarnation as Hanumāna, the Monkey God, the devotee of Śhrī Viṣhṇu. Hanumāna led the monkeys who were half human -- 'the missing link' as Darwin called it in human evolution. The monkeys were helped to evolve into human beings."</font><br>

<font color="red">"$\bullet$ Monkeys evolved as integrated animals. The monkey raised the head and stood up. That created a new dimension in animal evolution. The missing links, half man and half monkey, existed on this Earth. They evolved and became angelic identities like Hanumāna and Bhairava. "</font><br>

<font color="red">"It is said that God made the creation in seven days. Monday is the day of Ādi Śhakti, and also of Lord Śhiva. Tuesday is the day realized Souls (Sahaja Yogis) should worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha in the Mūlādhāra chakra. Hanumāna, who controls the preconscious mind (<i>chetan mana</i>), should also be worshiped on Tuesday.<br>
......<br>
Śhrī Gaṇeśha surrounds the left half circle of the Void, while His brother Kārttikeya surrounds the right half of the circle. They reunite below the Heart chakra. From this point, the Monkey God Hanumāna, who is created to be the guiding angel of the Preconscious Mind of the Virāṭa, sits on the right-hand channel of Piṅgalā, which manifests as the right sympathetic nervous system. This Deity takes the form of Saint Gabriel above the Viśhuddhi chakra following Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's Incarnation."</font><br>
<font size="+0"><b>The Book of Ādi Śhakti, Chapter 12: Mūlādhāra Chakra</b></font>
</p>

<div class="para-divider"></div>

<p>
<font color="red">"This is the expression of the activating mood of Ādi Śhakti, the rajoguṇa in Her aspect as Mahāsaraswatī. She acts through the Ādi Piṅgalā Nāḍī, whose Presiding Deity is Brahmadeva. This channel originates on the left side of the brain of the Primordial Being (<i>Virāṭa Śharīra</i>), and passes through the Ādi Āgñyā Chakra towards the right side of the Great Being's Body. In the Primordial Brain it forms the Universal Mind that thinks, organizes and creates the material side of creation. Hanumāna, the Monkey Deity, moves on this channel and represents the Preconscious Mind of the Virāṭa. <br>
......<br>
Realized Souls who have reached the stage of God-realization, and on whom Brahmadeva bestows His Powers are very rare and never show off their tricks or <i>siddhis</i>, because these powers are not very important to them. This includes Deities and Incarnations like Hanumāna and Jesus Christ. These powers come to them as a part of their nature, and through them they can control the Sun, and the rain and other elements by the Grace of Brahmadeva.<br>
Powers like flying through the air, floating on water, being buried underground, stopping the sunrise or drinking up the oceans can also be performed with the help of disembodied spirits. It is easy to distinguish real Siddhas from impostors. Siddhas never use their powers for their betterment or fame or material well-being. "</font><br>
