"<font color="red">As you must have heard of Rāja Balī [Mahābalī or Māveli] when Vāmana Avatār occurred. Rāja Balī was said to be religious person.</font> [<b>Variant:</b> <font color="red">You must have heard about king Bali when Vāmana Incarnation took place. Rāja Balī was a religious person.</font>] But he did Yagñya.<br>
For getting creative powers people do Yagñya.<br>
......<br>
If we acquire it without the shadow of dharma, then it can also have a negative impact as in Rāja Balī.<br>
When Viśhwāmitra asked Rāja Balī to do tapa, he asked Brahmadev to grant a wish that he can destroy all the Devas.<br>
<font color="red">After that, you know Vāmana Incarnation took place. About Vāmana Incarnation we know that our powers in the middle, which we call Sattvaguṇa Powers, which are Powers of Lord Viṣhṇu, the powers because of which we became humans from amoeba, that power took Incarnation to restore the balance.</font><br>
......<br>
<font color="red">In the old time when the torture of Balī increased, Vāmana Avatar came to kill him.</font>"<br>

<font color="red">"Just as fish still exist today, elephants too, some evolution continues slowly. We can say that up to seven evolutions [it continues].<br>
The first evolution was when the Supreme Being had to be in human form, which was the Vāmana Avatār, a small man. He first showed that humans can conquer all [the] three realms. It means that humans can conquer the five elements. This is the Vāmana Avatār."</font><br>

<font color="red">"Afterwards, we can say, that the Incarnation of the center, this green color center, which we cap ... call as the Nābhī chakra, the Incarnations started on this point, one after another, taking different forms of living animals in the evolution. Like first the fish: It came as a fish. They say, when Noah was having a bad time with the deluge, this fish helped him. They came as an Incarnation, that aspect of God which we call as evolutionary. That came as a fish on this Earth, and then, then It came as a quadruped. Then It came as a short man. That It came as a strong man. And on and on and on like that till we reached a stage where the top one, you can see, or here. This is the stage where Śhrī Rām, who came eight thousand years back. This was established within us like a milestone. They were the leaders of our evolution. They led us into evolution as well as They left a mark for us there, and They exist within us in that path."</font><br>

"But there is another guidance which has come to us from God. This is very much believed into in India. Even in the Western world, if they follow Christianity or Judaism, they believe in it. It is believed that [pointing to the Chakra Chart:] at that spot is, resides the Power of God which evolves.<br>
<font color="red">This area, according to Indian mythology, is governed by a Power called Lakṣhmī, which on one side gives us our sustainance [sustenance] and on the other side guides it [us] how to behave.<br>
And from the same Power, the Male Form of that Power incarnates, again and again, to guide the people, in human form.<br>
This Incarnation in the beginning was a fish, when we were fishes. When we were tortoises, It was a tortoise, when we were reptiles It was a tortoise. Then we were quadrupeds, we ... It was a boar. Then later on It became half man and half uh half lion. Then It became a small man, short man. Then It became the very strong man, Paraśhurāma. Then He came as Śhrī Rāma. At His completion, He came as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.</font>"<br>

"And Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa incarnated as one of the Incarnations of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, who is responsible for our evolutionary process.<br>
It is only through Śhrī Viṣhṇu that we evolve. He is the aspect which gives us dharma: dharma is our sustainance [sustenance]. Through changing our sustainances [sustenances] or our capacities we have evolved.<br>
<font color="red">Like, I can say, carbon was at Mūlādhāra chakra. And this carbon achieved matter got Prāṇa into it, by which it started moving as a living thing. This living thing then grew into higher and higher awareness, till it reached a ... reached a stage where you were an animal and then you had to become a human being. The first human beings were short people. That Incarnation of ... Incarnation of the short people is called as Vāmana.</font>"<br>

"Then the sustainance [sustenance] start[s] growing till you become a human being as shown [points to the Chakra Chart:] here. In this Void, [points to Mūlādhāra chakra:] here as carbon, then you move into the Void. <font color="red">And here you go through all the evolution starting from a fish up to the human level where you become a small man. Once you become the small man, Vāmana is called that. First the man who came on the Earth was a small statured man. Then a man came who was Paraśhurāma, a very, very ... Poseidon, a very large man, huge man. Two extremes. And then came the man who was in the center.</font><br>

"So this center, we come to, of our evolution, is presided by the Preserver, the aspect of preservation: He's the Father who looks after us, He's the One who gives us our well-being. He comes on this Earth again and again, in different forms. According to Indian Purāṇas, the Ark of Noah was saved by a fish, which was a dolphin. And this dolphin fish was this aspect which incarnated. Then the second aspect came as the tortoise. Then the third as a quadruped.<br>
Like that they have described the evolution, how these Incarnations had to come to break the barriers of the evolutionary ignorance. These are the people who came for the breakthrough. <font color="red">Ultimately, a short man was created called as Vāmana</font>, then a very fiery, big man, He's called as Passidon [Poseidon], or in Greek language."<br>

"So, at the time, first time the Incarnation as a human being came on this Earth, as we say of this sustainance [sustenance], was of Śhrī Rāma.<br>
<font color="red">But before that was uh-uh Vāmana Avatāra, which is the short man, a very short [man]. I mean, first the man was created as a short man. He is the first one as Vāmana Avatāra. And that One came as a leader, the first one was Vāmana Avatāra, and He was given the power ... He was given the blessings that He can spread into three worlds: so, into, into the higher worlds, into the lower worlds, and into the central world.<br>
That's how human beings uh got distributed into these three worlds. And a big, you see, problem started.<br>
Like the house that moves wild, you know. Then it goes amok. Then you have to get all the things collected, put them right.<br>
The original sin is the big problem. The biggest problem was that.<br>
Now to solve it up, one had to do all these things.<br>
So first the Vāmana Avatāra came.</font><br>
<font color="red">After the Vāmana Avatāra came the Incarnation of a very tall and a hefty man. That was Paraśhurāma.</font> That I don't know, in the Greek philosophy, if Zeus was Paraśhurāma, because it sounds like Zeus. Because Paraśhurāma is contemporary of Rāma Himself. Because somebody had to announce. You see, it is necessary that somebody must announce the Advent, at that time it was necessary. So Paraśhurāma came. The tall and a hefty man, who came on this Earth, maybe Zeus is called. I mean they are so confused that, you see, to ... to relate this to that, is another confusion. I don't know how. But looks like Zeus."<br>

Śhrī Rāma resides on the right side, as the Father [Principle], right side of the Heart."</font><br>

<font color="red">"Another one is Hariśhchandra, who had a guest who came as Vāmana, It's means Śhrī Viṣhṇu to take his test. And the, He asked for all his kingdom. So, Hariśhchandra gave Him all his kingdom and went into the forest with his wife and suffered a lot. But in that sufferings, he got his Mokṣha. And he got again complete reward of his kingdom and everything, is very much purified.<br>
And also there is a case of uh this coming to a king uh Śhrī Viṣhṇu as Vāmana. And the He asked that, ``You have to give Me land which is uh ... which could be measured by My three steps." Bali was his name. He said: ``All right. Whatever You say." So with one foot He touched the sky, with another foot He touched the Mother Earth. With the third foot, He put Bali's head and put him in the Pātāla, in the uh lower [<font color="orange">unclear</font>], lower world. And that's how Vāmana Avatāra came soon."</font><br>

<font color="red">"But as human beings have evolved, even the Deities have evolved Themselves accordingly. So it was a fish, and then, then a tortoise, and like that, it went on, till we come to the stage of Vāmana Avatāra where it was a small man, then a big man, a tall, big man, a Greek, who we call as Zeus, is Paraśhurāma. And then came Śhrī Rā... Śhrī Rām."</font><br>

"Like, if Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa had not come we would not have known really the significance of spiritual life. He was the first who talked of spiritual life.<br>
Rāma did not talk of spiritual life, though there was an undercurrent in India. People knew there is spiritual life because there were Saints, there were uh-uh lots of uh-uh-uh, what you call the, uh-uh-uh Seers, all of them were talking about it. But no Incarnation talked about spiritual life.<br>
<font color="red">We had Vāmana Avatāra, then we had Paraśhurāma, we had so many of these people, never, never They talked of spiritual life, never.</font><br>
It was Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa only who first started talking about spiritual life, and only to Arjuna He talked. Because, you see, what was the condition: people were not prepared."<br>

He took the form of the Short Man (Vāmana Avatāra) who came on this Earth to give leadership to people seeking God. Vāmana was enlightened with the idea that He could capture the three worlds (<i>Triloka</i>): Earth (<i>Pṛithvī</i>), Heaven (<i>Ākāśha</i>) and Hell (<i>Pātāla</i>, the subconscious). So in corollary, this Incarnation brought forth the idea in the human mind that man can overpower all three worlds.</b> It should be understood that Ādi Viṣhṇu's Incarnations, the line of evolution, lead the way towards higher, deeper and wider spiritual awareness which is the true index by which the development of the Creation can be measured.
