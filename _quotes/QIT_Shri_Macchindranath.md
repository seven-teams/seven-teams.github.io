<font color="DarkRed">"Macchinder Nath an incarnation of Primordial Guru started Nath Pantha.</font> Even after some decades these were very few real Gurus (Avadhuta[s)] left in this cult. The deterioration started. Tankrikas [tantrikas] who imposed themselves as Gurus took charge of the cult in Many places."<br>

"Now about this power ... in our country many people knew about this for ages and they were called true Masters (Sadguru). These people had attained this knowledge through very hard penance.<br>
A power named as Kuṇḍalinī resides in our triangular bone. And we call it Kuṇḍalinī because it's [it] sits in the shape of three and a half coil. It is very surprising that even Greeks knew about this. Because the triangular bone where Kuṇḍalinī resides, they call it sacrum bone. It means there is this sacred bone within us. Not sure, if many of these things they adopted from us or they attained this knowledge themselves in sahaja way.<br>
<font color="DarkRed">In our country, experimentations to achieve Self-realization have been going on for ages. In Maharashtra [India] there have been people belonging to Nāth sect like Macchindranāth, Gorakhnāth, etc., these people were all into this.</font>"<br>

"To make the people cross the Void (Bhavasāgara) He has to make some arrangement. So the Great Power like Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, Maheśha was created and They were placed in the Area of Dharma.<br>
Dattātreya and Ādi Gurus incarnated in this world many a times. He incarnated as King Janaka who was like the father of Ādi Śhakti. <font color="DarkRed">After that He incarnated in Iran as Zoroaster, then as Macchindranāth, then as Muhammad Sāheb and Nāṇak Sāheb.</font><br>

"Śhrī Dattātreya's Incarnations are numerous. Firstly He came as King Janaka. Śhrī Sītājī was His daughter, who was the embodiment of Śhakti Herself. <font color="DarkRed">Then He came as Macchindranāth, Zoroaster, and Muhammad Sāhab, who were a completely different type of human being.</font><br>
They trialed out lots of different things.<br>
Śhrī Datta, the Primordial Masters firstly in this world educated us about the symbolic forms within us. And then also said that, "You people got entangled in symbolism, in idol worshiping." Their meaning was to go beyond and recognize the Śhakti within these idols. That's why They talked about the idols."<br>

"The same Śhrī Dattā incarnated many a times on the Earth.<br>
As I told you yesterday, King Janaka was one of Them. King Janaka was the father of Jānakī [Śhrī Sītā]. He was none other than the Incarnation of Śhrī Dattātreya.<br>
<font color="DarkRed">Thereafter, Macchindranāth, most have you must have heard His name, was also His Incarnation.</font><br>
After that Zoroaster who came three times on the Earth, He was also His Incarnation.<br>
After that Muhammad Sāhab, who was His Incarnation.<br>
And when He was asked that, "Bhāī [Brother], there must have been others also before You," then He replied, "Yes, there [was] a Muhammad." Then again He was asked who was before Him. He replied, "There was one Muhammad."<br>
Muhammad means Praise, the One who is praised, the One who deserves to be praised and is the One who is Redeemer of the world.<br>
They were all Muhammads, They were all Dattātreyas, who came on Earth regularly.<br>
After that [was] Nāṇaka, Guru Nāṇaka. If you ever read His teachings, if you read His talks then you will be surprised that He has always talked in a Sahaja. He has said, "Sahaja Samādhi lago." He has said, "Kāhe re ban khojan jāe, Sarab nivāsī sadā alepā tohī saṃg[a] samāī, Puṣhpamadhya jo bāsa basata hai mukara māhī jaise chhāī, Taise hī harī base niraṃtara ghaṭa hī khojo bhāī." ["Why to go to forest to find Him, He is always there with you just like there is a fragrance in a flower and just as the reflection is there in a mirror, in the same way God is residing in you eternally, seek Him within."] He is just inside, achieve Him just inside. We are just singing poem, singing songs, we are just cramming His prescription.<br>
The talk of seeking this Absolute Principle, residing just inside the heart, has been made since ancient times by these Ādi Gurus, who are incarnated on this Earth again and again.<br>
......<br>
Now just look at Gaganagaḍ Mahārāj, it is true that he cured many people, but the problem is that his fingers moved inside like a telescope and those of feet also. The poor man lives on a tree or moves on a lion. Apart from this he cannot move anywhere. But when I reached to him, these people were with Me, he quickly recognized Me. There is no doubt about it. He has not yet seen Me in this lifetime. But from many years he knew about Me. He is elder to Me. He began to say, "Mother, I have been waiting for you for many years. Today I am so fortunate that you have come here." <font color="DarkRed">He is a Nāth Pānthi, so he is just like Macchindranāth and a very great person.</font>"<br>

"Now, we have had great Saints in our country, no doubt.<br>
Even a person like Gyāneśhwara, was a great Saint we have [had]. <font color="DarkRed">And He was in the same line as Macchindranāth, Gorakhnāth, then Gyānināth, and then His father [brother] there was Nivṛuttināth, and He initiated Him. And we had a Great Guru paramparā, Guru tradition in a ... that Nāth Pānthis.</font><br>
Even He, Gyāneśhwara, who was a realized Soul, no doubt, and His brother was really a very great Saint. Even He, when He writes about [the] Kuṇḍalinī awakening, He doesn't do the way you Sahaja Yogis [<font color="orange">unclear</font>].<br>
That I wish you could read Marathi, I could make you understand now.<br>
And how He has raised the Kuṇḍalinī, what happens: He could give Realization to two people in His lifetime. See?"<br>

"Dattātreya is the innocence of all these Three Powers.<br>
And this Guru uh was the One whose ... who then had a big tradition of Gurus.<br>
In the same tradition, we had many Gurus in our country. And, specially, in the area near Bombay [Mumbai], which is called as Maharashtra, they came as Nāth. They are, they were called as Nāth.<br>
<font color="DarkRed">So the first one was Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], then ahh Dattātreya, then Macchindranāth, then Gorakhnāth, like that a tradition of these Gurus came.</font><br>
But all Their knowledge was kept as a guarded secret. It was a Gupta Vidyā. Is absolutely guarded secret: secret knowledge about Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
They never talked about it, they never told about it. Because they thought: that, 'Just now, let us experiment with it fully, and then we will give some idea about it to people.' "<br>

"But I was surprised that in Kiev, which is the capital of Ukraine, I went to see the museum: is full of paintings of Kuṇḍalinī and of the chakras, different chakras. I was amazed: 'How could it be?'<br>
<font color="DarkRed">And then they said that, "Two thousand before Christ [2000 B.C.], two S-Saints came from India," and they told Me the name and I was a... amazed how they knew the names of those people: Macchindranāth and Gorakhnāth.</font><br>
That time I think America didn't exist, otherwise they would have come here also. [Laughter.]<br>
<font color="DarkRed">And these two people went there. And they taught them all about Kuṇḍalinī, but they said, "We didn't know how to raise, we didn't know how to achieve it. So, we just knew it, but we didn't know how to do it.</font>"<br>
Same in India: Gyāneśhwara has written about it.<br>
But much before that, thirteen thousand years back, another Saint, Mārkaṇḍeya, has written about it.<br>
Then in the sixth century, Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya has written about it.<br>
And it has been written by many people. In the sixteenth century, so many Saints have written about.<br>
In the Bible also it is there, that, "I'll appear before you like tongues of flames," and these are the chakras that you see."<br>

He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā).
