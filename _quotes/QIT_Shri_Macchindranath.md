<font color="red">"Macchinder Nath an incarnation of Primordial Guru started Nath Pantha.</font> Even after some decades these were very few real Gurus (Avadhuta[s)] left in this cult. The deterioration started. Tankrikas [tantrikas] who imposed themselves as Gurus took charge of the cult in Many places."<br>

"Now about this power ... in our country many people knew about this for ages and they were called true Masters (Sadguru). These people had attained this knowledge through very hard penance.<br>
A power named as Kuṇḍalinī resides in our triangular bone. And we call it Kuṇḍalinī because it's [it] sits in the shape of three and a half coil. It is very surprising that even Greeks knew about this. Because the triangular bone where Kuṇḍalinī resides, they call it sacrum bone. It means there is this sacred bone within us. Not sure, if many of these things they adopted from us or they attained this knowledge themselves in sahaja way.<br>
<font color="red">In our country, experimentations to achieve Self-realization have been going on for ages. In Maharashtra [India] there have been people belonging to Nāth sect like Macchindranāth, Gorakhnāth, etc., these people were all into this.</font>"<br>

Dattātreya and Ādi Gurus incarnated in this world many a times. He incarnated as King Janaka who was like the father of Ādi Śhakti. <font color="red">After that He incarnated in Iran as Zoroaster, then as Macchindranāth, then as Muhammad Sāheb and Nāṇak Sāheb.</font><br>

"Śhrī Dattātreya's Incarnations are numerous. Firstly He came as King Janaka. Śhrī Sītājī was His daughter, who was the embodiment of Śhakti Herself. <font color="red">Then He came as Macchindranāth, Zoroaster, and Muhammad Sāhab, who were a completely different type of human being.</font><br>
They trialed out lots of different things.<br>
Śhrī Datta, the Primordial Masters firstly in this world educated us about the symbolic forms within us. And then also said that, "You people got entangled in symbolism, in idol worshiping." Their meaning was to go beyond and recognize the Śhakti within these idols. That's why They talked about the idols."<br>

"The same Śhrī Dattā incarnated many a times on the Earth.<br>
As I told you yesterday, King Janaka was one of Them. King Janaka was the father of Jānakī [Śhrī Sītā]. He was none other than the Incarnation of Śhrī Dattātreya.<br>
<font color="red">Thereafter, Macchindranāth, most have you must have heard His name, was also His Incarnation.</font><br>
After that Zoroaster who came three times on the Earth, He was also His Incarnation.<br>
After that Muhammad Sāhab, who was His Incarnation.<br>
And when He was asked that, "Bhāī [Brother], there must have been others also before You," then He replied, "Yes, there [was] a Muhammad." Then again He was asked who was before Him. He replied, "There was one Muhammad."<br>
Muhammad means Praise, the One who is praised, the One who deserves to be praised and is the One who is Redeemer of the world.<br>
They were all Muhammads, They were all Dattātreyas, who came on Earth regularly.<br>
After that [was] Nāṇaka, Guru Nāṇaka. If you ever read His teachings, if you read His talks then you will be surprised that He has always talked in a Sahaja. He has said, "Sahaja Samādhi lago." He has said, "Kāhe re ban khojan jāe, Sarab nivāsī sadā alepā tohī saṃg[a] samāī, Puṣhpamadhya jo bāsa basata hai mukara māhī jaise chhāī, Taise hī harī base niraṃtara ghaṭa hī khojo bhāī." ["Why to go to forest to find Him, He is always there with you just like there is a fragrance in a flower and just as the reflection is there in a mirror, in the same way God is residing in you eternally, seek Him within."] He is just inside, achieve Him just inside. We are just singing poem, singing songs, we are just cramming His prescription.<br>
The talk of seeking this Absolute Principle, residing just inside the heart, has been made since ancient times by these Ādi Gurus, who are incarnated on this Earth again and again.<br>
......<br>
Now just look at Gaganagaḍ Mahārāj, it is true that he cured many people, but the problem is that his fingers moved inside like a telescope and those of feet also. The poor man lives on a tree or moves on a lion. Apart from this he cannot move anywhere. But when I reached to him, these people were with Me, he quickly recognized Me. There is no doubt about it. He has not yet seen Me in this lifetime. But from many years he knew about Me. He is elder to Me. He began to say, "Mother, I have been waiting for you for many years. Today I am so fortunate that you have come here." <font color="red">He is a Nāth Pānthi, so he is just like Macchindranāth and a very great person.</font>"<br>

"And He actually came to do work of Sahaja Yoga in that area.<br>
Maharashtra is a very good area for one reason: is a part of India where, since long, a group of people have been working on these lines of the Ādi Guru. They were called as Avadhūtas. And they started with Macchindranāth, you see, a Primordial Master was born as Macchindranāth.<br>
And they started working on very people in the villages, or you can say in the hills and valleys. We can call them that they were like ascetics, separated, just dedicated to find out the Truth.<br>
And these people, but very few of them, they started working it out.<br>
Like the ... you can say the Kaśhyapas of the Zen system.<br>
And they went into the various countries -- even Macchindranāth, His ... His disciple was Gorakhnāth -- they all went into various countries to find out: 'What is the problem, and how it is to be worked out.'<br>

"Now, we have had great Saints in our country, no doubt.<br>
Even a person like Gyāneśhwara, was a great Saint we have [had]. <font color="red">And He was in the same line as Macchindranāth, Gorakhnāth, then Gyānināth, and then His father [brother] there was Nivṛuttināth, and He initiated Him.

But all Their knowledge was kept as a guarded secret. It was a Gupta Vidyā. Is absolutely guarded secret: secret knowledge about Kuṇḍalinī.<br>

<b>Version 1:</b><br>
"I am very surprised that from India people like Macchindranāth, Gorakhnāth, who used to talk about Kuṇḍalinī, traveled to places like Bolivia, several thousand years back, which is a very difficult place for us to reach. They went to Ukraine and also to some parts of Russia. And after going there they explained to people that, 'This Kuṇḍalinī Śhakti is inside you and all the chakras are present inside your system.'</font><br>
And we people who are their progeny do not know anything about Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
The natives of Bolivia know everything about Kuṇḍalinī but they say that they do not know how to awaken the Kuṇḍalinī, though they are aware of the existence of Kuṇḍalinī. I went to Bolivia only once, and many thousands of people got Self-realization instantly.<br>
But we people do not have any knowledge of this, and no one tells us about it, nor it is mentioned in any of our books. It is as if we have been completely severed from that great culture and the great knowledge, and we ourselves do not know what kind of peculiar human beings we have become. We are neither Indians nor English. We do not know to which country we belong to. People also do not know the meaning of Kuṇḍalinī. Just imagine, people do not know what is this Kuṇḍalinī which has an ocean-like knowledge inside it."<br>
<b>Version 3:</b><br>
"I am not saying this Myself. It has been described by old Sages for centuries. People used to talk about Self-realization a thousand years ago.<br>
People like Macchindranāth and Gorakhnāth reached countries like Bolivia at that time. Even today it is not easy to reach Bolivia. They went to Ukraine also, and some parts of Russia, and told people that they have this Power within themselves. They gave the knowledge of the chakras.<br>
We are their descendants. What do we know? We know nothing. People in Bolivia know all about the subtle system but they did not know how to enlighten the Power of Kuṇḍalinī. We know all the rest.<br>
When I went there [in Bolivia] it was spreading like fire. They got their Self-realization in huge numbers.<br>
Here in India we have no knowledge about our subtle system, nor it is written in our modern books. Nobody shares this knowledge. It is like we are disconnected, disassociated from this Great Knowledge, and after disassociation from this knowledge, we became mad people of a very different country. We are not Westerners or Indians. We turned into something strange. We have no knowledge. People ask Me whether Kuṇḍalinī and kuṇḍalī [horoscope] are the same. Nobody has this knowledge. Imagine: this country is the real ocean of knowledge, an ocean full of knowledge."<br>

<font color="red">"So you need to tell the whole world that they should join Sahaja Yoga, to get their Kuṇḍalinī awakened.<br>
Everybody is aware of Kuṇḍalinī right from Macchindranāth to Gorakhnāth, as all these people have worked on Kuṇḍalinī. There are books on Kuṇḍalinī, but the knowledge has remained within the books, it has not spread out to other people.<br>
You should tell people about Sahaja Yoga and the rising of the Kuṇḍalinī."</font><br>

"Many Saints from our country went to other countries. <font color="red">I think Macchindranāth and Gorakhnāth also went to many countries.</font><br>
Bolivian people know about them. They know the names of the chakras and also they know about Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
I have seen, in the ancient paintings of the Russia, they have painted plexuses. If you travel a little in this country [Russia], then you will be surprised that how and from where have they known about it! Decidedly some of our Saints might have gone there and told about every thing."<br>

<font color="red">"But for this, we must know: this is the knowledge of our country.<br>
Not that others didn't know: they knew.<br>
But what uh in Bolivia, I was surprised, Bolivia is so far off, people told Me, "We know all about chakras, we knew everything. But we don't know how to raise the Kuṇḍalinī." But they knew the word Kuṇḍalinī also.<br>
So-oo-oo, I thought: "I must find out: 'Who has told you all this?' " Two Saints came from India long, long time back. 'Maybe,' I thought, `Macchindranāth and Gorakhnāth had gone everywhere.'<br>
They went to Ukraine also.<br>
So they might have told them about this Kuṇḍalinī and the awakening of the Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
But, they said, "We don't know how to raise the Kuṇḍalinī."<br>
Once you are entitled uh-uh-uh as S-s-sahaja Yogi, you can raise the Kuṇḍalinī of any person: you can cure any person, you can do whatever you want to do, as far as the physical side is concerned, even the mental side."</font><br>

"In Africa, I was surprised: that they have talked about Kuṇḍalinī. They have! And I have seen some of the maps, old maps, of Africa, they have made the picture of Kuṇḍalinī also, all over.<br>
Even in a place like Bolivia, which is so far away, and the somebody went to Bolivia, from Italy, and he said, "Mother they know everything about Kuṇḍalinī!" I said, "Really?" "Yes, they know, but they don't know how to awaken It."<br>
And sprea... Sahaja Yoga has spread so much in Bolivia: the Minister from there came to see Me.<br>
And who told them? I said, "Who told them?" They said, "There were two Saints who came from India."<br>
Even in Ukraine, I was surprised, they said, "There were two Saints who came here from India, they told us about Kuṇḍalinī."<br>
Chinese people, they believe that there is a treasure of spirituality in India, but they don't know what it is, you see.<br>
<font color="red">But these two, I don't know, there were two Saints known as Macchindranāth and Gorakhnāth who have been traveling all over the world. But I don't know if they went all the way [smiling:] over there.</font>"<br>

"<font color="red">The Primordial Master was also born as Macchindranāth, and again as Zoroaster who was worshiped by the ancient Persians, and still revered by Parsis.</font> Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism. In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates. He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā). Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918. Altogether there were ten major Avatāras of Dattātreya."<br>

"<font color="red">Macchindranāth, an Incarnation of Dattātreya, the Primordial Master, started <i>Nāth Pāntha</i>.</font> There were some very feared gurus (<i>Avadhūtas</i>) of this cult even decades later. Its deterioration started, though, when tāntrikas imposed themselves as gurus, and took over the cult in many places. These fake gurus were criticized by the great Saint Kabīr Dās in His poems."<br>

"In this Void is placed the Primordial Master (Ādi Guru) formed from Brahmā, Viṣhṇu and Maheśha (Śhiva). This Primordial Master is also known as Dattātreya. <font color="red">He has taken many human births as a Prophet and teacher, such as Rāja Janaka, Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], Macchindranāth, Zoroaster, Guru Nāṇaka, and Sāī Nāth of Śhirḍī.</font> This Deity helps human beings to seek their salvation by crossing the Void or Ocean of Illusion within themselves."<br>
