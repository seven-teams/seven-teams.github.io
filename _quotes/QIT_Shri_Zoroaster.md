"To make the people cross the Void (Bhavasāgara) He has to make some arrangement. So the Great Power like Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, Maheśha was created and They were placed in the Area of Dharma.<br>
<font color="red">Dattātreya and Ādi Gurus incarnated in this world many a times. He incarnated as King Janaka who was like the father of Ādi Śhakti. After that He incarnated in Iran as Zoroaster, then as Macchindranāth, then as Muhammad Sāheb and Nāṇak Sāheb.</font><br>
No one fought with each other. See what type of darkness you are in?<br>
Fāṭimah, the daughter of Muhammad Sāheb was the same who became daughter of King Janaka.<br>
Whom are you fighting? Think over it.<br>
The Nāṇakī of Guru Nāṇaka was none else but Jānakī.<br>
Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth was also an Ādi Guru.<br>
<font color="red">They are the Masters of all.<br>
Also, They are My Gurus. These Ādi Gurus taught Me all this Knowledge. In different Incarnations They kept Me teaching.<br> 
Ultimately I had to come and do His work. They could not do it and now They are placing Me as a Guru so that I take up the job of a Guru.<br>
There was an age when no one was willing to accept a woman as a Guru but in Kali Yuga only Mother could do His work: it is beyond the power of men.</font><br>
This work could not be done by force, only the love of a Mother could do it because already there is so much pressure, tension in this world. The day it is forced upon the human being they will break down. So, love is the only way out.<br>
So this Gurudom was given to Me. Everything is acceptable to Me.<br>
But I didn't know the qualities of a Guru.<br>
Gurus maintain distance but mother does not keep distance with the children. Children sit on her head.<br>
So, you people also could take liberty with Me and enjoy. Be with Me with full freedom, you will neither be afraid nor be embarrassed. There is no problem, you could come and talk to Me boldly about your problems. You could complain to Me as you do to your mother. I am freely available to you.<br>
Freedom was needed, religion was required to be discussed openly, there is no secret, no secret about it. Ultimately everything has to be explained very clearly. All the secrets are to be told about, everything could not be said everywhere."<br>

"But before reaching the Heart chakra, the gap I showed you, is all the Bhavasāgara. In the center is the seat of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, and on it Śhrī Brahmadeva creates the whole universe. He made this Bhavasāgara.<br>
After creating the Bhavasāgara, the question was, 'How to cross it over? The human being was created, but how to make him realize it? How to make human beings recognize it? In him, how to activate the Brahma Tattwa?' Meaning, 'How to get the Union of Śhiva and Śhakti within him? How would the connection be established?'<br>
For this, a special personality was created in this world. This was created by the combined essence of Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, and Maheśh, who we acknowledge as Śhrī Dattātreya. Śhrī Dattātreya is none other than Ādi Guru.<br>
He is My Guru. He has mentored Me all His past lives.<br>
If you hear about His birth and all His previous lives you would be amazed. We have forgotten such a great thing.<br>
Śhrī Dattātreya's Incarnations are numerous. Firstly He came as King Janaka. Śhrī Sītājī was His daughter, who was the embodiment of Śhakti Herself. <font color="red">Then He came as Macchindranāth, Zoroaster, and Muhammad Sāhab, who were a completely different type of human being.<br>
They trialed out lots of different things.</font><br> 
Śhrī Datta, the Primordial Masters firstly in this world educated us about the symbolic forms within us. And then also said that, "You people got entangled in symbolism, in idol worshiping." Their meaning was to go beyond and recognize the Śhakti within these idols. That's why They talked about the idols.<br>
<font color="red">For example, there is a flower, and to describe the honey within the flower, They talked about the flower first, from which the people would taste the honey. But people got stuck to flower. So Then they took Incarnations and talked about the honey.<br>
In that, They talked about God in the abstract. They deliberately didn't talk about the reincarnation of life.</font><br>
Because as soon as you talk about past lives, people ask Me, "Mātājī, tell me about my past lives." The life that has passed, why do you want to know that? Whether you were a king or a pauper, what difference it will make?<br>
<font color="red">That's why They did not discuss past lives.</font><br>
Muhammad Sāhab was the same, Dattātreya's Incarnation, and the same Incarnation was King Janaka. The same Incarnation was Nāṇaka, whose sister Nāṇakī, was the same Ādi Śhakti. She was Sītājī."<br>

"The same Śhrī Dattā incarnated many a times on the Earth.<br>
As I told you yesterday, King Janaka was one of Them. King Janaka was the father of Jānakī [Śhrī Sītā]. He was none other than the Incarnation of Śhrī Dattātreya.<br>
Thereafter, Macchindranāth, most have you must have heard His name, was also His Incarnation.<br>
<font color="red">After that Zoroaster who came three times on the Earth, He was also His Incarnation.</font><br>
......<br> 
<font color="red">They were all Muhammads, They were all Dattātreyas, who came on Earth regularly.</font><br>
......<br>
<font color="red">The talk of seeking this Absolute Principle, residing just inside the heart, has been made since ancient times by these Ādi Gurus, who are incarnated on this Earth again and again."</font><br>

"But in some people that stability has to be brought about. No problem. You have obtained that thing, you recognized it, you reached there and there is a complete arrangement for bringing stability.<br>
<font color="red">As soon as that stability is achieved, in Absolute Peace and Joy, you achieve that Witness State described by Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, by Jesus, by all the Scriptures whether by Zoroaster, Socrates, Confucius or any of Dattātreya's Incarnations.</font><br>
Till today, these people who were of a higher state, who would take birth in a higher state, would talk in a manner that others were unable to understand. They could see matters of the tenth floor and others would remain on the first floor and they would just not understand what was being talked about."<br>

"Another thing is, here in Bhavasāgar, all Three, Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, Maheśhwar, combined to make a child, who is called Ādi Guru, is known as Dattātreya. There were many Incarnations of Him. And His Child Tattwa also took Incarnations. First was Dattātreya, then came Rāja Janak. <font color="red">Like this, many Incarnations came, Rāja Janak, Nāṇak, Zarathustra, Muhammad Sāhab, Sāī Nāth of Śhirḍī.<br>
They are all one. Are They or not?</font> You can witness it after Self-realization. If you believe in one Guru, like Nāṇak, then you have no right not to accept Muhammad Sāhab. If you get Muhammad Sāhab and not Nāṇak, then you have no authority as well.<br>
You will be surprised, most of the cancer disease comes from the imbalance of Bhavasāgar, you follow one but not the other. Cancer also comes when we don't follow Them.<br>
Like He forbade two things, like not to smoke a cigarette and not to consume alcohol.<br>
Alcohol is entirely not allowed. Here, in Sahaja Yoga, if someone is habituated to drink alcohol, they will leave it. If they don't leave alcohol, it will [not] be in moderation because both of these things go against Guru Tattwa.<br>
If Guru Tattwa is not established within us, we cannot have our evolution. Guru Tattwa is essential. Guru Tattwa is one destiny for all religions. There is one flow from all the religions."<br>

"So the dharma that has been established in us by God Almighty because if we want to go to the Kingdom of God, then in our freedom we must desire to get to God. If someone tries to pressurize us and says, 'You must ask for God,' then it is of no use, it is not an evaluation. That is why to reach in this state, a person has to seek the God as per his own independent sweet will and not due to any pressure, or any disease or any hardships or any sorrow, but only because of the fact and realizing that, 'It is the only motive of our life to seek God.'<br>
<font color="red">That is why, when we desire for this Divine Gift, then the doors of God Almighty's Divine Blessings open for you, and around the center is a place of Ten Primordial Gurus.

<font color="red"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> I have so far told you how the evolution was led by Viṣhṇu and His Incarnations on the Earth.<br>
Apart from this there was a unique Incarnation of the Primordial Master, Ādi Guru, in the Void or Bhavasāgara. He incarnated many a times to guide humanity to cross the Void.<br>
These Masters evolved new personalities endowed with the Principles of Disciples or Śhiṣhya Tattwa, who manifested as Great Disciples of this Ādi Guru. The disciples created by Ādi Guru were human beings but they achieved salvation with the help of their Gurus or their own efforts. They were not Divine Incarnations and are known as Avadhūts.<br>

"<font color="red">The Primordial Master was also born as Macchindranāth, and again as Zoroaster who was worshiped by the ancient Persians, and still revered by Parsis.</font> Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism. In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates. He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā). Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918. Altogether there were ten major Avatāras of Dattātreya."<br>

"The material energy of sound becomes absolutely divine only when a realized Soul creates it by percussion or by vocal means. For example, chanting mantras or talking to Deities by non-realized souls creates barriers for their communication with these Deities, who become very angry with such unauthorized practices. Human beings must understand that there is a protocol for approaching the Divine; ignorance of it is no excuse. For example, if a non-realized soul continues to chant the name of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, he may get throat problems, and ultimately even throat cancer. Sounds that are used for invoking Deities in temples, or in the worship of God by realized Souls or Yogis, are the sounds which carry or reflect Divine Vibrations. Mantras are divine sounds, and the poetic language of the Scriptures is based on the complete divine expression of the sound element. The Lord's Prayer and <i>Namāz</i> are pure mantras. <font color="red">The Parsi <i>Avestha</i> Scriptures (of the followers of Zoroaster) and the Sanskrit <i>śhlokas</i> of the Hindus are all divine words which carry Divine Vibrations.</font> If these words are uttered by non-realized people, they have no meaning and give no connection to God. If they are uttered by unholy people, these can fall victims to the anger of the Deities. Such individuals may fall into the subconscious or supraconscious realms. The Divine Power, the integrated energy, is expressed as the Word, also known as the Auṃ or Logos or <i>Anahalk</i>."<br>

"In Japan we had another great Master whose name was Viditama. He was the disciple of Lord Buddha and he went to Japan and started the Zen system. Zen means meditation -- dhyāna -- and he wanted people to become "thoughtlessly aware". He found out many ways of making people "thoughtlessly aware" -- the tea ceremony and the temples that they have, are all meant to create thoughtless awareness. I was amazed that none of the Japanese knew what the purpose of these gardens were. There is one garden which has some moss on top of a hill in a very small area and it is very interesting. You have to see the flowers and other foliage there through a magnifying glass. All this should amaze a person and one should become thoughtlessly aware. That was the idea of Zen, but surprisingly, few understood Zen. <font color="red">Then there was a Prophet, Zoroaster, who was born five times in His country, Persia.</font> Ultimately Muhammad Sāhib had to come to say something very clearly about religion. <font color="red">But the people who followed Muhammad Sāhib, never realized the oneness of His preaching or that of Zoroaster, and they made all the Persians run away to all the other countries and so many of them came to India.</font><br>
Muhammad Sāhib has talked about Abraham, Moses, Christ in a series as They came one after the other. He has talked about the Mother of Christ especially with great respect. In the Bible She is not given so much respect because of Paul who edited the Bible. She is just called "the woman". But Prophet Muhammad says that anyone who talks against this Holy Lady will be punished, or something to that effect. So one can see that Muhammad Sāhib never talked of an exclusive religion called "Islam" (i.e., I surrender to God Almighty). But so many followers of Islam are fighting the followers of other religions and even amongst themselves."<br>

"As the Kuṇḍalinī rises into the third part, next to the Nābhī chakra, we become absolutely righteous. This area, which we call as the Ocean of Illusion, is enlightened by Ten Principles of Mastery. The Great Masters have created these ten centers of commandments which are enlightened and we become holy. There is no need to be strict in one's behavior. We automatically become really spiritual. Like an egg becomes the bird, we are born twice. In Sanskrit a Yogi or the one who knows Brahma, meaning the All-pervading Power, is called dvija and a bird is also called dvija, meaning twice-born. There were Abraham and Moses and all the Ten Primordial Masters who have been born again and again on this Earth. <font color="red">Zoroaster has been born five times and also so many of these were born in different places in different countries to guide the people to take to religious life to establish the necessary balance for the ascent.</font>"<br>
