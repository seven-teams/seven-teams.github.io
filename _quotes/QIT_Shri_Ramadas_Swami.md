[And he was given full freedom. He was given the ego and superego. In his ego he started behaving in whatever way he liked. <font color="red">In order to control him, several Saints like Sant Jñāneśhwar, Sant Tukārām, Sant Rāmadās, Sant Eknāth, etc., by their behavior tried to show him several ways of turning his attention towards God.</font> Ṛiṣhis and Munis, through their austerities, tried to show him the way to God. The Saints wrote several books explaining to man their experiences, but all these people were unable to make others experience what they had experienced.]<br>

That in ah now Sajjanagaḍ such a Great Saint [Śhrī Swāmī Rāmadās] lived, who just wore one dress on His body. You went to see Him. You went to see His vibrations. Now, how much are you going to have out of His life in yourself? That is the point is.<br>
And God knows where He lived! Nobody knew how He lived. He used to sleep on stones and He has to ... has bath uh in every place, wherever He went, on a ... in a river or any place.<br>
He never cooked His food. He used to beg once in the day time.<br>
Such a Great Saint used to go and beg, you see? If you I'll ask you to go and begged [beg], you will feel that I am insulting you.<br>
So He used to go and beg while the whole of welcome, Śhivajī was at His Lotus Feet. But He used to beg. And He used to beg once, eat that much whatever He got from whatever house, that He would eat, and then He would not eat at all.<br>

Because you are Saints they have allowed you, but behave like Saints!<br>
What's this nonsense going on? Talking about comfort, this nonsense.<br>
What comfort do you have there? I feel most uncomfortably in the Western countries. There's no comfort of the Spirit! Most uncomfortable I feel. Everybody drinking, everybody nonsensically, so materialistic, so materialistic they are! Horrible!<br>
Now don't think too much of yourself, for Heaven's sake.<br>
I don't want you to talk that somebody's dominating you, crossing your maryādās, 'Sahaj means lethargy.' Why don't you have your own Spirits and your own this ... uh arrangements?<br>
Everything you have misleft, two room... four rooms there unlocked, this thing.<br>
There's one girl looking after Me, [snapping Her right fingers:] how smart she is! Just see how smart she is.<br>

"This needs to be found out, hence everyone has [been] told that, 'Everybody should find their own Spirit.' If one of them has told, then it should be described (varṇana).

"In India, there are many who believe in fasting, penance, etc., many of them only suffer from disease and nothing else.<br>
Jew don't believe in Christ because Christ said that, "I will suck all your sins in Me," which is true because when your Āgñyā chakra opens the sins are sucked out by Him. However, they will not believe in Christ.<br>
In addition, they believe that, 'Man should accept suffering to achieve God.' They think that, 'If a Saint is suffering then it is fine for he will get God.'<br>
We made Gyāneśhwar suffer. <font color="red">We did not follow Rāmadās Swāmī.</font> We troubled Tukārām. Similarly, in the case of Nāṇak, Kabīr Dās, [They] were troubled.<br>
To say you are a Saint, you cannot get angry. [<font color="orange">unclear</font>]. As if we are entitled to all the anger and they are supposed to accept and suffer everything."<br>

But I tell you that Maharashtra's background is very great.<br>
They forget everything and don't study or understand. Now, how much knowledge of music they have in Maharashtra. There is lot of literature of Saints in Marathi language. But who reads such books now?<br>
They purchase dirty books from the street and read. Very superficial things ... not going deeper but floating on top. This is the condition of Yuva [young] generation.<br>
If it continues then they all will be lost. They will become useless.<br>

He went in the jungles. He saw a tigress, and the ... there were little-little ... small little ch... children she had, and those cubs were lying on the side. He went and he just said: "Namaskār" to her. He said: "My Guru wants your milk." [One Sahaja Yogi laughs.]<br>
That's all. Because Gurus are Parabrahma. Their orders are listened to by the Parabrahma.<br>
"My Guru, Śhrī Rām[a]dāsa, wants your milk. So, please, will you give me your milk?" So, nicely she got up, stood up before him. He ... milked her, and took that milk for his Guru.<br>
This is what it is.<br>
Have you understood the meaning of Guru Pada?<br>
When you become absolutely one with the desires of your Guru, you achieve the position of a guru.<br>
But if you still have certain ideas about it, then Śhrī Rāmadāsa has said: that then God, "Alpa dhāriṣhṭa paye," sees your little courage, 'All right, go ahead. Break your heads and then come back. I'll fix them up.'<br>
So it is important that we should ... do one thing seriously: is to take your Mother very seriously when it comes to some request.<br>
......<br>
Is better to listen to what the Guru is telling you, and better to do it. Whatever the Guru says is all right.<br>
Gurus can ask you anything!<br>
I mean, I am quite a nice Guru. [Laughter, smiles.]<br>
Like, this Rāmadāsa Himself asked His disciples: that, "I have got a very bad, septic, uh-uh-uh big boil. And uh please uh try to suck it out because is full of pus."<br>
Imagine!<br>
So they didn't know what to do. You know, how to suck the pus of the Guru is too much.<br>
But Śhivajī came forward. He took down his hat, sat down next to him, started sucking. People said, "How is it?" "It's very sweet, she [it's] very nice."<br>
Actually He had tied a mango there. [Laughter, smiles, applause.]<br>
That is how the gurus took lot of tests-s-s.<br>
I have never taken your test, and you do not take the tests of others. Leave them to Me, I'll manage, all of them, one by one.<br>
Whatever has to happen, happens."</font><br>

Someone from them tells Me, "Śhrī Mātājī, he [false guru] has made lots of money. His wife eloped with Rajneesh. Probably she was not given money. We accepted him." OK do it.<br>
But, you say, "I accept," who is this 'I'? Humility should start from here: 'Who am I? I am a Sahaja Yogi. I am a Sahaja Yogi who has become [the] Spirit. Then how should I have behaved?'<br>
You have before you the examples of Gyāneśhwara, Tukārām, Rāmadās, Eknāth. Have you not heard or read about them?<br>
Nāmadeva whom Guru Nāṇaka held to His heart was the one who was from Maharashtra and [a] tailor by caste, wasn't he? Here in his temple they sing bhajans to the beats of cymbals and not even ten persons from the tailor caste go there -- if ten of them are there, we can say Nāmadeva's efforts have shown results.<br>
Today I request to all Saints and Sādhus to take birth in this country and improve all the people."<br>

<b>Version 2:</b>
Yesterday there was somebody who came saying that, "I am working to demolish the blind faith in people." So there is that thing, whatever anybody comes up with, people will start following him, they will follow in their thousands, to such filth.<br>
"They have made so much money," Śhrī Mātājī. "And his wife has run off with Rajneesh." "Is that so?", I said, "Maybe he did not give her any money." "We used to worship him." "Really?" Then you carry on doing so.<br>
What do you mean by saying that, "We used to worship him?" Who are you? You should ask yourself, 'Who are you?' Humility should start right from here, 'Who am I? I am a Sahaja Yogi. Who has become the Ātmā, I am a Sahaja Yogi, and how should a Sahaja Yogi behave?'<br>
You have an example of Gyāneśhwar in front of you, you have an example of Tukārām in front of you, Rāmadās and Ekanātha's example is in front of you, did you not hear what They had to say? Have you not witnessed that?<br>
Nāmadeva, who Śhrī Guru Nāṇaka embraced, wasn't that Nāmadeva also a tailor from this Maharashtra? But what I see here, that they are busy singing in his temple! Even if there will be just ten tailors come to Sahaja Yoga, then we should think that Nāmadevas existence has been worth it.<br>
Today I just want to pray to all those Saints that, 'Please take Your birth here again in Maharashtra and put these people right.' "</font><br>
