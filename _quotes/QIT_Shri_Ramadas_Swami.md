[And he was given full freedom. He was given the ego and superego. In his ego he started behaving in whatever way he liked. <font color="DarkRed">In order to control him, several Saints like Sant Jñāneśhwar, Sant Tukārām, Sant Rāmadās, Sant Eknāth, etc., by their behavior tried to show him several ways of turning his attention towards God.</font> Ṛiṣhis and Munis, through their austerities, tried to show him the way to God. The Saints wrote several books explaining to man their experiences, but all these people were unable to make others experience what they had experienced.]<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Afterwards in sixteenth century there have been many Saints in Maharashtra like Śhrī Rāmadāsjī, who was the Guru of Śhivajī Mahārāj. Someone questioned Him, 'How Kuṇḍalinī awakens?' On this His response was, "It happens spontaneously. But there has to be a deserving receiver [disciple] and an able Granter [Guru]." "</font><br>

And tomorrow it's a New Year, is a very big day tomorrow. So we have to make some promises to ourselves.<br>
That in ah now Sajjanagaḍ such a Great Saint [Śhrī Swāmī Rāmadās] lived, who just wore one dress on His body. You went to see Him. You went to see His vibrations. Now, how much are you going to have out of His life in yourself? That is the point is.<br>
And God knows where He lived! Nobody knew how He lived. He used to sleep on stones and He has to ... has bath uh in every place, wherever He went, on a ... in a river or any place.<br>
He never cooked His food. He used to beg once in the day time.<br>
Such a Great Saint used to go and beg, you see? If you I'll ask you to go and begged [beg], you will feel that I am insulting you.<br>
So He used to go and beg while the whole of welcome, Śhivajī was at His Lotus Feet. But He used to beg. And He used to beg once, eat that much whatever He got from whatever house, that He would eat, and then He would not eat at all.<br>

You are the people who are the foundation, what are you‽ You are not Saints, are you not?<br>
How does a Saint lives [live]?<br>
<font color="DarkRed">You have seen Rāmdāsa Swāmī [in Sajjangaḍa], I went to see.</font><br>
Now do you realize that you went to Mahālakṣhmī, that's one of the ... one of the Pīṭhas of, one of the Kuṇḍalinī's Pīṭha, you see, of the whole Universe. Did you follow that?<br>
Looking after your comfort things or looking after your Spirit? What are you doing here?<br>
Did you go ... did you understand that the temple was for that? Did you follow that point?<br>
And now, I want you to see another temple. And then another temple I'm going to arrange.<br>
Is not so easy: no tourist has gone to these temples! Actually no Indians are -- no foreigners are allowed in these temples.<br>
Because you are Saints they have allowed you, but behave like Saints!<br>
What's this nonsense going on? Talking about comfort, this nonsense.<br>
What comfort do you have there? I feel most uncomfortably in the Western countries. There's no comfort of the Spirit! Most uncomfortable I feel. Everybody drinking, everybody nonsensically, so materialistic, so materialistic they are! Horrible!<br>
Now don't think too much of yourself, for Heaven's sake.<br>
I don't want you to talk that somebody's dominating you, crossing your maryādās, `Sahaj means lethargy.' Why don't you have your own Spirits and your own this ... uh arrangements?<br>
Everything you have misleft, two room... four rooms there unlocked, this thing.<br>
There's one girl looking after Me, [snapping Her right fingers:] how smart she is! Just see how smart she is.<br>
Even ten En... English girls can't look after Me the way she looks after Me. Every little bit of that she knows!<br>

"This needs to be found out, hence everyone has [been] told that, 'Everybody should find their own Spirit.' If one of them has told, then it should be described (varṇana). But whoever has become great, they have told us that, 'You need to find your own Spirit within. You should find your God within yourself.' <font color="DarkRed">This has been told by all Seers and Saints: Rāmadās has told this, before Him Mārkaṇḍeya has told this, Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya has told this, Christ has told this, Muhammad has told this, Buddha has told this, Mahāvīra has told this, everyone has told this, that, 'We need to find the Spirit within ourselves.'</font> "<br>

"In India, there are many who believe in fasting, penance, etc., many of them only suffer from disease and nothing else.<br>
Jew don't believe in Christ because Christ said that, "I will suck all your sins in Me," which is true because when your Āgñyā chakra opens the sins are sucked out by Him. However, they will not believe in Christ.<br>
In addition, they believe that, 'Man should accept suffering to achieve God.' They think that, 'If a Saint is suffering then it is fine for he will get God.'<br>
We made Gyāneśhwar suffer. <font color="DarkRed">We did not follow Rāmadās Swāmī.</font> We troubled Tukārām. Similarly, in the case of Nāṇak, Kabīr Dās, [They] were troubled.<br>
To say you are a Saint, you cannot get angry. [<font color="orange">unclear</font>]. As if we are entitled to all the anger and they are supposed to accept and suffer everything."<br>

"<font color="DarkRed">Only Swāmī Rāmadāsa did not do Prapañcha. But in [His Marathi book] Dāsbodha, Prapañcha is flowing in every page. "Leaving Prapañcha, you cannot find God." He said this many times.</font><br>

But I tell you that Maharashtra's background is very great.<br>
They forget everything and don't study or understand. Now, how much knowledge of music they have in Maharashtra. There is lot of literature of Saints in Marathi language. But who reads such books now?<br>
They purchase dirty books from the street and read. Very superficial things ... not going deeper but floating on top. This is the condition of Yuva [young] generation.<br>
If it continues then they all will be lost. They will become useless.<br>
Ask Me! I went to America and there are sixty-five percent jobless people. There they are afraid of a disease called AIDS. All young generation is dying and can't understand how to escape from it.<br>
Its reason is, 'What's wrong?' <font color="DarkRed">'There might have been Saint Rāmadāsa, what are we going to do with Him? Keep this all with you, we are becoming modern now.'</font><br>
This stupid modernity! Where those modern Americans are going? You go to those countries once, what is the condition of those modern people?<br>
The writers here keep writing about those countries sitting here. Go there and see what's happening in those modern countries!<br>
