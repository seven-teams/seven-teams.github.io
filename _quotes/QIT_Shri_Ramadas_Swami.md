[And he was given full freedom. He was given the ego and superego. In his ego he started behaving in whatever way he liked. <font color="red">In order to control him, several Saints like Sant Jñāneśhwar, Sant Tukārām, Sant Rāmadās, Sant Eknāth, etc., by their behavior tried to show him several ways of turning his attention towards God.</font> Ṛiṣhis and Munis, through their austerities, tried to show him the way to God. The Saints wrote several books explaining to man their experiences, but all these people were unable to make others experience what they had experienced.]<br>

That in ah now Sajjanagaḍ such a Great Saint [Śhrī Swāmī Rāmadās] lived, who just wore one dress on His body. You went to see Him. You went to see His vibrations. Now, how much are you going to have out of His life in yourself? That is the point is.<br>
And God knows where He lived! Nobody knew how He lived. He used to sleep on stones and He has to ... has bath uh in every place, wherever He went, on a ... in a river or any place.<br>
He never cooked His food. He used to beg once in the day time.<br>
Such a Great Saint used to go and beg, you see? If you I'll ask you to go and begged [beg], you will feel that I am insulting you.<br>
So He used to go and beg while the whole of welcome, Śhivajī was at His Lotus Feet. But He used to beg. And He used to beg once, eat that much whatever He got from whatever house, that He would eat, and then He would not eat at all.<br>

Did you go ... did you understand that the temple was for that? Did you follow that point?<br>

Is not so easy: no tourist has gone to these temples! Actually no Indians are &#8211; no foreigners are allowed in these temples.<br>
Because you are Saints they have allowed you, but behave like Saints!<br>
What's this nonsense going on? Talking about comfort, this nonsense.<br>
What comfort do you have there? I feel most uncomfortably in the Western countries. There's no comfort of the Spirit! Most uncomfortable I feel. Everybody drinking, everybody nonsensically, so materialistic, so materialistic they are! Horrible!<br>
Now don't think too much of yourself, for Heaven's sake.<br>
I don't want you to talk that somebody's dominating you, crossing your maryādās, 'Sahaj means lethargy.' Why don't you have your own Spirits and your own this ... uh arrangements?<br>
Everything you have misleft, two room... four rooms there unlocked, this thing.<br>
There's one girl looking after Me, [snapping Her right fingers:] how smart she is! Just see how smart she is.<br>

"This needs to be found out, hence everyone has [been] told that, 'Everybody should find their own Spirit.' If one of them has told, then it should be described (varṇana).

You should find your God within yourself.' <font color="red">This has been told by all Seers and Saints: Rāmadās has told this, before Him Mārkaṇḍeya has told this, Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya has told this, Christ has told this, Muhammad has told this, Buddha has told this, Mahāvīra has told this, everyone has told this, that, 'We need to find the Spirit within ourselves.'</font> "<br>

"In India, there are many who believe in fasting, penance, etc., many of them only suffer from disease and nothing else.<br>
Jew don't believe in Christ because Christ said that, "I will suck all your sins in Me," which is true because when your Āgñyā chakra opens the sins are sucked out by Him. However, they will not believe in Christ.<br>
In addition, they believe that, 'Man should accept suffering to achieve God.' They think that, 'If a Saint is suffering then it is fine for he will get God.'<br>
We made Gyāneśhwar suffer. <font color="red">We did not follow Rāmadās Swāmī.</font> We troubled Tukārām. Similarly, in the case of Nāṇak, Kabīr Dās, [They] were troubled.<br>
To say you are a Saint, you cannot get angry. [<font color="orange">unclear</font>]. As if we are entitled to all the anger and they are supposed to accept and suffer everything."<br>

But I tell you that Maharashtra's background is very great.<br>
They forget everything and don't study or understand. Now, how much knowledge of music they have in Maharashtra. There is lot of literature of Saints in Marathi language. But who reads such books now?<br>
They purchase dirty books from the street and read. Very superficial things ... not going deeper but floating on top. This is the condition of Yuva [young] generation.<br>
If it continues then they all will be lost. They will become useless.<br>
Ask Me! I went to America and there are sixty-five percent jobless people. There they are afraid of a disease called AIDS. All young generation is dying and can't understand how to escape from it.<br>

The writers here keep writing about those countries sitting here. Go there and see what's happening in those modern countries!<br>
