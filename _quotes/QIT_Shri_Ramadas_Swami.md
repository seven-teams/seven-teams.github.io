[And he was given full freedom. He was given the ego and superego. In his ego he started behaving in whatever way he liked. <font color="red">In order to control him, several Saints like Sant Jñāneśhwar, Sant Tukārām, Sant Rāmadās, Sant Eknāth, etc., by their behavior tried to show him several ways of turning his attention towards God.</font> Ṛiṣhis and Munis, through their austerities, tried to show him the way to God. The Saints wrote several books explaining to man their experiences, but all these people were unable to make others experience what they had experienced.]<br>

<font color="red">"And the this is the statue of a ... here if you see on the right-hand side is uh Śhrī Rām[a]dās Swāmī, the one who was the Guru of a ... our great ... great king Śhivajī Mahārāj, you see.<br>
......<br>
He worshiped from His childhood, you see, and because Hanumāna is uhs ... is a ... an angel, you know that, and He doesn't marry. But He was forced to marry, you see. So. when He was getting married only, He ran away from that place. Because when they said, "Sāvadhān, sāvadhāṃ," means now after marriage they say, "All right, be careful, became ..." Just before the marriage took place, He just ran way from there, without getting married. Because He cannot be married. He told them, they would not listen and He couldn't bear it [laughing:] any more, so ran away.<br>
Then He went and He ... came back again when ... uh-uh-uh ... in the time of Śhivajī. And the then Śhivajī became His disciple.<br>
But uh He ... He took some tes[ts] of His disciples.<br>
I do not take any tests but uh, you see, [He] took some tests.<br>
First of all, He said, "I'm very-very sick and I've got a very big uh-uh-uh ... uh-uh ... wound in My foot and it has become a[n] ... uh ulcer now. It's a ... it's all full of pus and uh ... full of all ... uh-uh-uh blood and pus and all that. And only a ... a ... eh-eh-eh ... My disciple can only suck it out. Otherwise nobody can suck it out." So, all His disciples got a fright of their lives. They [as some laughter starts:] said, "How can we do that? Is too much!" But Śhivajī said, "All right." Śhivajī came and took out his a crown, and he just sat down, sucking his a ... uh-uh-uh ... his a ... wound, you see. And it was nothing but He had tied a big uh-uh-uh, now, mango. [As laughter starts:] And he was just su...<br>
But then He wen... told Śhivajī and others that uh ... uh ... they [He] said, "I'm very sick now. You must uh get Me the ... milk of the .... uh-uh-uh ... tigress," you see. You must go and get them [it]."<br>
That, those days there were lots of tigers and tigresses here, but not nowadays.<br>
So He said, "You must go and get uh milk of the tigress for Me." So they all thought, how they can go and milk the tigress? It's very difficult. [Laughter.] So-o-o ... they uh ... Śhivajī said, "All right, I'll go down."<br>
He went in the village, and then he went to the ... uh forest, you see. And there he saw a's tigress, you see. So-o-o, he went and told the tigress, he just uh bowed before the tigress, he said, "See, I don't want to disturb you, but my Guru wants your milk. So you please allow me to take your milk." And the tigress came and stood before him! And he milked the tigress, and took the milk to-o-o his Guru and gave it to Him.<br>
So the Guru ... uh so ... uh-uh-uh people asked him, "How did you manage? How could you do that?" He said, "Don't you know what our Guru is? He is the ... uh-uh-uh Hanumāns Himself. He is ... He is God [laughing:] Himself. What is there? I just went and told and tigress knew about Him. She just said, 'All right.' "Shea [if] Guru wants it, how can she trouble me?"<br>
If you have to do anything for your Guru, whatever you have to do for your Guru, with full faith and understanding about the Guru, then of course the animals understands, then why not human being?<br>
So, he said, "I can't understand why you were very afraid of it. Is nothing much."<br>
And that is what it is.<br>
But in those days, all the gurus used to take such parīkṣhās [tests].<br>
But uh-uh-uh when, ultimately, you see after his all training, uh-uh-uh ... the ... uh-uh-uh ... king who was Śhivajī, was crowned.<br>
You see, after crowning, one day, this Rām[a]dās Swāmī went to his house. And wherever He went He used to ask for some alms. Only from one house He used to get. And He used to go and just uh-uh-uh knock His a ... He had something He used to carry with Him that He used to knock. And He used to say that: "Jay jay Raghuvīr Samarth!", He used to say like that. He went and said that.<br>
So, His disciple was the king there, and he ... he understood that,  His disciple understood that, 'My Guru has come. I have to give something as a dakṣhiṇā. What can I give him?'<br>
So he wrote a letter that, "All my kingdom is ... is yours. I give everything to You, Sir. I owe nothing."<br>
And he sent that letter to Him.<br>
So, when the letter came into His a ... everywhere She [He] was asking for alms, you see. He opened it and read it, and he laughed and He called, you see, disciple. He said: "You see, I'm a ... I'm a saṃnyāsī. So you can't give Me anything. I ... I ... what will I do with the ... the  kingdom? I don't know how to run the kingdom. But you have to run the kingdom. But you must now, as you have given it to a saṃnyāsī, do it with a detached mind. The whole thing should be done with the detached mind of a saṃnyāsī. And for that you must use ... this, My" -- He used to cover Himself with a loincloth, you see, with a double type of a loincloth, which you have seen how little loincloth He was wearing. "This should be used as the flag to show that just a loincloth of a saṃnyāsī is the flag of Marāṭhās."<br>
And that's how this ... uh-uh-uh ... orange-colored flag was hoisted as the flag of Śhivajī.<br>
And now it is used politically also by some people, that's a wrong thing to do.<br>
But this is the flag, which you must have seen in My, all My, most of My processions, they use it: is the flag which was taken by ... uh this King, Śhivajī Mahārāj, as his own flag to announce that he is doing this, he is running this kingdom with the detached mind of a saṃnyāsī.<br>
So there are many stories about them, lots of stories about Rām[a]dās and ... uh-uh His disciple, this king, and how He used to tell him how to run the his administration.<br>
And ... and Śhivajī was the ideal king that we had in this country. Ideal king: a very good character, a very dhārmik fellow, and a very nice person.<br>
And they ... because he wanted four people, four kingdoms to join together, they said that, "If you marry our daughters, only we'll accept you." He had to marry four women. He married them, and looked after them very well.<br>
And he was a very good character and a very nice person and a very good king. And he is such a great uh source of inspiration to Maharashtrians.<br>
And he used to worship all these Gods and ... and Rāma specially. And ... when you will go to Tuḷajāpūr also you will see how he used to come by his horse, uh-uh-uh ... all the way, for miles together, to visit this Devī's temple.<br>
There is another temple formed by ... uh-uh the same Śhrī Rām[a]dāsa, who ... who found a statue of the Goddess. And He calls it Angla Devī.<br>
See now, angla ... angla in Sanskrit means English. Can you imagine?<br>
[After a Sahaja Yogi says something:] Is something surprising, isn't it?<br>
[After a Sahaja Yogi says something:] And He called it Angla Devī.<br>
He put that statue in a temple there. And is called as Angla Gaon [village]. Is one Angla Gaon.<br>
Angla in Sanskrit means English, you see. Angla. It's very surprising, isn't it? So I think at least the English Sahaja Yogis must go and see. [Laughter.]
Already, He must have thought of a[n] English Goddess, you see, from London.<br>
[As laughter starts:] Like a ... ah, when they do My Pūjā, sometimes they call Me Londonopuro [Londonpur] Vāsi[ni] [The One who resides in London]. [Some laughter.]<br>
......<br>
Then we had gone to see Ajiṃkyatārā ['The Impregnable Star', fort 4 kms ESE of Sātārā]. There are two. But this has more value because is the ... is the ... is just barren, nothing, but His ... uh Samādhi is there. His tomb is there.<br>
So, I think you would like to take the darśhan.<br>
[After a Sahaja Yoginī says, "Yes.":] It's a very beautiful thing to see.<br>
......<br> 
Rām[a]dās Swāmī's. Śhrī Rām[a]dās Swāmī's tomb is there.</font><br>

And God knows where He lived! Nobody knew how He lived. He used to sleep on stones and He has to ... has bath uh in every place, wherever He went, on a ... in a river or any place.<br>
He never cooked His food. He used to beg once in the day time.<br>
Such a Great Saint used to go and beg, you see?</font> If you I'll ask you to go and begged [beg], you will feel that I am insulting you.<br>
<font color="red">So He used to go and beg while the whole of welcome, Śhivajī was at His Lotus Feet. But He used to beg. And He used to beg once, eat that much whatever He got from whatever house, that He would eat, and then He would not eat at all.</font><br>

"<font color="red">Once Śhivajī was building a huge fort. And there it so happened that he got into ego. He felt, 'See, because of this work, so many people are employed.' [Then] his Guru Rāmdāsa appeared on the scene.<br>
He Himself is the controller of ego, because He was the Incarnation of Hanumāna!<br>
So He came, and He said, "All right, I want you to do one thing for me." He said, "Yes, sir, what do You want me to do?" He said: "You break this boulder that is lying here, such a big boulder, bit by bit." So it started breaking, when people hit it. And inside came a little s-stone, which he took up, just like a coconut in his hand. And he broke [it]. And there was water and there was a frog inside.<br>
And he realized, [laughing:] Śhivajī, that: 'If God has created this frog, He's also keep it ... give ... given him water. Who am I, to have this ego?' So the bliss-s came into him: 'That God has provided me with everything. Is just a red-carpet treatment for me. What have I done? Nothing. Is so beautiful!'</font><br>
How many have got this bliss-s-s? Have sympathy for them. Have compassion for them, those who do not have.<br>
But bliss comes to you through your confidence in yourself. If you have no confidence in yourself, bliss cannot be."<br>

"<font color="red">Śhivajī had a Guru called Rām[a]dāsa.<br>
In those days, gurus u-sed to take lot of test of their disciples.</font><br>
I never took your test or anything. But you are ... you are testing yourself, that's all.<br>
<font color="red">And his Guru one day said that: "Ah-ah ... I think I need the milk of a tigress-s-s. I have to drink the milk of a tigress." [Some laughter.] Half of them died. [Laughter, smiles.] And most of them didn't hear it. Śhivajī said, "All right. I'll get you."<br>
He went in the jungles. He saw a tigress, and the ... there were little-little ... small little ch... children she had, and those cubs were lying on the side. He went and he just said: "Namaskār" to her. He said: "My Guru wants your milk." [One Sahaja Yogi laughs.]<br>
That's all. Because Gurus are Parabrahma. Their orders are listened to by the Parabrahma.<br>
"My Guru, Śhrī Rām[a]dāsa, wants your milk. So, please, will you give me your milk?" So, nicely she got up, stood up before him. He ... milked her, and took that milk for his Guru.</font><br>

Have you understood the meaning of Guru Pada?<br>
When you become absolutely one with the desires of your Guru, you achieve the position of a guru.<br>
<font color="red">But if you still have certain ideas about it, then Śhrī Rāmadāsa has said: that then God, "Alpa dhāriṣhṭa paye," sees your little courage, 'All right, go ahead. Break your heads and then come back. I'll fix them up.'</font><br>
So it is important that we should ... do one thing seriously: is to take your Mother very seriously when it comes to some request.<br>
......<br>
Is better to listen to what the Guru is telling you, and better to do it. Whatever the Guru says is all right.<br>
Gurus can ask you anything!<br>
I mean, I am quite a nice Guru. [Laughter, smiles.]<br>
<font color="red">Like, this Rāmadāsa Himself asked His disciples: that, "I have got a very bad, septic, uh-uh-uh big boil. And uh please uh try to suck it out because is full of pus."</font><br>
Imagine!<br>
<font color="red">So they didn't know what to do. You know, how to suck the pus of the Guru is too much.<br>
But Śhivajī came forward. He took down his hat, sat down next to him, started sucking. People said, "How is it?" "It's very sweet, she [it's] very nice."<br>
Actually He had tied a mango there. [Laughter, smiles, applause.]</font><br>
That is how the gurus took lot of tests-s-s.<br>
I have never taken your test, and you do not take the tests of others. Leave them to Me, I'll manage, all of them, one by one.<br>

"<font color="red">We have come to a place which we call as Brahmapuri here, called, perhaps, maybe because here Śhrī Rāmadāsa, the Guru of Śhivajī Mahārās [Mahārāj], in these deep waters found the statue of Śhrī Rāma, Sītā, Lakṣhmaṇa and Hanumāna together.<br>

<font color="red">Like Rāmadāsa when He jumped inside this he found it in the river, in the same way.</font><br>
......<br>
<font color="red">Now today, I am telling you this because Rāmadāsa was the Guru of Śhivajī. And He was the man who was very detached, He was Hanumāna Himself. And once He came to Śhivajī's place and Śhivajī was so fed up with this people and with the whole administration, and the way the things were. He had made a chit, saying that: "Mh... O, my Guru, I give You all my property, all my lands, all my kingdom, everything at Your Feet and You better look after it." And he [laughing:] put that chit in the ... uh-uh-uh we have the choḷī, you see, in the cloth sort of a thing.<br>
So He stood in the door and read it and he said, "What? [Laughing:] You've given Me everything?" He said, "I am a saṃnyāsī, and I don't know administration. But you can do everything ... uh-uh-uh the same way as you have been doing, but be detached about it. And to show that you are detached you must use a ... a ... waist under's ... under dhotī stuff we call it, in a triangular manner, it is made. You see, that thing, with the ... uh saffron color showing that you are detached and you are a saṃnyāsī."</font><br>
That's how this flag came into being.<br>
So the entry of the politics has been in this country ... uh entry into politics by uh-uh-uh sākṣhātkāri people or by Incarnation has been there.<br>
Most of the Incarnations have been kings. Like uh we have got Buddha, he was a king, Mahāvīra was a prince. Both were prince. Then we have got Rāma who was a king. Then we have got Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa who became a king.<br>
So the aiśhwarya, the king-ness, has to be there. Has to be a royal family. Has to be, Incarnation should be from a royal family. In India it is, that is the concept."<br>

<font color="red">But the one, they found a statue in the waters of Aṃgāpūr. It was Rāmadāsa who found it.<br>
And was kept there, and there was a statue of another Goddess, Āṅgalai Devī.</font><br>
Must be meaning England, I think [laughs]. [Laughing:] Goddess coming from England must be Āṅgalai Devī. Whatever it is.<br>
So, they wanted to remove those statues-s-s from there. And they said that the stentch ... statues would not move. So they had to ask for forgiveness, and with great difficulty they could remove those statues to one place called Chāphaḷ, where they are kept.<br>
Now why to? They took it to Chāphaḷ because there was one Hanumāna created. And this Hanumāna, they wanted to change the face, the architects. So they went on deep down trying to find out what is the, how far does this stone go. So it went on and on and on and on for, I don't know, thousands of feet they went down.

He was full of bhakti and had belief in Devī. <font color="red">And he believed in his Guru Śhri Rāmadās Swāmī and he used to believe at least other twenty-one such people, who were great Saints and Sādhus.</font><br>
All this showed his brightness, that when a person becomes bright, he does not kill anyone, does not lose his temper on anybody. A lot of balance comes in him, and with this balance he does such things, that when he talks with anybody, he will talk in such a manner, which will make people understand that, 'Yes,' it was their mistake, 'I should have not done this.'

"And it was absolutely f... the freedom of the guru, whom to accept whom not to accept. And everybody was tested thoroughly by the guru if-ph-phph they are capable of achieving Self-realization or not. And this test was so d... so hard, so difficult, and also to a point of cruelty, that very few could pass through that test.<br>
Is not like Sahaja Yoga, everybody is a Sahaja Yogi, it's not like that.<br>
That of course, made it a very narrow margin for people to achieve their Realization.<br>
And these guru[s] never used to leave their own seats, they call it takiya [pillow]. They would be there in their own place, all those who would like to go to him could come. If he allowed, then only they can meet him. You may go on for miles together, nothing: no obligations of the guru that he should meet you.<br>
Perhaps, they didn't feel that love and compassion for the seekers. They-ee didn't understand that the seekers are ardently seeking the Truth and they should not suffer. That may be the reason th-ss.. they were not so much concerned. All the time they [gurus] were testing their disciple.<br>
<font color="red">Even Rāmadās, who was the Guru of Śhivajī, was testing even Śhivajī ph... for so many times, though he was a born realized.</font>"<br>

<font color="red">"Once someone asked Rāmdās Swami, who was Śhivajī's Guru, "How much time is needed for Kuṇḍalinī awakening?" He replied, "Instantly," the same moment. "But there should be one to receive and there should be one to give it." "</font><br>

<b>Version 1:</b>
"Some people claim to be eradicating superstition. The incident which I told yesterday is one type. If somebody speaks something, they are set to harass him. They are not concerned even if thousands of people go to a dirty place.<br>
Someone from them tells Me, "Śhrī Mātājī, he [false guru] has made lots of money. His wife eloped with Rajneesh. Probably she was not given money. We accepted him." OK do it.<br>
But, you say, "I accept," who is this 'I'? Humility should start from here: 'Who am I? I am a Sahaja Yogi. I am a Sahaja Yogi who has become [the] Spirit. Then how should I have behaved?'<br>
<font color="red">You have before you the examples of Gyāneśhwara, Tukārām, Rāmadās, Eknāth. Have you not heard or read about them?</font><br>
Nāmadeva whom Guru Nāṇaka held to His heart was the one who was from Maharashtra and [a] tailor by caste, wasn't he? Here in his temple they sing bhajans to the beats of cymbals and not even ten persons from the tailor caste go there -- if ten of them are there, we can say Nāmadeva's efforts have shown results.<br>
Today I request to all Saints and Sādhus to take birth in this country and improve all the people."<br>
<nr>
<b>Version 2:</b>
Yesterday there was somebody who came saying that, "I am working to demolish the blind faith in people." So there is that thing, whatever anybody comes up with, people will start following him, they will follow in their thousands, to such filth.<br>
"They have made so much money," Śhrī Mātājī. "And his wife has run off with Rajneesh." "Is that so?", I said, "Maybe he did not give her any money." "We used to worship him." "Really?" Then you carry on doing so.<br>
What do you mean by saying that, "We used to worship him?" Who are you? You should ask yourself, 'Who are you?' Humility should start right from here, 'Who am I? I am a Sahaja Yogi. Who has become the Ātmā, I am a Sahaja Yogi, and how should a Sahaja Yogi behave?'<br>
<font color="red">You have an example of Gyāneśhwar in front of you, you have an example of Tukārām in front of you, Rāmadās and Ekanātha's example is in front of you, did you not hear what They had to say? Have you not witnessed that?</font><br>
Nāmadeva, who Śhrī Guru Nāṇaka embraced, wasn't that Nāmadeva also a tailor from this Maharashtra? But what I see here, that they are busy singing in his temple! Even if there will be just ten tailors come to Sahaja Yoga, then we should think that Nāmadevas existence has been worth it.<br>
Today I just want to pray to all those Saints that, 'Please take Your birth here again in Maharashtra and put these people right.' "<br>

<font color="red">"Similarly, Rāmdās Swāmī was his Guru. In the sixteenth century there was much conversation about Kuṇḍalinī and so somebody asked Him, "How long does it take for Kuṇḍalinī awakening?" He said, "Immediately.
