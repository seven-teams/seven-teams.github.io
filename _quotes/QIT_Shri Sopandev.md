<font color="DarkRed">"Even Muhammad Sāhab has described His son-in-law in many ways. And He is the only One, or there's another Incarnation, of Brahmadeva, who came on this Earth, ʿAlī, came on this Earth. He was the Incarnation of Brahmadeva and His another Incarnation was Sopāndev, which ... you can go to Poona [Pune], you can see the temple of Sopāndev there."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> Sometimes I feel, all these Incarnations have created a chaos for Me. If they had not done all this nonsense with these ignorant people, it would have been a much better world, you know.<br>
<b>Dr. Rustom Burjorjee:</b> So why did They come, Śhrī Mātājī?<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> Huh?
<b>Dr. Rustom Burjorjee:</b> Why did They come?<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> They came to bring you to make the sopān [ladder] as this, what you call a, is the step by which you have to rise.<br>
But everybody seems to be completely disobeyed.<br>

<b>Version 1 :</b>
I mean to say that the Sopānamārga, which is Suṣhumṇā Path, the central path, is the Path of Lord Viṣhṇu. Through this path we attain the Śhiva Tattwa. So Śhiva Tattwa is the destination and the Path is made by Lord Viṣhṇu.<br>
This central path is the creation of Lord Viṣhṇu and the Ādi Śhakti. Lord Śhiva has no role in it: He sits comfortably in His Seat, without bothering for anybody. If someone wishes to come, may come.<br>
To attain Śhiv Tattwa we should go through this Viṣhṇu Path and correct all the centers that are created on it. When the centers are cleansed, the Viṣhṇu Path opens up and our ascent begins.<br>
<br>
<b>Version 2 :</b>
"Meaning that the Sopānamārga which has been created, which we call as Suṣhumṇā nāḍī, which is central path, is the Path of Lord Viṣhṇu. And through this Path we attain the Śhiva Tattwa. So Śhiva Tattwa is the destination to Śhiva, and the Path is made by Lord Viṣhṇu.<br>
To create this Path, Viṣhṇujī and Ādi Śhakti have taken efforts. Lord Shiva has no role in it: He sits comfortably in His Seat, not bothering about anyone who comes or doesn't come.<br>
So, to attain this Śhiv Tattwa, we should go through this Viṣhṇu Path."<br>
