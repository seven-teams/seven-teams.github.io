<font color="red">"Now, what can I say, you would be surprised, that the Shia sect that started after Muhammad Sāhab, His daughter was Fāṭimah, She was also Ādi Śhakti.<br>
And Her two children were, Hasan and Husayn, back then, when They saw even after the annihilation of the world, the human beings did not understand, then They were born as Buddha and Mahāvīra and They brought the non-violence as religion, and attempted that, 'Maybe with the establishment of non-violence people will achieve Self-realization.' But couldn't do it."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="red">"After the birth of the daughter of Muhammad Sāhab, as I talked yesterday also, there was beginning of the caste Shia in Islam.<br>
Shia word has been derived from Siyā. The word which come from Siyā became Shia -- Siyā means Sītājī. If you go to UP [Uttar Pradesh, India] then nobody says Sītājī, they say Siyājī, 'Siyā var Rām[a]chandra ki jay.' Everyone takes the name Siyā. She was Sītājī, Ādi Śhakti Herself.<br>
And Her two sons, who were Hasan and Husayn, destroyed many evils. When They ultimately died after getting tried, then in the next birth they thought of establishment of nonviolence, violence led them nowhere.<br>
They were [re]born as Mahāvīr and Buddha to make a new experiment. Experiments do happen. "</font><br>

<p>
<font color="red">"And His daughter Fāṭimah was nobody else but Sītā Jānakī Herself.<br>
And Her two sons, Hasan and Husayn, were nobody else but Lava and Kuśha. They were born again and again: They were born as Mahāvīra and Buddha, and then They were born as Hasan and Husayn.<br>
It is only possible through Sahaja Yoga to realize that this is the Truth, this is the fact. "</font><br>

<p>
<font color="red">"Now, beyond that is God's Realization.<br>
There are three stages to that also, but just now I have told this: the Sat-chit-ānand State.<br>
The God's Realization is the state in which Gautam Buddha and Mahāvīra only rose, and They are settled down here in our brains, both of Them are here, Christ is here.<br>
And these two were not Incarnations: They were born as human beings. They were born to Sītā, as Lav and Kuśh. Then they were born as Buddha and Mahāvīra. Then Ādi Śhakti was Their mother again. Then they were born to Fāṭimah Bi as Hasan and Husayn.<br>
They are both placed here, in your head.<br>
And They are the two milestones you have got, by which you can know what a human being can rise up to that now today They are like Incarnations. Incarnations are beyond, but maybe the gap can be bri... bridged."</font><br>

<font color="red">"Now in this Void we have two great entities as well which we know as Chandra [Moon] and Sūrya [Sun]. Moon and Sun are such chakras which reside on these nāḍīs here and here.<br>
On these chakras there are two very great personalities who have been appointed. They are complete embodiment of human beings. They are like humans, in fact are humans. Out of these one is Buddha and one is Mahāvīra.<br>
But if you listen to the whole history of Their lives, then these are two sons which Śhrī Sītā had as Lav and Kuśha who is completely in human form. And after They evolved to the level that They are here as Buddha and Mahāvīra. There also they thought They have reached an extreme of nonviolence because the supports of nonviolence came in and started protecting even mosquitoes and bugs.<br>
Then They again took birth and came at the time of Muhammad. Muhammad was an Incarnation of Śhrī Janaka and His daughter Fāṭimah Bi was also Incarnation of Śhrī Sītā.<br>
Then, as Their sons as Hasan and Husayn, They gave Their life in Karbalāʾ to prove that no kind of extreme is good.<br>
And this thing is Truth or not you can see on your vibrations. If [one thinks that] I am lying, then through your vibrations you would know that not even one single word is a lie here that I am telling you. "</font><br>

<font color="red">"They are all connected. Because Hazarat ʿAlī was the son-in-law of Prophet Muhammad and Prophet Muhammad was the Incarnation of King Janaka. His sons Hasan and Husayn, who were killed in the battle of Karbalā, were no one else but Sītājī's sons Lav and Kuśh, who were later incarnated as Mahāvīr and Buddha."</font><br>

<font color="red">"Specially, these are the days of your marty[rdo]m. And I know about it, everything, what had happened to Hasan and Husayn. You all have done lot of penance for Them, and are still doing it. But now the time has come for all of you to know that Their sacrifice, Their kurbānī, has been completely fulfilled. After all, what did They want? They wanted whatever Their father, ʿAlī, wanted Them to do, also Their mother Fāṭimah. But we don't know, 'Who They were? What Incarnations They were? What was Their job?'<br>
......<br>
No need to feel guilty. You are not the ones who killed Hasan and Husayn, and still, if you feel that Hasan and Husayn should have lived, They can live through your lives. Only thing you have to know: how to become personality, make your personality of Their level. "</font><br>

<font color="red">"Later They were born in Arabia as Hasan and Husayn, the two sons of Fāṭimah, daughter of Muhammad Sāhib. They were murdered in a very violent war at Karbalāʾ. Their death signifies a great sacrifice in the name of religion. It is an indication how people who are extreme in nature take to fanaticism and, in their blindness, kill the very essence of religion that is born in flesh and blood as an Incarnation. This awakening gave a rude shock to the mass of religious human beings of the land, and there ensued a phenomenon of mass repentance. In this way people were made to realize that there can be no attachment to war for a realized Soul. Violence and nonviolence are attributes of mind but awareness is beyond these extremes. In defense of righteousness one has to go to war, but when one becomes the witness one only sees the play of war without taking any credit or discredit for it, or being disturbed by its aggression.<br>
After Fāṭimah, the Reincarnation of Sītā, died, sectarian war broke out among the Muslims. One side, the Shiya sect, was founded by Her; in Indian dialect Sītā is pronounced 'Shiya'. They are known today as Shiites. Shiya women are regarded as fair, innocent and beautiful because of their motherly expressions; in the same way the women of Janakapur, Sītā's birthplace in India, are similarly blessed by Mahālakṣhmī."</font><br>
