"Smoking, now, of course, many are saying, "Smoking causes cancer," thank God!<br>
What is tobacco meant for? Is for insecticide. It's an insecticide. I'm telling the Truth!<br>
But you use it for intoxication, or what you call, I don't know.<br>
<font color="red">Now when all the Gurus, even Moses, They told about this. All the Gurus have told! Incarnations have not but Gurus have.<br>
I mean I'll the real ones. I'm not saying these fake ones that are these days, modern days, are just making a business proposition of everything. I'm not talking about them but the real ones, who are all born in this Void, the Void described by the Zen system of religion, all the Ten Gurus. We can say the major of being the Ten Gurus are incarnated. They tell us about the dharma.</font>"<br>

"There was a doctor who was suffering from cancer, who came to Me. And he was an ardent Muslim. And I told him to take the name of Nāṇaka. He said, "I would not. I can only take the name of Muhammad." I said, "Muhammad Himself is angry with you because you are such a fanatic. Because Muhammad was born as Nāṇaka." He said, "No, I cannot take His name." "All right," I said, "go ahead." <font color="red">I said, "All right, take the name of Dattātreya." He would not take it. He would not take the name of Moses. He said, "I only know Muhammad."</font><br>
But then he was very much worse.<br>
Then he came to Me. I said, "Now take the name of Dattātreya." You won't believe: he sat down, he said, "Mother, teach me how to do Pūjā of Dattātreya." And he got much better. I must say!<br>
There was another gentleman who was a staunch Hindu. And if they are staunch, they are the worst they can take up. [Laughter.] And I told him that he has to take the name of Muhammad. And he would not! He said, "You are finishing my religion in, what are you doing‽ You are blasphemous!" And all kind of things he said. I said, "All right. You can say whatever you like."<br>
After one year he again reappeared, in Delhi. And then I told him, "Now will you take the name of Muhammad Sāhab and do some Namāz?" And he read it! And he is all right."<br>

"Now we have got Ten Dharmas within us which we have to keep all right. These are the main Ten Commandments.<br>
<font color="red">These Ten Commandments we have to look after, and these are looked after by the people who are these, the Primordial Masters, as you call Them Incarnations Divinely: like Rāja Janaka, like Moses, like Socrates, like Nāṇaka, the last one was the Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth. This is the Principle is there, is the Primordial Master.</font><br>

<font color="red">All the Gurus have said, "You should not drink." Even Moses. Every one of Them had said: "You cannot drink."</font><br>

<font color="red">For helping in it many Big Gurus have Incarnated inside us, whom you know from Socrates to Confucius, Moses, Rāja Janak, Muhammad Sāhab, Nāṇak Sāhab, Kabīr, all these Big Gurus, all of Them have worked hard on it and made dharma of human beings. It is the dharma of human beings inside, in the stomach, not outside.</font><br>

"So the dharma that has been established in us by God Almighty because if we want to go to the Kingdom of God, then in our freedom we must desire to get to God. If someone tries to pressurize us and says, 'You must ask for God,' then it is of no use, it is not an evaluation. That is why to reach in this state, a person has to seek the God as per his own independent sweet will and not due to any pressure, or any disease or any hardships or any sorrow, but only because of the fact and realizing that, 'It is the only motive of our life to seek God.'<br>
<font color="red">That is why, when we desire for this Divine Gift, then the doors of God Almighty's Divine Blessings open for you, and around the center is a place of Ten Primordial Gurus. These are the Main Gurus which are the Incarnation[s] of Śhri Dattātreya. They are: Socrates, Moses, Muhammad Sāhab, Guru Nāṇak, Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth, and Zoroaster. They are all Incarnation[s] of one Incarnation.</font>"<br>

"About Me also you can ask questions. There are many ways of recognizing because in this life, you have to recognize. You have never recognized an Incarnation so far. You have to recognize.<br>
That is compulsory and that is done through Sahajs Yoga because unless and until you are realized, how are [you] going to recognize Them also?<br>
But even if you have not recognized Them, there was no need for you to crucify Them or to torture.<br>
<font color="red">Then all the Gurus who came on this Earth, the Real Ones -- fakes are never gurus, they are not gurus -- the Real Ones that came on this Earth, say, we can say Moses, Abraham, Nāṇak, Muhammad Sāhib, Kabīr, all these are Incarnations of Primordial Master whom we call as Dattātreya.</font><br>
If They are or not, if Muhammad Sāhib and Guru Nāṇak are the same personality, same people who came in different times, then what justice are we doing to Them? How are we to find out? How are you to believe Me about it?"<br>

"This is the only way to attain in Sahaja Yoga. What can I do with this? Just like an electrical outlet is always on, a plug is inserted into it, right now, I am on. When Kṛiṣhṇa was here, people said, "We believe in Rām." <font color="red">When Kṛiṣhṇa left, Īsā Masīh came, then people said, "We believe in Moses."</font> When I have come, then people say that, "We believe in all of Them. We do not believe in You." And I am all of Them. What can be done about it? If I am that, what can be done? I do not understand why that should bother you. You all are experts in many things that I cannot do. I do not know quite a lot of things. Why should it trouble you if I know only this? I do not understand it. If I am something then I am that. Why should it bother you? If thousands of Kuṇḍalinīs are awakened, then there must be something to it, otherwise how can I be awakening the Kuṇḍalinī? Something to think about."<br>

"So, if you think evolution is a religion, then I would say Sahaja Yoga is the religion. If your evolution if you call it as a religion, then Sahaja Yoga is a religion. But is a religion which takes you belo ... beyond your sustenance, beyond your religion, dharmātīt, beyond the dharma.<br>
We have amongst ourselves Hindu[s], Muslims, Christians, all kinds of people, you know that. All these people can feel it within themselves: is the religion in their stomachs, they can feel it. They can find out where is the religion. Because, I say, there, religion in the stomach is looked after by the Deities of Primordial Master whom we call as Dattātreya, in the Sanskrit language.<br>
But does't mean Hinduism. It doesn't mean Hinduism at all. But it is called as Dattātreya in the Sanskrit language, in English is Primordial Master.<br>
<font color="red">He is the same who incarnated on this earth: as Moses, as Abraham, aand, say, incarnated as Muhammad Sāhab, as Rāja Janaka, as Nāṇaka, and also as Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth.</font> Can you believe that Muhammad Sāhab is the same as our Nāṇak?"<br>

"<font color="red">And when it is worked out with effort, many Gurus and many -- Real Ones, I'm saying, not, I'm not talking of the horrid ones -- but the Real Ones who have been working in the forest, and the great people like Moses, and Abraham and all these people, They knew how difficult it was to raise the Kuṇḍalinī, this coiled thing: gradually, one after another.</font><br>
And the detailed description of this is so horrifying that people get a fright.<br>
Actually when the Kuṇḍalinī rises, normally, by effort of people who are authorized to do it, is such a slow movement that at any center where there is any escape, any weakness, the attention immediately goes on the sides from the cause, from the center. Once it moves to the center, you start getting all kinds of visions."<br>

"But still, as you can see in the life of Christ, that coming of Christ was declared much before Christ came in by the Prophets who made prophecies. All these Prophets belong to the category of the Gurus I am talking about.<br>
So, all over the world three types of movements were on. For example, the scientist[s] on the right-hand side, we can say, and the left-hand side are the devotees of God who sing the praise of God. <font color="red">And in the center there were people like Moses, like Abraham, who came on this earth just to prophesize, just to protect the devotees of God.</font><br>
Now this middle movement of evolution, today, has reached its peak. Because all the Incarnations have arrived now, and have done Their job within you. They have occupied Their position within you, in your awareness, on these different centers. <br>
......<br>
So today we are here to know that within us all these Incarnations exist, and the force that really brought forth, really manifested, who live like human beings and work like Gurus, that force which existed in this area, which created religion within us.<br>
Religion, as we understand, organized religion, is not the religion. But the religion means: your sustaining power. You are a human being because there are ten sustaining powers within you.<br>
So, They came to sustain us and to give us full idea about these Ten Powers and to establish us in our religion as a human being.<br>
So these Gurus, who lived in that area, worked out the sustainace [sustenance] and helped us.<br>
And this is one of the greatest forces we have got, which resides within us.<br>
And whatever They have said has a very great meaning.<br>
Actually, we should say the Main Gurus are ten, but there are many other Gurus.<br>
<font color="red">And these Ten Gurus could be described as Rāja Janaka, then Moses, Abraham, and the in modern times you can say Muhammad Sāhab, and even up to Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth, in Śhirḍī, that force came in, for a short time, and then He disappeared. Nobody knows how He came there, He lived there and He died.</font> Also, if you know Nāṇaka, He was also the same force, the same Primordial Master, who was born on this Earth.<br>
Now, this is not the time to tell about individual people. But, I think, one day I will talk to you only on this subject of the Gurus.<br>
So, these Gurus first started under the Primordial Master Himself, He was called as Dattātreya."<br>

"The thing that really gives you the balance is the sustainance [sustenance], is the sustainance [sustenance], dharma. If you do not have that, then you could go, shoot off like a pendulum from this side to that.<br>
But in dharma also there could be a problem, and that is one of the worst possible, is of fanaticism. So, I mean, if you try to make the dharma a fanatic idea.<br>
<font color="red">Like none of these Incarnations, like Muhammad Sāhab who was a[n] Incarnation of the Primordial Master, and all others like Him, Moses, Abraham, any One of Them who came on this Earth, ever thought of fanaticism. Never they realized, that when they told, 'Don't do this,' 'Don't do that,' some sort of people will take up upon themselves that, 'We are the chosen ones. We are the great.' I mean, this They could never understood. And whenever They found it was happening again They took birth. Again They took birth to tell people: 'This is not dharma.'</font><br>
To form any kind of a cult or an organization and religion is against God! Is blasphemous!<br>
How can you organize God? You cannot."<br>

"Now when They said, "Don't drink," you say, 'Oh-oh, that's out-of-dated. You see, there's Muhammad Sāhab, was no good. He told us not to drink.' Nāṇaka said, "Don't drink."<br>
Now, smoking, you see the results of smoking, now what's happening with smoking. It goes against uh uh your Viśhuddhi. Because, you see, that is the place of Kṛiṣhṇa, and smoking started much later. You see, when He was much earlier, smoking started later on.<br>
That's why Nāṇak Sāhab has talked about it much more.<br>
But uh Muhammad Sāhab did see this point, He did see. So He said, "All ... all the inter... intoxicants and all habits are to be discarded. All such things must be discarded." So, He also wanted mhh yeah ...<br>
...... [Conversation to identify the English word addiction.]<br>
All these addictions must be given up. He said it, very clearly: "No addictions are allowed," according to Him.<br>
But you see, how you make uh-uh-uh uh-uh fuss about things.<br>
Like Muhammad Sāhab and all these Gurus, all these Great Incarnations of the Primordial Master who was Ādi Dattātreya, Ādinātha [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], They taught you how to maintain your religion, your sustainance [sustenance], your balance.<br>
So, immediately the Christians. <font color="red">Because Christ didn't talk much about it because Moses had talked about it, Abraham had talked about it.</font> So Christ did not talk, so they said, "All right. So Christians can drink." Just imagine.<br>
This is a loophole.<br>
That's how they became Christians perhaps. Because they thought that if ... uh they were belonged to the Jews, you see, then they would have ... uh they wouldn't be able to drink.<br>
But Jews drink like Hell. Jews also drink now! I mean the Muslims drink the most, you see.<br>
And worst are the Sikhs: who are prohibited from drinking and smoking, they can beat all your scotch people here, you see. All your scotch whiskey goes into their stomachs [laughter], all these things, and they grow in this, this  beard, thinking that they are great Sikhs going around, you see."<br>

"Around that, is that area where actually it exists in the stomach of God, we can say, this is the Bhavasāgara. This is what we have to cross. You see there's a Void, from there to there is a Void, and this we have to cross. And this is the thing which is crossed by the Kuṇḍalinī awakening.<br>
<font color="red">Now what happens? That around that uh ... that ... water-like thing that you see there, see that is the one where Ten ... the Primordial Masters were born, Gurus, Primordial Gurus. Now They were incarnated of innocence of all this three aspects. And They were incarnated on this Earth, say, from Abraham, Moses, then we had uh-uh-uh ... up to Muhammad Sāhab we can say, then we can say Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth, then Nāṇaka, Janaka, all these people incarnated as Gurus.</font><br>

And this sustenance is maintained by the Gurus in that area. And They look after us: They are born again and again, again and again, to tell us about it.<br>

Now there is a reason, which you cannot stop it. If I tell you, 'Don't drink,' you come and drink.<br>
I'll give you [a] very good reason for that, absolutely scientific, absolutely scientific. But you won't stop. So what should I do?<br>
You see, which is the other way is: 'Why do you drink?' First of all I should find out the reason for it.<br>

"All this has to be integrated. All the great religions which have been propounded in the growth of human beings, which have substantially helped in the growth of human beings, which are the substratum of their living, has to be integrated in that happening.<br>
For example, I meet, supposing, a Hindu, then he says, "Mother, how do You talk of Christ? We don't believe in Christ." Now you are a very, very great person not to believe in Christ. Who are you not to believe in Christ? What do you think of yourself? What do you mean by saying that you don't believe in Christ?

Only by going to churches or going, going to these mosques or going to these synagogues! They are blind, making you blind. What have you achieved but nothing but stark fanaticism? It's a disease! It's sickness!<br>

"What it is remarkable to see, that before this, no Incarnation said publicly, that, They were Incarnations.<br>
Rāma, of course, had forgotten that He was an incarnation. In a way, He was ... He made Himself to forget, played His māyā upon Himself, to become a complete human be-ing, Maryādā Puruṣhottama.<br>
And Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa also only told one person, Arjuna, just before he was to start the war.<br>
Abraham never said that He was the Incarnation, though He was the Incarnation of Primordial Master.<br>
Dattātreya Himself never said that He was the Incarnation of the Primordial Master. With all these three forces, acting through innocence, [He] came on this Earth to guide.<br>

"But there is a group of people, still, who have been realized, and who are not, yet, there. Now what is the difference between the two is? In very simple: is the recognition. Those who have not recognized Me, will not be blessed. They'll be going round and round and round. So, it is necessary to recognize.<br>
Now there are some people, like, we ... I'll say, very good example is, Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth's disciples are there. Now He is no more. So they believe in Him. Now where is He?<br>
They don't want to believe in the present Incarnation! They want to believe in something that is dead. They believe in Rāma. They'll believe in Christ. Most of the Christians have this problem.<br>

He ... ah ... I told ... I asked him ... uh-uh-uh what religion was he following, he said he was a ... uh-uh-uh Muslim, and out and out Muslim. I said, "What does that mean?", so he said, "It means only Muhammad was the only last Prophet, that cannot be any other Prophet." I said, "How do you know? But how are you so cocksure about it? How can you [laughing:] claim that He was the last Prophet?"<br>
Moreover his cancer was due to that kind of a fanaticism within his stomach. I told him: "You have to believe in other Prophets also." <br>
We had a Prophet in India called Guru Nāṇak, who was the Incarnation of the same. <font color="red">Abraham, Moses, all of Them were the Incarnation of the same Principle.</font><br>
But he would not accept it. I said, "I can't cure your cancer." <br>
So he went back.<br>
But when it comes to life, you understand.<br>
And he came back to Me. He said, "All right, I'll accept, and I'll take the name of Guru Nāṇak." I told him, "Muhammad Sāhāb Himself is angry with you for behaving like this. Because He was not a fanatic like you!" And when he did that, he got all right."<br>

"Apart from that, there is [a] third type of Incarnations which worked [pointing to the Void on the Chakra Chart:] in this gap: to sustain us. These are Ten Pri... Primordial Masters, the Ādi Guru. These people incarnated on this Earth to give us our sustainance [sustenance], our religion as they call it. They gave us those Ten Religions or sustainance [sustenance] which is important for a human being.<br>

"This is the Holy Ghost about which Christ could not talk to those mad people who really crucified Him.<br>
They were mad that they thought that, 'Christ was blasphemous.' Just think of it! And today we have churches and people, and this and that.<br>
When He lived nobody accepted Him, nobody recognized Him. <font color="red">When He came, they talked of Moses, Abraham.</font><br>
<font color="red">It is very nice to handle Christ, 'Better talk about Them, so that we don't have to face reality.'</font> Because if they had recognized Christ, then Christ would have said, 'All right, if you are recognizing Me, then get your Realization and understand your Self.'<br>
They where not prepared for this.<br>
Only twelve people somehow, you see, managed to be there, somehow. They would not accept Him either. Till He was resurrected, then they accepted Him, in a way.<br>

It is called as Nābhī chakra, and around it is called as the Bhavasāgara, you can say the Void, or you can say the Gap, or whatever you may say, the whole world as such, within us. So, the people who were born on this center, around this center, were born out of water element.<br>
<font color="red">In this Bhavasāgara -- oc... Bhavasāgara means the ocean of this world -- were born, through this ocean of the world, were born all the Primordial Masters, one after another. We can say Abraham, Moses, we had Janaka, were Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], and Socrates, and so many others like that, Nāṇaka, and also very recently, we had about hundred years back, a very great Saint born in India known as Sāī Nāth.<br>
They all represent the same element that is the water element. Being responsible or being born out of that, They are anxious to maintain water element as the one which is within us for sustaining ourselves. We su... we are sustained by water, so They help us to sustain ourselves. They are the sustainers: They tell us how to sustain us as a human being.<br>
And all of Them have tried to establish religion within us.</font><br>
A religion doesn't mean outside, but the religion as a man: means the capacity of a man, or you can say the quality of a man. What a human being should be like, what is the way to know if he is a human being or not, which is described in al... in the Ten Commandments."<br>

Like on a tree there's only one flower or two flowers in the beginning.<br>
<font color="red">Now, in the sixth century -- actually Christ talked about it quite a lot. And the other people, like Moses, and all these people have talked about it.

"They have described that, 'Through the ascent of the Kuṇḍalinī only you can reach your Spirit.' All the Upaniṣhadas, which are the second part of the Vedas, all of them have described the Kuṇḍalinī.

And that's how, I have seen, people, say, in Japan, they follow one religion, and in uh-uh-uh China they follow another religion, both are just the same: one is Zen, another is Tao.

"The Primordial Master was also born as Macchindranāth, and again as Zoroaster who was worshiped by the ancient Persians, and still revered by Parsis. <font color="red">Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism.</font> In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates. He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā). Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918. Altogether there were ten major Avatāras of Dattātreya."<br>

"According to the Bible, Sharia is written in the chapter of Jeremiah. <font color="red">These laws were given by Moses to the Jews, whom He found to be in a very decadent state when He came back with His Ten Commandments. So He thought these people required a very strict kind of conduct by which they could reach a certain moral discipline and cleanliness. Otherwise such immoral people could not attain spirituality.</font> Sharia was not accepted by the Jews but was taken up by Muhammad Sāhib later on because He found the Jews were not able to accept it, but He thought He would put it down for people who wanted to follow Islam, meaning surrender to the Divine. I feel it is a misinterpretation. Muhammad Sāhib could not have done it. He was Himself preaching about Rahmat (compassion) all His life. How could He talk about such strict rules for women?<br>
Perhaps He found the people of other religions were even worse than the decadent Jews.<br>
......<br>
Actually Hazarat Muhammad never made Islam an exclusive religion in the Qur'ān. <font color="red">He very respectfully talked about Moses, Abraham, Christ and His Mother, one after another.</font> Even so Muslims believe they are exclusive. Jews and Christians also believe theirs are exclusive religions. There is another problem -- they believe that Muhammad was the exclusive messenger of God and Christians believe that Christ is the last word, while Jews believe that their Savior has yet to come. If these Incarnations were the last ones why did Muhammad say, "I will send you the Twelfth Mahdī?" Also why did Christ say that He would send the Holy Ghost? We cannot say how long the Jews are going to wait for their Savior to come. They are wailing and crying before the wailing wall wearing the Torah in small amulets, but actually the most important thing for them is to collect the money that they have lent and buy diamonds at any cost."<br>

"For example, the war in Bosnia is the misidentification of Croats, Muslims and Serbs. They follow the Christian and Muslim religions. The Croats are Catholic Christians but do they follow Christ? What about Muslims who believe in the Formless God and despite this fight for land? Actually, Muhammad never talked of an exclusive religion. <font color="red">He talked about Abraham, Moses and Christ in a series and the fourth was Himself. Even Christ talked about Abraham and Moses. Why do people who follow Moses, Christ or Muhammad fight? They have the same roots. At least these three religions should produce people who understand the oneness of their religions.</font> Of course, the Hindu religion is not exclusive.

"In Japan we had another great Master whose name was Viditama. He was the disciple of Lord Buddha and he went to Japan and started the Zen system. Zen means meditation -- dhyāna -- and he wanted people to become "thoughtlessly aware". He found out many ways of making people "thoughtlessly aware" -- the tea ceremony and the temples that they have, are all meant to create thoughtless awareness. I was amazed that none of the Japanese knew what the purpose of these gardens were. There is one garden which has some moss on top of a hill in a very small area and it is very interesting. You have to see the flowers and other foliage there through a magnifying glass. All this should amaze a person and one should become thoughtlessly aware. That was the idea of Zen, but surprisingly, few understood Zen. Then there was a Prophet, Zoroaster, who was born five times in His country, Persia. Ultimately Muhammad Sāhib had to come to say something very clearly about religion. But the people who followed Muhammad Sāhib, never realized the oneness of His preaching or that of Zoroaster, and they made all the Persians run away to all the other countries and so many of them came to India.<br>
<font color="red">Muhammad Sāhib has talked about Abraham, Moses, Christ in a series as They came one after the other.</font> He has talked about the Mother of Christ especially with great respect. In the Bible She is not given so much respect because of Paul who edited the Bible. She is just called "the woman". But Prophet Muhammad says that anyone who talks against this Holy Lady will be punished, or something to that effect. So one can see that Muhammad Sāhib never talked of an exclusive religion called "Islam" (i.e., I surrender to God Almighty). But so many followers of Islam are fighting the followers of other religions and even amongst themselves."<br>
