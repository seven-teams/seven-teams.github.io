"References to Kuṇḍalinī awakening abound in many of the Indian Scriptures. Some of these are Vāsiṣhṭha Yoga, Ṛigveda, Puruṣha Sūkta, Upaniṣhads of Atharvaveda, Yogopanishad, Yogaśhikhā Upaniṣhad, Kaṭhopaniṣhad and Yoga Kuṇḍalinī Upaniṣhad. In the Purāṇas are Devī Bhāgavat[am] Purāṇa, Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa, Śhrī Bhāgavat[a] Purāṇa, etc. In Sanhitas: Haṭh[a] Yoga Sanhita, Laya Yoga Sanhita, Rāj Yoga Sanhita, Śhiv Sanhita. <font color="red">In the Yoga tests: Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā, Saundaryalaharī, Śhubhodayam, Lalitā Sahasrānam, and by Saints such as Bhakt Kabīr, Nāṇak, Gyāneśhwar, etc.</font>"<br>

"She is the Mother. If you can think of: She is the Mother of all the Mothers.<br>
How a mother sees her child, She sees Her Creation.<br>
First, She creates through the Divine Power, acting on the Material Power, all the Creation.<br>
And then, She comes again and again, again and again, in three different forms.<br>
She comes as a Mother Herself. Then She is most powerful and expressive.<br>
As She has come, you know, as Nava Durgā She has come, as Mother Mary She has come, as Quan Yin She has come. She has come in many forms in many parts of the world. <font color="red">She came as Muhammad's daughter, She came as Nāṇaka's sister, She came as Janaka's daughter. Only one person, all the time, coming in this world in different forms.</font>"<br>

"To make the people cross the Void (Bhavasāgara) He has to make some arrangement. So the Great Power like Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, Maheśha was created and They were placed in the Area of Dharma.<br>
<font color="red">Dattātreya and Ādi Gurus incarnated in this world many a times. He incarnated as King Janaka who was like the father of Ādi Śhakti. After that He incarnated in Iran as Zoroaster, then as Macchindranāth, then as Muhammad Sāheb and Nāṇak Sāheb.</font><br>
No one fought with each other. See what type of darkness you are in?<br>
Fāṭimah, the daughter of Muhammad Sāheb was the same who became daughter of King Janaka.<br>
Whom are you fighting? Think over it.<br>
<font color="red">The Nāṇakī of Guru Nāṇaka was none else but Jānakī.</font><br>
Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth was also an Ādi Guru.<br>
<font color="red">They are the Masters of all.<br>
Also, They are My Gurus. These Ādi Gurus taught Me all this Knowledge. In different Incarnations They kept Me teaching.<br> 
Ultimately I had to come and do His work. They could not do it and now They are placing Me as a Guru so that I take up the job of a Guru.<br>
There was an age when no one was willing to accept a woman as a Guru but in Kali Yuga only Mother could do His work: it is beyond the power of men.</font><br>
This work could not be done by force, only the love of a Mother could do it because already there is so much pressure, tension in this world. The day it is forced upon the human being they will break down. So, love is the only way out.<br>
So this Gurudom was given to Me. Everything is acceptable to Me.<br>
But I didn't know the qualities of a Guru.<br>
Gurus maintain distance but mother does not keep distance with the children. Children sit on her head.<br>
So, you people also could take liberty with Me and enjoy. Be with Me with full freedom, you will neither be afraid nor be embarrassed. There is no problem, you could come and talk to Me boldly about your problems. You could complain to Me as you do to your mother. I am freely available to you.<br>
Freedom was needed, religion was required to be discussed openly, there is no secret, no secret about it. Ultimately everything has to be explained very clearly. All the secrets are to be told about, everything could not be said everywhere."<br>
......<br>
Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa had only one Son who was Praṇava incarnate. Think of it, He was Auṃ incarnate. He incarnated on this Earth. His name was Jesus Christ. Mary was His Mother. He was placed on the Āgñyā chakra.<br>
On Āgñyā one has to face ego and superego. You see your Āgñyā chakra controls your pineal (śhaṅku granthi) and pituitary body (pīyūṣh granthi), it is scientifically proved.<br>
So He pushes away the evil spirits from your Āgñyā because these spirits sit on superego. They could sit in ego also because Iḍā and Piṅgalā cross each other on Āgñyā chakra.<br>
So Lord Jesus put His hand on this plexus first of all.<br>
<font color="red">It was done at the time of Nāṇak Sāheb.</font><br>
In all ages these ghostly powers came to do encroachment. But Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa has such a destructive power that He cut their throats.<br>
So on Āgñyā chakra is the name of Lord Jesus."<br>

"But before reaching the Heart chakra, the gap I showed you, is all the Bhavasāgara. In the center is the seat of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, and on it Śhrī Brahmadeva creates the whole universe. He made this Bhavasāgara.<br>
After creating the Bhavasāgara, the question was, 'How to cross it over? The human being was created, but how to make him realize it? How to make human beings recognize it? In him, how to activate the Brahma Tattwa?' Meaning, 'How to get the Union of Śhiva and Śhakti within him? How would the connection be established?'<br>
For this, a special personality was created in this world. This was created by the combined essence of Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, and Maheśh, who we acknowledge as Śhrī Dattātreya. Śhrī Dattātreya is none other than Ādi Guru.<br>
He is My Guru. He has mentored Me all His past lives.<br>
If you hear about His birth and all His previous lives you would be amazed. We have forgotten such a great thing.<br>
Śhrī Dattātreya's Incarnations are numerous. Firstly He came as King Janaka. Śhrī Sītājī was His daughter, who was the embodiment of Śhakti Herself. Then He came as Macchindranāth, Zoroaster, and Muhammad Sāhab, who were a completely different type of human being.<br>
They trialed out lots of different things.<br> 
Śhrī Datta, the Primordial Masters firstly in this world educated us about the symbolic forms within us. And then also said that, "You people got entangled in symbolism, in idol worshiping." Their meaning was to go beyond and recognize the Śhakti within these idols. That's why They talked about the idols.<br>
<font color="red">For example, there is a flower, and to describe the honey within the flower, They talked about the flower first, from which the people would taste the honey. But people got stuck to flower. So Then they took Incarnations and talked about the honey.<br>
In that, They talked about God in the abstract. They deliberately didn't talk about the reincarnation of life.</font><br>
Because as soon as you talk about past lives, people ask Me, "Mātājī, tell me about my past lives." The life that has passed, why do you want to know that? Whether you were a king or a pauper, what difference it will make?<br>
That's why They did not discuss past lives.<br>
Muhammad Sāhab was the same, Dattātreya's Incarnation, and the same Incarnation was King Janaka. <font color="red">The same Incarnation was Nāṇaka, whose sister Nāṇakī, was the same Ādi Śhakti. She was Sītājī."</font><br>

"The same Śhrī Dattā incarnated many a times on the Earth.<br>
As I told you yesterday, King Janaka was one of Them. King Janaka was the father of Jānakī [Śhrī Sītā]. He was none other than the Incarnation of Śhrī Dattātreya.<br>
Thereafter, Macchindranāth, most have you must have heard His name, was also His Incarnation.<br>
After that Zoroaster who came three times on the Earth, He was also His Incarnation.<br>
After that Muhammad Sāhab, who was His Incarnation.<br>
And when He was asked that, "Bhāī [Brother], there must have been others also before You," then He replied, "Yes, there [was] a Muhammad." Then again He was asked who was before Him. He replied, "There was one Muhammad."<br>
Muhammad means Praise, the One who is praised, the One who deserves to be praised and is the One who is Redeemer of the world.<br> 
They were all Muhammads, They were all Dattātreyas, who came on Earth regularly.<br>
<font color="red">After that [was] Nāṇaka, Guru Nāṇaka. If you ever read His teachings, if you read His talks then you will be surprised that He has always talked in a Sahaja. He has said, "Sahaja Samādhi lago." He has said, "Kāhe re ban khojan jāe, Sarab nivāsī sadā alepā tohī saṃg[a] samāī, Puṣhpamadhya jo bāsa basata hai mukara māhī jaise chhāī, Taise hī harī base niraṃtara ghaṭa hī khojo bhāī." ["Why to go to forest to find Him, He is always there with you just like there is a fragrance in a flower and just as the reflection is there in a mirror, in the same way God is residing in you eternally, seek Him within."] He is just inside, achieve Him just inside. We are just singing poem, singing songs, we are just cramming His prescription.</font><br>
The talk of seeking this Absolute Principle, residing just inside the heart, has been made since ancient times by these Ādi Gurus, who are incarnated on this Earth again and again.<br>
......<br>
<font color="red">After Nāṇak Sāhab, around fifty, sixty years ago in our Maharashtra Dattātreya incarnated as Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī.</font> If you want proof of it, then you get your Realization and after that if you put your hand on anyone, then you will get vibration of same kind: from just vibration only you can know about all."<br>

<font color="red">"Like Nāṇak Sāhab has said, "Kāhe re ban khojan jāe, Sarab nivāsī sadā alepā tohī saṃg[a] samāī, Puṣhpamadhya jo bāsa basata hai mukara māhī jaise chhāī, Taise hī harī base niraṃtara ghaṭa hī khojo bhāī": "Why to go to forest to find Him, He is always there with you just like there is a fragrance in a flower and just as there is reflection in a mirror, in the same way God is residing in you eternally, seek Him within." They will repeatedly say, "Ghaṭ hi khojo" [seek Him within], "Ghaṭ hi khojo." It was just the prescription that they gave to take the medicine and we are just cramming that prescription."</font><br>

"<font color="red">And those who are fighting amongst themselves, they should also know: for whom they are fighting among themselves, are the same. Like for Muhammad Sāhib and Guru Nāṇak. Muhammad Sāhib and Guru Nāṇak was the same person. They had one identity.<br>
From the life of Nāṇakjī, I will tell you, once He was lying down. People asked Him, "Why are You lying down with Your Feet towards Mecca, where there is Kaaba?" He said, "OK, I turn My Feet, Kaaba has tuned."<br>
What is Kaaba? It is dust from Muhammad Sāhib's Feet and the same is of Nāṇak Sāhib also. Both are the same person and I will introduce Them in Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
When someone gets cancer, he can be cured by either Nāṇak Sāhib or Muhammad Sāhib, no one else.</font> Because what we call Void, is known to doctors, we call it Bhavasāgar, Dattātreya, who is Ādi Guru, who helps us in crossing Bhavasāgar, where all Gurus are present, unless you take the name of one of Them, you are not going to be free from problems of Bhavasāgar, which manifests as cancer. You can recognize cancer from the throb here. You cannot be cured.<br>
I want to ask, 'How many Muslims are here and how many Sikhs?'<br>
One thing, Muhammad Sāhib has prohibited the drinking of alcohol. He said, "Don't touch alcohol." He did not say anything. He was murdered. I know to what state He was reduced to.<br>
Sometimes at the mosque there will be fights over small leftovers.<br>
And I want to ask those Muslims who drink and remind them about Muhammad Sāhib. They won't like it and they definitely will drink alcohol. Not only that, [but] they wrote poetry on alcohol. For them alcohol is God."<br>

"So many Gurus and Avatāras, Ṛiṣhi Munis, have talked about ascent of man. <font color="red">Christ, Muhammad Sāhib, Guru Nāṇak, all these people have talked about this, 'That you have to go beyond this māyā [illusions], this Bhavasāgar [Void], this misidentification.'</font><br>
......<br>
These who believe in the reality of Hinduism, in the reality of their religion, must go to the essences of religion.<br>
<font color="red">Now there are many Sikhs. I can talk about Guru Nāṇak. Guru Nāṇak has clearly said, I would say nobody has said so clearly as He, so clearly has said it, "Kāhe re ban khojan jāe, Sarab nivāsī sadā alepā tohī saṃg[a] samāī, Puṣhpa madhaye jo was basat hai makar mahi jas jhahi, Taise he harī base niraṃtara ghaṭa hī khojo bhāī": you are just singing these songs from morning till evening in your Darabār Sāhib. These are the descriptions your Great Guru has given you to search within your ghaṭ. When are you going to do that? Stop all that!</font><br>
I am not against your bhajan. But now entertainment is not the way. Let it be over now. Let us search it within ourselves.<br> 
Find out that center which He has said. What are we singing about? Have we done any justice to our Guru? Have we done any justice to our Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya? Have we done any justice to Christ or to Muhammad Sāhib? We have not. We are doing just the opposite of what They have told us.<br>
Muslims are very fanatic people.<br>
I would say Muhammad Sāhib was the least fanatic personality.<br>
He suffered so much. I think, in that Incarnation, no Guru has suffered as much as He has. He suffered too much beyond description. Ultimately He was given poison. He was killed."<br>

"Many people have said this many times and if you look at all the great men of religion (dharm puruṣho), no one of Them took to saṃnyās. Except for the Nāth Pānthis. And even they had a difficult path.<br>
You know that Janak was a king and He lived like a king but people call Him Videhi [Videha, incorporeal]. That is why Jānakī is called Vaidehī.<br>
<font color="red">You know that Nāṇak was married and Kṛiṣhṇa also married.</font> Rāma also married. And like you, They were family loving people of the world. None of Them took saṃnyās, etc.<br>
Neither did these people gave importance to [Haṭha] Yoga. Only Patañjali gave special importance to [Haṭha] Yoga.<br>
But no one reads Patañjali also. They accept any fifth or sixthhand information coming about [Haṭha] Yoga. And considering it important, and they start doing Yoga what is called as Haṭha Yoga.<br>
Haṭha Yoga is very harmful for normal people who live in a family.<br>

"Despite the wealth, property, prosperity, power or position you have, you might [be] kings and queens but you won't get joy unless you stand in the Kingdom of Joy. When you stand in the Kingdom of Joy, then in any case you become kings and queens. No one can purchase you or conquer you. You conquer everything. You become kings.<br>

So, a committee of five scientists was formed to find out what are the effects of taking these drugs. When they went to find out, they got possessed by bhūts. As a result, the scientists themselves started smoking drugs and resigned from their jobs. If they were such great scientists then why did they start smoking marijuana? Why do they drink so much alcohol?<br>

"Now the ... these three aspects, the essence of these aspects, or we can say the innocence of these three aspects, is combined in the Primord[i]al Guru, or the Ādi Guru Dattātreya, who resides in the Bhavasāgara and helps Śhrī Viṣhṇu for your evolution.<br>
Now He has taken many Incarnations, mainly Ten Incarnations. And these are very important, and we have to understand Them in Their full entirety.<br>
If you accept Him as Dattātreya, you have to also accept Him as Rāja Janaka.<br>
It's easy for a Hindu mind to accept Rāja Janaka, but they cannot accept Muhammad Sāhab, who was same as Rāja Janaka. It is a fact which can ... we can prove it on your Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
A person who is suffering from cancer of the stomach &#8211; now this is the thing, when I say that Sahaja Yoga can cure your cancer, you have to give up certain notions that we have in our hear... head.<br>
A person, eh supposing he's a Hindu, and he's suffering from the stomach cancer, I have to ask him to take the name of Muhammad Sāhab. If I fail to ask him or if I convince ... do not him ... convince Him, I cannot cure his can't ... cancer. I'm sorry, I tell him, 'I just cannot do it.' But if he is a Muslim, I have to tell him: 'You have to take the name of Dattātreya.'<br>
Human beings, like fools, have taken away the living flowers of one tree, and now are fighting on something that is dead.<br>
He was Dattātreya. There is no doubt about it.<br>
And His daughter Fāṭimah was nobody else but Sītā Jānakī Herself.<br>
And Her two sons, Hasan and Husayn, were nobody else but Lava and Kuśha. They were born again and again: They were born as Mahāvīra and Buddha, and then They were born as Hasan and Husayn.<br>
It is only possible through Sahaja Yoga to realize that this is the Truth, this is the fact.<br>
<font color="red">He was born as Nāṇaka.</font> And Nāṇakī was nobody else but Jānakī.<br>
<font color="red">In Nāṇaka's life He has expressed it. Of course I don't know how many people have read about Nāṇak.<br>
Nāṇaka one day was sleeping, and His Feet were towards Kaaba. And people were getting vibrations from that side, so they said: "What are You doing your? Your Feet are towards Kaaba!" So He said, "All right, I'll turn My Feet's on the other side." And they started getting vibrations from the other side. They said, "What? Kaaba has moved or what?"<br>
He has, in a way, showed.</font><br>
'But how dare They say many things?' When They said very few thing[s], they have killed all these people and tortured Them.<br>
If you read Muhammad Sāhab['s] life, you will feel, 'What foolish people we have been, the way we have tortured [Him]!'<br>
For fanaticism the way He was killed!<br>
Actually was poisoned. He had no place where to hide His head the way people were after Him, because He was telling the Truth.<br>
And fanaticism is one thing He fought.<br>
So, Guru Tattwa is killed as soon as you become a fanatic person. Your Guru Tattwa is immediately finished, as soon as you take to fanaticism of any kind!"<br>

"<font color="red">From Nāṇakjī to Kabīr Dāsjī have talked about this.</font> I am talking about the modern time. Gyāneśhwarjī and all have spoken about it a lot. <font color="red">But nobody understood it.</font><br>
Like He [Kabīr Dās] said, "Pañcha pacchīsoṃ pakaṛ mām̐gauṃ, eka hī ḍorā baṛhaunāgā" [controlling five senses and twenty-five ways of experiencing the world and stringing them with the oneness of Inner Self much like a garland]. In this Kabīr Dāsjī, is talking about Collective Consciousness. He has spoken of Iḍā, Piṅgalā, and Suṣhumṇā naḍī, also about Śhūnya Śhikhar.<br>
<font color="red">Guru Nāṇak also has mentioned in His Granth.</font><br>
......<br>
Another thing is, here in Bhavasāgar, all Three, Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, Maheśhwar, combined to make a child, who is called Ādi Guru, is known as Dattātreya. There were many Incarnations of Him. And His Child Tattwa also took Incarnations. First was Dattātreya, then came Rāja Janak. <font color="red">Like this, many Incarnations came, Rāja Janak, Nāṇak, Zarathustra, Muhammad Sāhab, Sāī Nāth of Śhirḍī.<br>
They are all one. Are They or not? You can witness it after Self-realization. If you believe in one Guru, like Nāṇak, then you have no right not to accept Muhammad Sāhab. If you get Muhammad Sāhab and not Nāṇak, then you have no authority as well.</font><br>
You will be surprised, most of the cancer disease comes from the imbalance of Bhavasāgar, you follow one but not the other. Cancer also comes when we don't follow Them.<br>
Like He forbade two things, like not to smoke a cigarette and not to consume alcohol.<br>
Alcohol is entirely not allowed. Here, in Sahaja Yoga, if someone is habituated to drink alcohol, they will leave it. If they don't leave alcohol, it will [not] be in moderation because both of these things go against Guru Tattwa.<br>
If Guru Tattwa is not established within us, we cannot have our evolution. Guru Tattwa is essential. Guru Tattwa is one destiny for all religions. There is one flow from all the religions."<br>

But then He reincarnated many a times.<br>
At the time of Rāma, very early, even before Rāma came into this world, much earlier than that, He was created by Satī Anusūyā. She was Herself a part of the Ādi Śhakti, who created Him out of the essences, the innocence of Brahmā, Viṣhṇu and Maheśh.<br>

And She created Him. Actually, She created Him, so She's the Mother.<br>

"I have told you about Nābhī chakra and also about Void. The Guru Principle resides in this Bhavasāgara [Void] and this Guru Principle establishes the dharma within us. These ten petals here that we have shown are the ones which establishes the Ten Dharmas within us.<br>
It is important to have these Ten Dharmas in a human being otherwise he is not a human being. Even if he has has nine dharmas in him is still [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] a bit and if he does not follow these dharmas that are within him, and when I say dharma I don't mean by Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and all that, but dharma means the Innate Dharma of humanity within, if one does not keep to those Ten Dharmas, then he turns into a demon [devil].<br>
<font color="red">This Guru Principle (Tattwa) has taken birth in this world in many forms especially it has these Ten Main Incarnations have taken birth like Rāja Janaka, Nāṇak, Muhammad Sāhab, etc. and at the end it was Sāī Nāth from Śhirḍī, who took birth.

They said, "Child, don't drink alcohol, don't take to cigarettes, don't take any kind of drugs," because the position of our attention within is also placed in the area of Void.<br>
You will be surprised to know that our attention is in our stomach. Actually, to be specific, in liver resides our attention.<br>
They said, "You don't drink alcohol," so your attention does not get spoiled. You know by drinking human awareness gets damaged.<br>

There was another gentleman who was a staunch Hindu. And if they are staunch, they are the worst they can take up. [Laughter.] And I told him that he has to take the name of Muhammad.

"It is surprising that there is a gentleman in Rangoon who is an Avadhūta. Not only in India, but they can be found all around the world. Prophet Muhammad was an Avadhūta. <font color="red">King Janaka was an Avadhūta, so was Nāṇak.</font><br>
Many of them [Avadhūtas] did a lot of work in this Maharashtra. It is only because of their work here did I take My birth in this place.<br>
Sāī Nāth was the last of them from Maharashtra.<br>
Their work establishes the dharma. Or more like the dharma settles down in that place. They take their form on this earth only to fulfill that goal.<br>
When the human loses his faith in dharma, 'Why should I do this?', when he starts thinking this ways, then the Avadhūtas take birth on this Earth. And wherever they may be, in forests or mountains, dead or alive, all they do is keep working on giving you the validations of dharma.<br>

After this we were really lucky, specially people from Ahmadnagar, that Sāī Nāth who stayed in Śhirḍī [84 kms NNW from Ahmadnagar], He too is an Incarnation of Dattātreya. So, it is the same element of the Guru, which reappears on this Earth.<br>
And They taught several things regarding the balance of dharma. They didn't talk much about giving Realization as such. They did not work too much on giving knowledge on Self-enlightenment to people.<br>

"So the dharma that has been established in us by God Almighty because if we want to go to the Kingdom of God, then in our freedom we must desire to get to God. If someone tries to pressurize us and says, 'You must ask for God,' then it is of no use, it is not an evaluation. That is why to reach in this state, a person has to seek the God as per his own independent sweet will and not due to any pressure, or any disease or any hardships or any sorrow, but only because of the fact and realizing that, 'It is the only motive of our life to seek God.'<br>
<font color="red">That is why, when we desire for this Divine Gift, then the doors of God Almighty's Divine Blessings open for you, and around the center is a place of Ten Primordial Gurus. These are the Main Gurus which are the Incarnation[s] of Śhri Dattātreya. They are: Socrates, Moses, Muhammad Sāhab, Guru Nāṇak, Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth, and Zoroaster. They are all Incarnation[s] of one Incarnation.<br>
There is no difference between Muhammad Sāhab and Guru Nāṇak. When Muhammad Sahab saw that people are taking wrong interpretation of His Dharma and doing everything against the dharma, then He was born again as Guru Nāṇak to correct it. Because He wanted to bring unity among people but you know what happened during Their lives.</font>"<br>

"About Me also you can ask questions. There are many ways of recognizing because in this life, you have to recognize. You have never recognized an Incarnation so far. You have to recognize.<br>
That is compulsory and that is done through Sahajs Yoga because unless and until you are realized, how are going to recognize Them also?<br>
But even if you have not recognized Them, there was no need for you to crucify Them or to torture.<br>
<font color="red">Then all the Gurus who came on this Earth, the Real Ones &#8211; fakes are never gurus, they are not gurus &#8211; the Real Ones that came on this Earth, say, we can say Moses, Abraham, Nāṇak, Muhammad Sāhib, Kabīr, all these are Incarnations of Primordial Master whom we call as Dattātreya.</font><br>
<font color="red">If They are or not, if Muhammad Sāhib and Guru Nāṇak are the same personality, same people who came in different times, then what justice are we doing to Them?</font> How are we to find out? How are you to believe Me about it?<br>
I will give you an example. There was a Muslim gentleman from Iran who came to see Me, who was suffering from cancer. He asked Me: "Mother, I want to get cured." I said, "You['re] a Muslim?", he said, "Yes, I only believe in Muhammad Sāhib and nobody else!" I said, "This would be something like that, 'I only believe in my nose, and not in anything else.' "<br>
He was such a fanatic and fanaticism brings about the cancer of Nābhī chakra as we call it, the stomach. You will be amazed fanaticism is sin, sinful. It gives you the cancer of stomach.<br>
<font color="red">I asked him, "Will you worship Nāṇak Sāhib?" He said, "No, why should I? I am a Muslim." I said, "Do you know Muhammad Sāhib Himself is angry with you and you have to worship Nāṇak?"<br>
He would not but it happened for months and then he had to accept.</font><br>
Any extreme behavior of this kind is prohibited in all the religions.<br>
<font color="red">When Nāṇak came or when even our Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth came, They talked about sadāchār.</font> Even the Goddess's name is Sadāchār Pravartakā [Founder/Source of Good Conduct].<br> 
Sadāchār is the most important thing. The dhana [treasure] is the most important thing. One has to be in dharma. If you are adharmī, how do you expect Me to give you Realization, you just tell Me?<br>
<font color="red">Today I went to see a tailor of Mine who was saying, "Mother, if I am bad You tell me but why should not I get Realization?" I said, "True, why should not you? All right ask a question, 'Mother, are you Nāṇak?' " He asked Me the question. Normally the vibrations start but would not. He said, "What has happened to me?" I said, "See where is your Surati?"</font><br>
<font color="red">Nāṇak has described Kuṇḍalinī as Surati.</font><br>
His Kuṇḍalinī was pulsating at Nābhī. You could see with your naked eye. His friend or his proprietor was also seeing that. It was pulsating there.<br>
<font color="red">I said, "You have a liver. Do you drink?" He said, "I drink quite a lot." Then I said, "How do you expect Me to give you Realization in the name of Nāṇak who has prohibited all this?"</font><br>
When I say this people brand Me as anything.<br>
......<br>
Kuṇḍalinī knowledge is very much known to us.<br>
Actually we are so much anglicized, thanks to Lord [Thomas Babington] Macaulay, that a very few people who even know the word Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
If you read Kabīr, the whole thing, Kabīr is nothing but Sahaja Yoga.<br>
How many of you read Kabīr? For fashion sake even if they read they don't know what He is talking about.<br>
<font color="red">Nāṇak has talked about it, Gyāneśhwara has talked about it.</font><br>

"So, if you think evolution is a religion, then I would say Sahaja Yoga is the religion. If your evolution if you call it as a religion, then Sahaja Yoga is a religion. But is a religion which takes you belo ... beyond your sustenance, beyond your religion, dharmātīt, beyond the dharma.<br>
We have amongst ourselves Hindu[s], Muslims, Christians, all kinds of people, you know that. All these people can feel it within themselves: is the religion in their stomachs, they can feel it. They can find out where is the religion. Because, I say, there, religion in the stomach is looked after by the Deities of Primordial Master whom we call as Dattātreya, in the Sanskrit language.<br>
But does't mean Hinduism. It doesn't mean Hinduism at all. But it is called as Dattātreya in the Sanskrit language, in English is Primordial Master.<br>
<font color="red">He is the same who incarnated on this earth: as Moses, as Abraham, and, say, incarnated as Muhammad Sāhab, as Rāja Janaka, as Nāṇaka, and also as Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth. Can you believe that Muhammad Sāhab is the same as our Nāṇak?</font><br>
Now in the religion of these people, the Muslims, so-called, and the so-called Sikhs, are fighting amongst themselves.<br>
Can you believe that Mahāvīra and Buddha were the same as Hasan and Husayn? Which we can prove it to you on suh ... on vibrations and on curing people. They were the same people reincarnated just to improve on Themselves. Because people believe into something which They were not, so They were incarnated just to show: that, 'This was wrong. No, no, this was, I never said it! This was the thing.'<br>
<font color="red">In the story of ah ... Nāṇaka, it was said that once He was sleeping, so they said, "What? You are preaching that there should be unity among Hindus and Muslims, and You are putting Your Feet towards the Mecca!" He said, "Really?" Then He turned His Feet on the other side. He said, "Mecca has moved!"<br>
He was the religion, but not His followers. They drink, He allowed them to drink, did He?</font> When Muhammad Sāhab said, "Don't drink," that means they make a fanatic thing out of all that."<br>

"But still, as you can see in the life of Christ, that coming of Christ was declared much before Christ came in by the Prophets who made prophecies. All these Prophets belong to the category of the Gurus I am talking about.<br>
So, all over the world three types of movements were on. For example, the scientist[s] on the right-hand side, we can say, and the left-hand side are the devotees of God who sing the praise of God. And in the center there were people like Moses, like Abraham, who came on this earth just to prophesize, just to protect the devotees of God.<br>
Now this middle movement of evolution, today, has reached its peak. Because all the Incarnations have arrived now, and have done Their job within you. They have occupied Their position within you, in your awareness, on these different centers. <br>
......<br>
So today we are here to know that within us all these Incarnations exist, and the force that really brought forth, really manifested, who live like human beings and work like Gurus, that force which existed in this area, which created religion within us.<br>
Religion, as we understand, organized religion, is not the religion. But the religion means: your sustaining power. You are a human being because there are ten sustaining powers within you.<br>
So, They came to sustain us and to give us full idea about these Ten Powers and to establish us in our religion as a human being.<br>
So these Gurus, who lived in that area, worked out the sustainace [sustenance] and helped us.<br>
And this is one of the greatest forces we have got, which resides within us.<br>
And whatever They have said has a very great meaning.<br>
Actually, we should say the Main Gurus are ten, but there are many other Gurus.<br>
And these Ten Gurus could be described as Rāja Janaka, then Moses, Abraham, and the in modern times you can say Muhammad Sāhab, and even up to Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth, in Śhirḍī, that force came in, for a short time, and then He disappeared. Nobody knows how He came there, He lived there and He died. <font color="red">Also, if you know Nāṇaka, He was also the same force, the same Primordial Master, who was born on this Earth.</font><br>
Now, this is not the time to tell about individual people. But, I think, one day I will talk to you only on this subject of the Gurus.<br>
So, these Gurus first started under the Primordial Master Himself, He was called as Dattātreya.
......<br>
There's one more point I would like to tell you, that they have not yet gone here, but here [<font color="orange">unclear</font>], there are the two uh more small uh-uh-uh chakras: one that belongs to, uh uh which we call as the Sūrya &#8211; Sūrya is the-uh-uh uh uh, means the Sun, the Sun center &#8211; and the another as the Moon center on the left-hand side. And these two are uh governed or, we can say, is uh bestowed upon by two great uh-uh-uh people, who are the Disciple Elements.<br>
And They, disciple elements were first, were born to Śhrī Rāma and Śhrī Sītā as the-ee Lav and Kuśh. And then They incarnated many a times on this Earth as disciple. One of Them is, we can say, ah ... was uh Śhaṅkarāchārya, another was Kabīra, uh like that. Then, we can say, later on, uh like, uh before Śhaṅkarāchārya, they came as Buddha and Mahāvīra. Then Śhaṅkarāchārya, and then, uh I told you, which is? Uh after Śhaṅkarāchārya came ... the Advent of Hasan and Husayn, who were the grandsons of Prophet.<br>
So these have been incarnating, and they have been moving from one uh-uh-uh side to another and telling people that, "This is extreme, leave it." "This is the extreme, leave it. Come in the center, and be in the center." That has been Their job. And they are the ones who are, sort of, imparting you that awareness by you become a perfect disciple.<br>
And the ... this is a very important point because it comes, quite often, that uh-uh-uh we do not understand.<br>
Like Prophet Muhammad said that: "I am the last Prophet." All right, He did say He was the last Prophet.<br>
Supposing I say, I am the last person to come here. All right I would say just to frighten you that, 'h-oh, you better take to it otherwise this is the last time I am telling you!' [Laughs.]<br>
But it is never that!<br>
Because when He wa... died He found out: that, you see, these people are madcaps. 'I didn't tell them this, what are they doing out of Me?' So, He said, 'I better go back again.'<br>
<font color="red">And He came as Nāṇaka. And He told them, that: "Hindu and Muslims are same people, following the same religion, why are you fighting among yourselves?" See, They came for that unity.<br>
Then as Nāṇaka He came. So, in Nāṇaka's system also the Sikhism came in and they started a warrior class and this and that. I mean imagine, the Sikhism ended up by having wars within Muslims and Hindus.</font><br>
<font color="red">So, then He came as Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth to teach them.</font><br>
Now, this is not a very important thing that, say Muhammad Sāhab said, "I am the last." Say He is the last, all right, even take that position. Who are you to Him? How are you related? Through what? What is your authority? How do you appropriate Him to yourself? Because you say you are Muslims, so what? How did you become Muslims? Did you get your certificate from God?"<br>

"Now when They said, "Don't drink," you say, 'Oh-oh, that's out-of-dated. You see, there's Muhammad Sāhab, was no good. He told us not to drink.' <font color="red">Nāṇaka said, "Don't drink."</font><br>
Now, smoking, you see the results of smoking, now what's happening with smoking. It goes against uh uh your Viśhuddhi. Because, you see, that is the place of Kṛiṣhṇa, and smoking started much later. You see, when He was much earlier, smoking started later on.<br>
<font color="red">That's why Nāṇak Sāhab has talked about it much more.</font><br>
But uh Muhammad Sāhab did see this point, He did see. So He said, "All ... all the inter... intoxicants and all habits are to be discarded. All such things must be discarded." So, He also wanted mhh yeah ...<br>
...... [Conversation to identify the English word addiction.]<br>
All these addictions must be given up. He said it, very clearly: "No addictions are allowed," according to Him.<br>
But you see, how you make uh-uh-uh uh-uh fuss about things.<br>
Like Muhammad Sāhab and all these Gurus, all these Great Incarnations of the Primordial Master who was Ādi Dattātreya, Ādinātha [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], They taught you how to maintain your religion, your sustainance [sustenance], your balance.<br>
So, immediately the Christians. Because Christ didn't talk much about it because Moses had talked about it, Abraham had talked about it. So Christ did not talk, so they said, "All right. So Christians can drink." Just imagine.<br>
This is a loophole.<br>
That's how they became Christians perhaps. Because they thought that if ... uh they were belonged to the Jews, you see, then they would have ... uh they wouldn't be able to drink.<br>
But Jews drink like Hell. Jews also drink now! I mean the Muslims drink the most, you see.<br>
And worst are the Sikhs: who are prohibited from drinking and smoking, they can beat all your scotch people here, you see. All your scotch whiskey goes into their stomachs [laughter], all these things, and they grow in this, this  beard, thinking that they are great Sikhs going around, you see."<br>

"Around that, is that area where actually it exists in the stomach of God, we can say, this is the Bhavasāgara. This is what we have to cross. You see there's a Void, from there to there is a Void, and this we have to cross. And this is the thing which is crossed by the Kuṇḍalinī awakening.<br>
<font color="red">Now what happens? That around that uh ... that ... water-like thing that you see there, see that is the one where Ten ... the Primordial Masters were born, Gurus, Primordial Gurus. Now They were incarnated of innocence of all this three aspects. And They were incarnated on this Earth, say, from Abraham, Moses, then we had uh-uh-uh ... up to Muhammad Sāhab we can say, then we can say Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth, then Nāṇaka, Janaka, all these people incarnated as Gurus.</font><br>

And this sustenance is maintained by the Gurus in that area. And They look after us: They are born again and again, again and again, to tell us about it.<br>

Now there is a reason, which you cannot stop it. If I tell you, 'Don't drink,' you come and drink.<br>
I'll give you [a] very good reason for that, absolutely scientific, absolutely scientific. But you won't stop. So what should I do?<br>

"<font color="red">When Śhrī Rām came, people said that they accepted Paraśhurām, when Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa came they said, they accepted Śhrī Rām, and at the time of Śhrī Nāṇaka, they accepted Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.</font> When Christ was here they accepted Abraham.<br>
All of Them had taken human form. But it is all the play of buddhi: how interesting it is!<br>
Now, I have come and people are accepting Śhrī Sāī Nāth.<br>
But when He lived here, He did not even get anything to eat. Why was it so? He was also a human being. As long as He was alive, He too was considered useless and tortured. But when He died, He was regarded as Bhagavān.<br>
What is the reason of this all? Why has man been like this?<br>
You will have water of the Ganges, where She flows. If She is flowing here, will you say, 'We do not accept Her as the Ganges!'? There may be nothing at the place where She was flowing earlier, or maybe only a nullah [ravine] at present. If you want to take it as the Ganges, you go your way. If the Ganges is flowing at this place, why not accept it?<br>
It is not easy to understand human intellect. It is the most difficult job in the world! It is easy to understand God, because He is what He is. He does not have such double dealings. Man has a variety of qualities, not just double. All animals from snakes and scorpions to elephants, horses and lions are residing in him. You will not understand at all, why his brain is working in this way.<br>
Now when the Ganges is flowing why don't you take water from Her?<br>
Imagine this plug has been connected here. Will you connect in its place a plug which is out of order? It is quite pragmatic.<br>
I cannot understand what hallucination is there on human intellect, that he does not accept the Truth which he is seeing but accepts something that is not seen?
Its reason was understood long back and that is ahaṅkār [ego]. Man has too much of ego.<br>
If you had accepted Śhrī Rāma in His days, He would have told you to get your Kuṇḍalinī awakened and get the Realization and get established in Sahaja Yoga.<br>
Had you recognized Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, He would not have played Sahaja Yoga in Gokul, but would have given you the Realization and told you to practice Sahaja Yoga.<br>
<font color="red">If Śhrī Nāṇak had been accepted, there was no need for Him to break His head telling you to do different things. He would have simply taught Sahaja Yoga, but very few understood Him in His days.<br>
Now, when He is not here, you have built gurudwārās in His name.</font><br>
When Muhammad is not here mosques have been made, because they think now Muhammad Sāhib is in their hands.<br>
Now Rāma is in their hands, and they can make His temple and say, 'His is our temple, this Rāma is our property. We have authority over Him and whatever you have brought, all money and other things, offer them to this idol.'<br>
You say all this because you think you are the authority of this idol. It is sheer ego because of which man thinks, that he can keep God in his control and for that he is making all the show. Every time the same show was repeated."<br>

"People crucified Jesus Christ because of their ego. They could not conceive of an idea that some human being can appear on the Earth as an Incarnation of God. Their intellectual pride could not accept this idea and they rejected the Truth because of the ego.<br>
What was the bad deed for which Jesus was crucified? He had on the contrary cured many people of their ailments. He preached the Truth and taught many good things to the people. He showed them the way to live a very cultured life. He always preached Love.<br>
In spite of this, the people tortured Him. But they would bow before those who teach filthy and rotten things and make a fool of them. What a height of stupidity!<br>
These days any Tom, Dick or Harry becomes a guru, robs the people, squeezes money from them. Such persons are held in high esteem.<br>
On the contrary, if a good person, who stands by the Truth, wishes to show the true path, the people not only won't listen to him but assault him.<br>
To educate such very stupid people God Almighty sent His beloved Son, Jesus Christ, on this Earth. But the people crucified Him.<br>
They have been, ever since, repeatedly doing the same thing. If you read, you will find that whenever God incarnated, or any Sage or Saint took birth on this Earth, the people have harmed them and tortured them. Instead of learning from them, they behaved with them stupidly. We will notice the same story about Śhrī Gyāneśhwara and Śhrī Tukārāma, the great Saints of Maharashtra. <font color="red">Similar treatment was meted out to Śhrī Guru Nāṇaka and Prophet Muhammad.</font><br>
Man always runs away from the Truth and tries to embrace the untruth.<br>
......<br>  
When we study the life of Jesus Christ, one thing is noticed prominently. That is the stupidity of the people of that time. Because of that stupidity this magnificent personality was crucified. And what height of stupidity! When the people were asked to express their opinion as to whether a thief or Jesus be released, the Jews demanded that the thief be released and Jesus Christ crucified.<br>
We know the state of these people today! The sin committed by them will not be washed away in many, many lives. And even now these persons are enveloped in their ego. They think that they have done a virtuous deed.<br> 
Even now, if these people seek pardon of God, saying that, 'Oh God, pardon us for crucifying your sacred principle. Forgive us for destroying your sacred principle,' God will immediately forgive them.<br> 
But man finds it very difficult to apologize. He commits a number of evil deeds.<br> 
How many persons can be found in the world who have worshiped the Saints?<br> 
<font color="red">Take the instance of Śhrī Kabīr or Śhrī Guru Nāṇaka. The people have persecuted Them at every step.</font><br> 
In this world the people have not given anything to the Saints except harm and torture.<br> 
But I tell you now, that circumstances have changed. The Satya Yoga has commenced. You may try, but now you would not succeed in persecuting or torturing any Saint.<br> 
This is due to Jesus Christ Himself. For Jesus Christ has set in motion a mighty power in this world which would make such wicked people suffer. They would be punished. The Ekādeśha Rudras of Jesus Christ are all in readiness to strike. Those who would now torture any Saint, would be completely ruined.<br> 
It is a great sin to torture any Saint. You try to understand this from the example of Jesus Christ. Do not commit such stupidity hereafter. Otherwise you may get completely ruined.<br> 
If one great lesson is to be learnt from the life of Jesus, then that is that you have to remain contented in the state in which the Almighty has placed you. Jesus did not change His mission, He did not separate Himself from the society, considering Himself to be a saṃnyāsī. On the contrary, on occasions He attended certain marriage ceremonies and made the arrangements. Tile Bible says that at one marriage occasion He transformed drinking water into fresh grape Juice.<br>
Now, man has picked up this one incident to suggest that, 'Since Jesus Christ made wine out of water, He used to drink wine.' In Hebrew language you would notice that the word wine means pure juice of fresh grapes. It does not mean alcohol.<br> 
Jesus Christ incarnated to open the Āgñyā chakra and to dissolve our ego.<br>
My job is to awaken your Kuṇḍalinī Power so that it could pierce your Sahasrāra chakra.<br>
<font color="red">This work is of collective nature: I have, therefore, to do it in the case of one and all, I want to tell you about Jesus Christ, Guru Nāṇaka, King Janaka and a number of other Incarnations and the way they relate with the collectivity.</font> Similarly, I wish to talk to you about Incarnations of Śhrī Rāma, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, etc., and also about Śhrī Śhiva because all the Powers of these Gods and Deities are in us. Now, the time has come for Collective Consciousness to manifest."<br>

Dattātreya is the essence, and He is born as Socrates, He is born as Lao Tze, He is born as Abraham, as Moses, He is born as, up till now we can say, Muhammad Sāhab, Nāṇaka, latest is the Sāī Nāth of Śhirḍī.</font> He is the One who [pointing with one more circle inside the Void on the Chakra Chart:] represents, They all represent, this Primordial Master's Principle of Religion."<br>

"Today I would like to say about this chakra especially that is the ... what we call the Nābhī chakra, is the central path of our evolution where you start your seeking and youge [you] cross over to [the] other side.<br>
Now, surrounding this you will find there is the Ocean of Illusion. And this Ocean of Illusion was governed by a Deity, by a special powerful personality whom we call as Dattātreya &#8211; is the Primordial Master. And He incarnated on this Earth many a times. At the time of Christ, and even before that, He incarnated as, say, Abraham, Moses, Socrates, Lao Tze. <font color="red">Later on, He incarnated as Muhammad Sāhab, then the same Great Principle incarnated as Nāṇaka, then the same Principle at the last incarnated as Sāī Nāth of Śhirḍī.</font><br>
So the same Great Principle of this Primordial Master has incarnated because without a master, how will you be taken away from in ... this illusion? How you are going to be exposed to that reality which you do not feel?<br>
What has to happen to you is that you have to become more sensitive, more open, awakened, enlightened to feel that's All-pervading Power around you.<br>
Now, these [masters] came again and again and told you that you must look after your dharma.<br>
Dharma doesn't mean any religion that is being established in the names of these people, because human beings know how to make a pickle out of everyone. They are great 'experts'.<br>
All of Them in essence are one and the same.<br>
But like flowers on the same tree can be taken away from time to time and then when they become ugly and they become completely spoilt, then people can claim, 'This is my flower,' 'This is my flower.' Everybody has become a contractor of this thing.<br>
Actually these people belong to the whole universe, They are universal beings and They came on this Earth to give us a sustainance [sustenance] within us, a sustainance [sustenance].<br>
Dharma means a sustainance [sustenance], that is we can say, that is quality that is ... that is human."<br>

So, to celebrate His [Śhrī Guru Nāṇaka's] birthday, on such a date, is also a myth because He never died. He is eternally living: They never grow and They never die.<br>
But His birth is important, because, symbolically, He came on this Earth not to propagate any particular type of the Void as Muhammad did, or, say, Moses did, David, Moses and then, before that Abraham, Lao Tze, or Socrates, which followed into a religion.

This uh-huhh ... lasted for out tuh [the] twelfth century, when One of them published in His book, Gyāneśhwara, He published in His book, in the sixth chapter, about Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
It's a-uh-uh ... we can say, an a... exposition of the Gītā. But this ... uh, you see, this Gītā which was written, not by Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, Vyāsa, He wrote what you have to become. Just like what Christ said. Just uh-uh-uh just like what Qur'ān says.<br>
So, when everybody said the same thing, it was never told how to achieve it. That is how this knowledge was not given.<br>
Till the sixteenth century, [when] in India we had lots of great Saints. Like Guru Nāṇaka, Kabīra, Nāmadeva, so many of them. In Maharashtra like Rāmadāsa, Tukārām. They, also, said: that, 'Is the Kuṇḍalinī which gives you Realization' -- clearly.<br>

"The Primordial Master was also born as Macchindranāth, and again as Zoroaster who was worshiped by the ancient Persians, and still revered by Parsis. Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism. In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates. He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). <font color="red">Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā).</font> Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918.

The cunning, depraved false gurus reap most of their earnings from innocent Western seekers, and lead a luxurious lifestyle on their income. These gurus are patently immoral, yet Westerners are so fascinated and enticed by them that they are willing to commit even debauchery at their request. They will commit every sin under the sun to please their gurus and guruwis. I personally know a nineteen-year-old boy who was directed to sleep with an old lady of sixty by one of these gurus, and he did it! He came to Me in a very sick and debilitated state. Another case also personally known to Me concerned a young American who went to India to find Me. Unable to trace Me there, he finally caught up with Me in London. He was a very intelligent young man, studying for a post-graduate degree at a prestigious American university. He told Me how he had enrolled in meditation classes taught by one of these gurus, and learned there the art of going into trance."<br>

"This was how human beings paid homage to their Primordial Parents, God their Father and Ādi Śhakti their Mother, under the influence of these tāntrikas. They actually committed a sin against the virtue of chastity. Chastity is the power of Ādi Śhakti, the Primordial Mother, and everywhere tāntrikas have ruled, women were insulted and treated as a possession and a toy for the cruel enjoyment of men. The erotic images that mar these beautiful temples should not be taken as a sign that public opinion approved. It was the opinion of very few people, who ruled under hypnosis, that counted in those days, who were convinced they had achieved sexual liberation by delving into it. Many saintly people protested against the blackmail and the pornography of those times. There is historical evidence of uprisings against such kings who tried so hard to shame God. <font color="red">In later periods many courageous poets like Kabīr and Nāṇak used Their talents as writers to scourge the tāntrikas.</font>"<br>
