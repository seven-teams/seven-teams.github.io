"<font color="red">She [Śhrī Ādi Śhakti] was incarnated in the form of Satī Anusūyā. This is the only such a Satī in the whole world who has thought of emancipation of the human beings. This is a very great thing.<br>
These Three Children [Śhrī Brahmā, Śhrī Viṣhṇu and Śhrī Maheśhwar] came to Anusūyā.<br>
The meaning of Anusūyā is the One who is void of envy, She does not envy anyone, who is the Universal Love.<br>
In such a person there is no place for insignificant, petty thoughts such as jealousy, anger, etc. The one who does not have any asūyā, she is Anusūyā.<br>
It is said that these Three went to Her door to examine Her. And that moment She used Her Tej Bal.</font><br>
What was this Tej Bal? This was the Love of Mother, very much divine, Love of a powerful Mother.<br>
This Tej Bal fell on Them and They became small children.<br>
Their complete unified form is Śhrī Dattā Mahārāj.<br>
He is a strange Majesty, whatsoever description is made of Him but will fall short. And even if this is made to be explained, it will be beyond explanation.<br>
This is Śhrī Dattā Mahārāj who is full of triguṇa.<br>
He came in the world in form of Ādi Guru many times to teach how to cross the Bhavasāgara [Void]."<br>

"Nobody can con an innocent man. This is true. Even if someone tries to con, there will be such a drama, the person himself will be conned.<br>
If Sītā was caught in the guile of Rāvaṇa, it was a display of Her innocence. He had no stature to hold Her hand or misbehave with Her. Where is the glory of innocence and where is the cunningness of Rāvaṇa? No one can aggress an ordinary woman.<br>
But till such time he carried Sītā on his head, he remembered his own mother. All his greatness was reduced to the size of a small child.<br>
<font color="red">You have heard the story of Satī Anasūyā, is it not?</font><br>
The condition of Rāvaṇa was also similar. She has made Her innocence dance. She got into Sahaja Yoga in Her innocence.<br>
That will give you motherhood."<br>

"Now, this Guru was created when the world was created itself. Because we ... one had to create a Guru before the world was created in then Vaikuṇṭha Stage only.<br>
But then He reincarnated many a times.<br>
<font color="red">At the time of Rāma, very early, even before Rāma came into this world, much earlier than that, He was created by Satī Anusūyā. She was Herself a part of the Ādi Śhakti, who created Him out of the essences, the innocence of Brahmā, Viṣhṇu and Maheśh.<br>
There's a legend about it which I will tell you sometime.<br>
And She created Him. Actually, She created Him, so She's the Mother.</font><br>
But then, She becomes the Guru.<br>
When She is born as Sītā, He becomes the father. So, She ... father is Her Guru.<br>
Then, when Rāja Janaka is born as Muhammad Sāhab, then She becomes again the daughter.<br>
But when He is born as Nāṇaka, then He becomes the ... She becomes His sister.<br>
So the relationship exists and whenever He is born, She is born, in a way, that, you see, that relationship is kept a sublime relationship. I mean to say: that they are never born as husband and wife."<br>

"<font color="red">Like there was uh-uh-uh another one, Anasūyā: was another very great uh woman in India, Anasūyā. She was so great! She changed, I mean She ... She made the sun wane, She made the river change its course, She did all kinds of things for Her husband who was a horrid fellow. [Some laughter.] He was absolutely the dirtiest possible fellow with all these diseases because of dirty things he did all his life, you see. And he would ill-treat Her and every... Then he ... She ... he got horrible diseases because, you see, all his life he was so [<font color="orange">unclear</font> frustrated]. Then he got leprosy, he got this. She took him from one place to another to all the temples and everything, and She defied all the nature, everything. This Satī Anusūyā, you see.

But She loved somebody and wanted to marry some[one], you see, so She dedicated Herself fully to that love. Then She became this river, you see. And it's a Virgin River.<br>
[After a Sahaja Yogi says something:] So, in India, you see, people do not take out water from that River Narmadā. They just say: 'All right. This is the river we are not going to touch, we are not going to take out the uh water out of this river.'<br>
I mean, it was so deep into us, you see, we had known all these things and everything.<br>
So, the Satī used to be feared very much, you see.<br>
I'm also a little afraid of them, [laughing:] the way they [as some Sahaja Yogis laugh:] are, you see. Oh-oh, and if someone has a husband, you know, who is uh-uh-uh wanting a divorce from a Satī, I think: 'I'm out of it! I'm not [as some Sahaja Yogis laugh:] for it, you see. Keep Me out! I'm not.'<br>

"So, these Gurus first started under the Primordial Master Himself, He was called as Dattātreya.<br>
And this G... Dattātreya is the One who is comprising all these forces: say, the existence force and the evolutionary force and the creative force, all of them, in Its innocence.<br>
I don't know if you understand it, but there is a story about Them is, that there are Three Deities, which belong to these Three Forces: the left one is Śhiva's Force, then the right one is Brahmadeva's Force, and the center one is Viṣhṇu's Force. <font color="red">So they say that all these Three Gods felt that the wife of Dattātreya [Sage Atreya] was a great, uh devoted woman. And She would, with Her powers, can curse anyone She feels like. So They wanted to take a ... take Her test and wanted to find out: how far She was a devoted wife.<br>
So They went to Her. And the They told Her that, "We want some alms."</font><br>
And in ... in India, it is regarded as a great honor to be able to give somebody alms who come to your house.<br>
<font color="red">And Three Saints, they were dressed up like Saints, They came on the door, so, when They asked for alms, She said, "All right, uh I will get you some alms." They said, "No! We'll come inside the house, and uh You have to become completely naked, and then give Us the alms."</font><br>
Because to become naked before a man, you lose all your powers as a uh-uh-uh devoted wife, as a Satī.<br>
<font color="red">She said, "All right. If you say so, I will do it." And She started taking out Her clothes. As soon as She touched Her clothes, you see, They became small children, absolutely small children. [Laughing:] And She took out Her clothes, and gave Them the alms.</font><br>
So, these three small children, put together, made the Dattātreya, is the Guru, is the One who is innocent like a child. Innocent like a child, who has no sense of sex.<br>
So, we come to conclusion: a guru who has interest in women, a guru who has interest in sex, is not a guru but is anti-Guru.<br>
Dattātreya is the innocence of all these Three Powers."<br>

"<font color="red">The story is about the Advent of the Primordial Master, you see. That Three Deities, of Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, Maheśha, you know who They are, uh-uh-uh .. They've ... Their wives, see Their Powers, felt, they say were jealous of a Lady who was very pure, actually Anasūyā.<br>
She is the Power of the Primordial ... She's the Mother. I mean She was the Primordial Mother. She's the Mother of all the Gurus, you see.<br>
And the ... They [the wives] ... They said that, "She ... She is, this Lady is such a chaste lady, and You must go and the ... make Her fall from Her chastity. You test Her fully." And She was actually the Primordial Mother, you see. So they went into Her house, you see. She was the wife of a very big Saint. And the -- he was out -- and They said, "We want uh-uh-uh ..."</font><br>
You see, a guest who comes to your house can demand anything, according to Indian dharma.<br>
<font color="red">So They came in and They'll said that, "We want You to serve our food naked. Take out all Your clothes and You must[<font color="orange">unclear</font>]."</font><br>
Now, you can't say no to your guests. Because that is your dharma.<br>
"It's all right, I will do it."<br>
<font color="red">And She said ... as soon as She started, both of Them -- undressing -- both of Them became small, little children. Three of Them. [As a Sahaja Yogi laughs:] Little, little babies, you see, She undressed Herself. And the little baby doesn't understand anything, and She nursed Them together. And She ... then She said, "Now!" She combined Them together, and that's how Dattātreya [has] three faces. Innocence of these people, She brought Them to Their innocences -- was created. This is the innocence of all these Three Deities was[<font color="orange">unclear</font>].</font><br>
Because Christ is the innocence[<font color="orange">unclear</font>].<br>
These three form this innocence part to balance you.<br>
And [moving twice the right index finger along the top part of the forehead, from left to right:] at this stage They come, here, as[<font color="orange">unclear</font>]."<br>

"<font color="red">This one, is today's Pūjā, it has a special meaning because yesterday was Dattā Jayanti: means the uh birth of Dattātreya. And you know the story of Dattātreya, most of you know the story of Dattātreya, that Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, Maheśha tried to uh take a test of a uh-uh-uh Ādi Śhakti, called Anasūyā. They came to Her place and asked Her uh for alms.</font><br>
And is supposed to be a great privilege in India to give alms to others, to -- I mean, it's a great privilege to attend to guests, it's a great privilege to be generous, it's [laughing:] great privilege to distribute things to others. It's a great privilege."<br>

"Last time you had asked Me for Guru Pada. And you should know that the essence of Guru is Śhrī Gaṇeśha, the innocence.<br>
<font color="red">You must be knowing the story of a very devoted wife, faithful wife, of a Satī, Her name was Anasūyā, and She was so religious and so dedicated that they say that the wives of all the Gods, Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, Maheśha, got very jealous of Her. So, They told Their husbands that, "You must go and test Her, if She is really a woman with chastity or not."<br>
So all of Them came down as Sādhus, dressed up like saṃnyāsīs. And She said it, She wanted to serve Them, give Them something. They said, "No, We want to have food." She said, "All right, come and sit down." She cooked food for them. So They said, "No, We will not have the food unless and until You take out all Your clothes. We will only ha... have the food unless and until You take out all Your clothes. We'll only have the food if You take out all your clothes." She said, "Is it so?" She [They] said, "Yes." So She made Them into little, little children, three little children. [Laughing:] And then She became nude, because innocent doesn't understand anything about [it]. And then is She joined Them together, Their three innocence was joined together, and They got Their Guru Pada.</font><br>
That's how the Ādi Guru was created."<br>

"Maheśha (Śhiva), Viṣhṇu and Brahmadeva form the Trinity which incarnated as one teacher God, the Primordial Master, Dattātreya. He came onto this Earth to teach people the secrets of the Divine, to reveal God, and to help them cross the Ocean of Illusion themselves within their own identity. Evolution could not go further in the hands of human beings who were in the bondage of ignorance, so they were given guidance through this Incarnation of the Primordial Master (Ādi Guru) again and again in different lives. <font color="red">He was created as the three-headed child, Dattātreya, by Ādi Śhakti who appeared on Earth during the Tretā Yuga as Satī Anasūyā, wife of the Sage Atreya.</font><br>
