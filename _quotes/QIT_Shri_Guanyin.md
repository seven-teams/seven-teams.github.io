<font color="DarkRed">"While they searched back into the history of China, and they found out: the Ādi Śhakti lived many years back there as Quānyīn [Guānyīn]. And that's how Quānyīn [Guānyīn] was established as a Goddess for many Buddhist[s]."</font><br>

<b>Sahaja Yogi:</b> The Goddess Kuan Yen [Guānyīn], Śhrī Mātājī, ...<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> <font color="DarkRed">Yes.<br>
<b>Sahaja Yogi:</b> ... can You tell us something about it [Her]?<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> <font color="DarkRed"> Kuan Yin [Guānyīn]?<br>
<b>Another Sahaja Yogi:</b> Kuan Yin [Guānyīn]!<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> <font color="DarkRed">Yes? You want to know about Her?<br>
That's an Incarnation of one of the ... yuh ... I mean in the Chinese mythology you find the Incarnation described of Kuan Yin [Guānyīn]. And actually, She is the One, who is the Vṛuddhā, is described as Vṛuddhā, She is the One, is the Aged One. Uh-uh-uh because uh Kuan Yin [Guānyīn] was born to a king. She was the daughter of a king. And She was the Virgin Form of the Goddess, and She would not marry. So Her father got very angry with Her, that She is not marrying. And he threatened Her, because he had arranged Her ... His marri... uh marriage with some great king, you see. And when the marriage took pla... mariage did not take place, father was so angry and annoyed and felt very humiliated. So, he-ee took Her to a hillside and got ... said ... threatened [Her] that, "I will throw You down." And actually She was thrown down from the hillside into a valley, and he thought, 'She must have been dead.'<br>
But there was a tiger, which held Her, and he carried Her along, and then he looked after Her. And when She grew very old, quite old, then She came out of Her hermitage. And She started prea... treating people. And many people got cured by Her.<br>
But She was quite old, then the father recognized Her. Because father was sick. She went and treated the father also. And She started curing people.<br>
And that's the Kuan Yin [Guānyīn].<br>
Uh-uh-uh if you go to Hong Kong, you can see Her statue: the face is very much like Mine, absolutely. But She is older looking, and Her uh shoulders are bent, quite bent.<br>
But She came much before Christ.<br>
And the uh-uh-uh ... the Buddhist felt that, 'People wouldn't give Her up, because She was so much regarded as the Mother of Mercy.' So, they included Her in the Buddha uh-uh-uh thing.</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> We have Chinese also who are very wise. And the ... they are known to be people of deep understanding. But they are not like Indians.<br>
So, what is lacking in all these people is: the depth of awareness. Because-ss, though in China also Mother of Mercy came, and She really uh-uh-uh bestowed blessings upon them, and China rose also, afterwards, into her own glory and became quite a good industrial, I mean developed country, we can say, very powerful, but still, that kind of regimentation could not be borne. <font color="DarkRed">Because, after all, Mother Mercy was there.</font><br>
<font color="DarkRed">Do you know last -- you have one Mother Mercy to give ... you have given Me ...</font><br>
<b>Sahaja Yogi:</b> [<font color="orange">unclear</font>].
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> Ahh?
<b>Sahaja Yogi:</b> [<font color="orange">unclear</font>].
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> Or Kuan Yin [Guānyīn], same thing. Kuan Yin [Guānyīn] -- and She's the same thing, called as Mother of Mercy.<br>
And the second one was given by Grégoire recently.<br>
And you see what's happening in China now.<br>
So the effects of these Deities which existed in different countries at different times, are felt only in Kali Yuga in the best way.<br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> And Bodhisattva is the one when you are realized, you have found the Truth, you have to give it to the society, you have to give it to the public, you have to go all out to give it. That's Sahaja Yoga.<br>
So Buddhism, at that stage, was: achieving your Self, alone.<br>
<b>Sahaja Yoginī:</b> Oh, I see.<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> Or your little group.<br>
<b>Sahaja Yoginī:</b> Mh-hm.<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> Now, today, it is Bodhisattva.<br>
<b>Sahaja Yoginī:</b> Because the Buddhists, a lot of them believed in the Goddess of Mercy, ...<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> What?<br>
<b>Sahaja Yoginī:</b> Goddess of Mercy, Quānyīn [Guānyīn].<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> <font color="DarkRed">Quānyīn [Guānyīn], they believed.</font><br> 
<b>Sahaja Yoginī:</b> Yes, Goddess of Mercy.<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> <font color="DarkRed">[In] Quānyīn [Guānyīn] they believed.</font><br>
<b>Sahaja Yoginī:</b> Yes.<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> <font color="DarkRed">She looks like Me very much.</font> [Laughter, smiles.]<br> 
<b>Sahaja Yoginī:</b> But I try to talk to them like that, and some of them, because of the barrier of uh races and nationality: "Oh, no, no, no! Look at this picture: is not!", and this and that. Is so hard to convince them.<br>
And my's ... my-my real desire, I like to talk to these people, especially in my area, there are lots of them are Quānyīns [Guānyīns].<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> <font color="DarkRed">But you should say, 'Now, there is no Quānyīn [Guānyīn].'<br>
And when She lived, nobody recognized Her.<br>
Who, Her own father wanted to throw Her away. And a tiger came and saved Her. And She actually appeared on the scene when She was about, I think, ninety years She [was], something like that, very old.</font><br>
<b>Sahaja Yoginī:</b> Mh-hm.<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> So, nothing much was done.<br>
<font color="DarkRed">But they could recognize that She was the Goddess.</font><br>
<b>Sahaja Yoginī:</b> Mh-hm.<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> <font color="DarkRed">Now She is no more.</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> <font color="DarkRed">But even before Buddha you had a tradition of the Mother Mercy. I do not know how far the Japanese accepted this, but in the eastern part of China and other places they worshiped Mother Mercy, Quānyīn [Guānyīn].<br>
