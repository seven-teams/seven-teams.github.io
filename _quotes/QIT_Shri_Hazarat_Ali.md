<font color="red">"The center known as the Swādhiṣhṭhān chakra, which also controls the aortic plexus outside, is governed by a Deity, which we know very well, is Brahmadeva. And His Power is Saraswatī.<br>
He has incarnated only once on this Earth, and you'll be surprised if I tell you who was that: is Hazarat ʿAlī. He was the son-in-law of Muhammad Sāhab. "</font><br>

<font color="red">"Today the way ... today the way we see Islam, we get frightened. [Gestures to start the translation.]<br>
Specially, these are the days of your marty[rdo]m. And I know about it, everything, what had happened to Hasan and Husayn. You all have done lot of penance for Them, and are still doing it. But now the time has come for all of you to know that Their sacrifice, Their kurbānī, has been completely fulfilled. After all, what did They want? They wanted whatever Their father, ʿAlī, wanted Them to do, also Their mother Fāṭimah. But we don't know, `Who They were? What Incarnations They were? What was Their job?'<br>
......<br>
None of these people came on this Earth to create different groups, none of Them.<br>
It was arf ... unfortunate that the Sunnis came up afterwards, and they never understood ʿAlī. According to Sahaja Yoga, ʿAlī was a very Great Incarnation.<br>
......<br>
We should understand why Muhammad Sāhab and ʿAlī worked so hard for us. What was so? What was so precious about us? They just not care for our mātam [mourning, lamentation, remembrance] but They wanted to make your life shine like a diamond, to make you Agents of the Divine so that you can transform people.<br>
......<br>
This is the experience you must have. I have to tell you the truth. This experience must be felt on your fingertips. And these fingers do not ... dunote [denote] as shown there, the different centers we have. This should happen tonight, tonight, by the grace of Muhammad Sāhab and ʿAlī. I am Their Agent, you can call Me. And that is what is My job: is to give you all you Self-realization.<br>
......<br>
According to Sahaj Yog, ʿAlī was an Incarnation on the second center.<br>
......<br>
Hazarat ʿAlī is the One who is the Incarnation of a Creator, who created the whole universe.<br>
N... now this truth can be proved! This truth can be proved! How? If you are a self-realized person, and your hands are speaking, then if you ask a question, `Was ʿAlī, Hazarat ʿAlī, was the One who created all this universe?', you start getting tremendous Cool Breeze.<br>
......<br>
But now you will know why Muhammad Sāhab and Hazarat ʿAlī came. For what purpose? To let you know what you are. "</font><br>

<font color="red">"Brahmadeva represents that aspect of God Almighty which manifests as the Creator of both the subtle side (esthetics), and of the gross side of material creation. Brahmadeva looks like an ascetic, a saintly personality, with a beard and mustache. He has four heads and all the hair on His heads is tied up in a top-knot. His body is thin with His most prominent feature being bulging and very large eyes. Brahmadeva rarely incarnates but He has incarnated once as Hazarat ʿAlī, husband of Fāṭimah and son-in-law of Muhammad Sāhib. Some ancient Sages tried to explain the meaning of His four heads as the expression of creation into four <i>Vedas</i>. The meaning of His heads is much wider and deeper, though. Brahmadeva is the symbol of the Creative Power of the Supreme, the Īśhwara, Brahma, God. This creative power is expressed through the plane of matter in this universe. All material things have three dimensions but there is a fourth dimension which only human beings can see and feel. This fourth dimension is the esthetic dimension created by balanced harmonies and the integration of different textures, forms and lines. Animals have no sense of beauty; only human beings can feel the esthetics of a composition of different colors, or the movement of lines and the melting of forms. The feelings of joy acquired through this esthetic sense create a <i>Rasa</i> (a secretion of the essence or juice of a feeling). This Rasa gives one a stimulative feeling that sets in motion waves of esthetic joy within the Inner Self. These joys are of different frequencies and vibrations. One does not need to dissect them but as I look at the different petals of this chakra, I shall try to explain the kinds of joys present in the realm of creativity expressed through divine enlightenment.

<font color="red">"Muslims who are not educated enough to understand Qur'ān in original believe that they are the soldiers of Jihād which is led by some very clever ego-oriented educated people. They have not even read the Qur'ān which was edited forty years after the death of Muhammad Sāhib. The editor himself was the most cruel man, who killed Hazarat ʿAlī, His two sons and two other Khalifas. It is said that the mother of this fifth Khalifa ate the raw liver of the fourth Khalifa. In this Jihād, how many Muslims are going to die? On one side they produce more children to create a Muslim majority and on the other side they are getting killed in thousands. The Jihād has become imminent and the Muslims are a real threat to peace and progress of every country they live in."</font><br>
