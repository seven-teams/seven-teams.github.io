<font color="red">"And Hazarat ʿAlī is a very-very Great Incarnation where only once, only once, Brahmadeva has incarnated and He has incarnated as Hazarat ʿAlī.<br>
So, these people are so great! You cannot criticize Them. They are so great: every word that They have spoken is a Mantra. Everything They have told you about this Namāz, which is nothing but Kuṇḍalinī jāgṛuti [awakening].<br>
......<br>
Sahaja Yoga is the integration of all the Truths of Life and I can prove it to you, on the Kuṇḍalinī, that what I say is the fact -- is the fact. Unless and until you take Hazarat ʿAlī's name your Swādhiṣhṭhān chakra cannot be cured, and all the Sahaja Yogis know about it. And in the Sahaja Yogi Pūjā we have to take the name of Muhammad Sāhib again and again and that of Hazarat ʿAlī. And also we have to take the name of Jesus the Lord, who is the āśhraya [refuge, shelter] of all this world, described by Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa in the Bhagavad Gītā -- He was the Mahāviṣhṇu."</font><br>

<font color="red">"That day I did not tell this that Brahmadevjī has taken birth only one time in this world. Only one time. There was a reason for that. And you will get surprised on [My] saying this that was Hazarat ʿAlī, was the son-in-law of Muhammad Sāhab. That is the only Incarnation of Brahmadev in this world. One time only. This is a[n] amazing thing. [<b>Variant:</b> That day I told you that Śhrī Brahmadev took birth only once in this world, only once. There was a reason behind this. And you will be surprised to know that Śhrī Hazarat ʿAlī, who was the son-in-law of Prophet Muhammad, was the only Incarnation of Śhrī Brahmadev on Earth. Only once. This is remarkable.]<br>
People will not accept this saying but you people [please] see in vibrations, then you will understand that I am not telling a lie to you. [<b>Variant:</b> People will not believe this but you can check on vibrations and you will realize that I'm telling the truth.]<br>
Therefore those who have liver, etc. takalīph [problem, difficulty] or have the problem of diabetes because of this chakra, what I told you, due to imbalance, those who are rajoguṇīs [right-sided] people, that problems those [people] get, the treatment of all those problems is taking the name of Hazarat ʿAlī Sāhab. [<b>Variant:</b> Therefore, people who have problems with the liver or are suffering from diabetes because of imbalance, the people who are right-sided and have problems, all such problems can be cured by taking the name of Hazarat ʿAlī Sāhab.]<br>
The problems get removed by this only. It's a matter of great surprise, but it's true [correct, right].<br>
[If] Muslims will accept this then you will not and [if] you māniyegā [will agree (with), accept, honor] Kṛiṣhṇa, then Muslims will not accept. [We] have to be realized (pār) in the world. Though these all reside only in one body, in Virāṭ. [<b>Variant:</b> If Muslims accept this, you will not and if you accept Kṛiṣhṇa they will not. We need to ascend in this world. Although all such people are residing inside the body of Virāṭ.]<br>
They are all connected. Because Hazarat ʿAlī was the son-in-law of Prophet Muhammad and Prophet Muhammad was the Incarnation of King Janaka. His sons Hasan and Husayn, who were killed in the battle of Karbalā, were no one else but Sītājī's sons Lav and Kuśh, who were later incarnated as Mahāvīr and Buddha."</font><br>

If somebody gets a disease of diabetes, he has to take the name of Hazarat ʿAlī to cure it, whether you are Hindu, Muslim, or Parsi. Because His Incarnation is present on this chakra and it gets cured by taking His name only.<br>
We have cured diabetes in Sahaja over almost a hundred percent and the doctors call it as incurable as they will not ask anyone to take Hazarat ʿAlī's name.<br>
They don't even know about these undercurrents, they only know about this is due to the process in which our plexuses work, they see what is outside or gross or what is visible. They only know about it that is solid or gross.<br>
With meditation, you know about your inner being.<br>
And those gurus who know about it, they know that on our left, at the place of Swādhiṣhṭhān, we have to take the name of Hazarat ʿAlī and Fāṭimah."</font><br>

They, of course, they are in a way Muslims, because born in Muslim families, and that they sing the praise of Muhammad, of ʿAlī, of Fāṭimah, of everyone. But they don't consider that the, "We are the only chosen ones."<br>

I must say thank God you are Shias. Because Shia believe in many things which are the truth. One, they believe that you will become a Walī. You have to become a Walī.<br>
We have Hazarat ʿAlī, who was Himself, according to our Sahaja Yoga, He was an Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhab was. We worship Muhammad Sāheb, Hazarat ʿAlī, and Fāṭimah. For us, they are much more than you know in Qur'ān, which, later on you'll find out: how they are related to India.

Not only, He told His wife, that, "You are going to work out," ʿĀ'ishah, He told that, "you are going to work out something against the religion." And really it was wrong on her because His own daughter, as you know Her name was Fāṭimah, stood up and said that, "This, never Muhammad Sāhab has said it."<br>
But this Abū Bakr [father-in-law, the father of ʿĀ'ishah], is a fellow who just took the platform, [laughing:] as it is, I should say, instead of His own son-in-law, Hazarata ʿAlī, who was a great realized Soul. Āṇi [and] he just completely changed uh-uh the ideas about women which Fāṭimah was going to tell.<br>
So there were uh big wars, called Karbalāʾ, in which two children of Fāṭimah Bi were killed, Hazarata ʿAlī was also killed, and there two groups were formed, one is Shia and Sunni.<br>
But Shias, also, don't understand that they have to respect their women, because Fāṭimah Bi Itself [Herself] was a, not only a Saint but an Incarnation, She was a Goddess."</font><br>

That does not mean that spiritual people do not have the protection of the Divine. But it was all done to show how these people could sacrifice Their life [lives] for Truth.<br>
All this is done for us. All these sacrifices are going to help us.<br>
Gradually we'll realize where They exist within our body. If They're enlightened within you, you get Their blessings. You have to have connection with Them.<br>

So for forty years nothing was written.<br>
There was a very stupid man, his name was ... whatever ... this was told to Me by My father. Now it is confirmed that it is true. That person was very devilish and he killed Hazarat ʿAlī and His sons, then he killed the caliph and his mother ate the liver of that Caliph. He was such a horrible man ... he was the enemy of women. He edited the Qur'ān.<br>
Now you tell Me they say Qur'ān ... Qur'ān ... there is no authenticity of Qur'ān.<br>

<b>Version 2:</b><br>
"Yes, Muhammad Sāhab did not write anything at all. He could not even read or write. Poor man, He told fourty people that, "This became known to Me, was a Revelation," like this and that. Those people were also illiterate.<br>
Then for forty years nothing was written.<br>
He was a very wicked man -- his name was Mutawaiya, or something like that. My father told Me about this and now this matter is well-known. That gentleman, a very wicked man, killed Hazarat ʿAlī. Killed His son. And then killed a calipha [caliph]. Then killed another calipha [caliph] and his mother ate his liver. This dirty man, hater of woman, he edited the Qur'ān.<br>
Now what do you say?<br>
They go around with this Qur'ān in their hands. This doesn't have any authenticity.<br>
And even in the Bible, Paul has destroyed everything. At least the Christians believe this. They are Christians for namesake.<br>

<font color="red">"For example, yesterday they were singing about ʿAlī: I was so very happy. Because He was an Incarnation.<br>
And His purity people are singing now, not at that time. He was killed at that time, He was tortured. That always they do. "</font><br>

<font color="red">"Today the way ... today the way we see Islam, we get frightened. [Gestures to start the translation.]<br>
Specially, these are the days of your marty[rdo]m. And I know about it, everything, what had happened to Hasan and Husayn. You all have done lot of penance for Them, and are still doing it. But now the time has come for all of you to know that Their sacrifice, Their kurbānī, has been completely fulfilled. After all, what did They want? They wanted whatever Their father, ʿAlī, wanted Them to do, also Their mother Fāṭimah. But we don't know, 'Who They were? What Incarnations They were? What was Their job?'<br>
......<br>
None of these people came on this Earth to create different groups, none of Them.<br>
It was arf ... unfortunate that the Sunnis came up afterwards, and they never understood ʿAlī. According to Sahaja Yoga, ʿAlī was a very Great Incarnation.<br>
......<br>
We should understand why Muhammad Sāhab and ʿAlī worked so hard for us. What was so? What was so precious about us? They just not care for our mātam [mourning, lamentation, remembrance] but They wanted to make your life shine like a diamond, to make you Agents of the Divine so that you can transform people.<br>
......<br>
This is the experience you must have. I have to tell you the truth. This experience must be felt on your fingertips. And these fingers do not ... dunote [denote] as shown there, the different centers we have. This should happen tonight, tonight, by the grace of Muhammad Sāhab and ʿAlī. I am Their Agent, you can call Me. And that is what is My job: is to give you all you Self-realization.<br>
......<br>
According to Sahaj Yog, ʿAlī was an Incarnation on the second center.<br>
......<br>
Hazarat ʿAlī is the One who is the Incarnation of a Creator, who created the whole universe.<br>
N... now this truth can be proved! This truth can be proved! How? If you are a self-realized person, and your hands are speaking, then if you ask a question, 'Was ʿAlī, Hazarat ʿAlī, was the One who created all this universe?', you start getting tremendous Cool Breeze.<br>
......<br>
But now you will know why Muhammad Sāhab and Hazarat ʿAlī came. For what purpose? To let you know what you are. "</font><br>

<font color="red">"Brahmadeva represents that aspect of God Almighty which manifests as the Creator of both the subtle side (esthetics), and of the gross side of material creation. Brahmadeva looks like an ascetic, a saintly personality, with a beard and mustache. He has four heads and all the hair on His heads is tied up in a top-knot. His body is thin with His most prominent feature being bulging and very large eyes. Brahmadeva rarely incarnates but He has incarnated once as Hazarat ʿAlī, husband of Fāṭimah and son-in-law of Muhammad Sāhib. Some ancient Sages tried to explain the meaning of His four heads as the expression of creation into four <i>Vedas</i>. The meaning of His heads is much wider and deeper, though. Brahmadeva is the symbol of the Creative Power of the Supreme, the Īśhwara, Brahma, God. This creative power is expressed through the plane of matter in this universe. All material things have three dimensions but there is a fourth dimension which only human beings can see and feel. This fourth dimension is the esthetic dimension created by balanced harmonies and the integration of different textures, forms and lines. Animals have no sense of beauty; only human beings can feel the esthetics of a composition of different colors, or the movement of lines and the melting of forms. The feelings of joy acquired through this esthetic sense create a <i>Rasa</i> (a secretion of the essence or juice of a feeling). This Rasa gives one a stimulative feeling that sets in motion waves of esthetic joy within the Inner Self. These joys are of different frequencies and vibrations. One does not need to dissect them but as I look at the different petals of this chakra, I shall try to explain the kinds of joys present in the realm of creativity expressed through divine enlightenment.

<font color="red">"Muslims who are not educated enough to understand Qur'ān in original believe that they are the soldiers of Jihād which is led by some very clever ego-oriented educated people. They have not even read the Qur'ān which was edited forty years after the death of Muhammad Sāhib. The editor himself was the most cruel man, who killed Hazarat ʿAlī, His two sons and two other Khalifas. It is said that the mother of this fifth Khalifa ate the raw liver of the fourth Khalifa. In this Jihād, how many Muslims are going to die? On one side they produce more children to create a Muslim majority and on the other side they are getting killed in thousands. The Jihād has become imminent and the Muslims are a real threat to peace and progress of every country they live in."</font><br>
