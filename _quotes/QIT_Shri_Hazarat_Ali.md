<font color="red">"The center known as the Swādhiṣhṭhān chakra, which also controls the aortic plexus outside, is governed by a Deity, which we know very well, is Brahmadeva. And His Power is Saraswatī.<br>
He has incarnated only once on this Earth, and you'll be surprised if I tell you who was that: is Hazarat ʿAlī. He was the son-in-law of Muhammad Sāhab. "</font><br>

<font color="red">"And Hazarat ʿAlī is a very-very Great Incarnation where only once, only once, Brahmadeva has incarnated and He has incarnated as Hazarat ʿAlī.<br>
So, these people are so great! You cannot criticize Them. They are so great: every word that They have spoken is a Mantra. Everything They have told you about this Namāz, which is nothing but Kuṇḍalinī jāgṛuti [awakening].<br>
......<br>
Sahaja Yoga is the integration of all the Truths of Life and I can prove it to you, on the Kuṇḍalinī, that what I say is the fact -- is the fact. Unless and until you take Hazarat ʿAlī's name your Swādhiṣhṭhān chakra cannot be cured, and all the Sahaja Yogis know about it. And in the Sahaja Yogi Pūjā we have to take the name of Muhammad Sāhib again and again and that of Hazarat ʿAlī. And also we have to take the name of Jesus the Lord, who is the āśhraya [refuge, shelter] of all this world, described by Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa in the Bhagavad Gītā -- He was the Mahāviṣhṇu."</font><br>

You will be surprised to know that He incarnated as Hazarat ʿAlī. You can check it if it is true or not with the help of your vibrations. If somebody gets a disease of diabetes, he has to take the name of Hazarat ʿAlī to cure it, whether you are Hindu, Muslim, or Parsi. Because His Incarnation is present on this chakra and it gets cured by taking His name only.<br>
We have cured diabetes in Sahaja over almost a hundred percent and the doctors call it as incurable as they will not ask anyone to take Hazarat ʿAlī's name.<br>
They don't even know about these undercurrents, they only know about this is due to the process in which our plexuses work, they see what is outside or gross or what is visible. They only know about it that is solid or gross.<br>
With meditation, you know about your inner being.<br>
And those gurus who know about it, they know that on our left, at the place of Swādhiṣhṭhān, we have to take the name of Hazarat ʿAlī and Fāṭimah."</font><br>

And they came to Me, and they just surrendered to Sahaja Yoga. They wanted their Realization, they got their Realization. When their guru came, he also got his Realization, and he said, "This is thing ... Sahaja Yoga which is going to transform the whole world."<br>
They, of course, they are in a way Muslims, because born in Muslim families, and that they sing the praise of Muhammad, of ʿAlī, of Fāṭimah, of everyone. But they don't consider that the, "We are the only chosen ones."<br>
Such beautiful people they were! They got their Realization, "What it is? What about Christ?"<br>

I must say thank God you are Shias. Because Shia believe in many things which are the truth. One, they believe that you will become a Walī. You have to become a Walī.<br>
We have Hazarat ʿAlī, who was Himself, according to our Sahaja Yoga, He was an Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhab was. We worship Muhammad Sāheb, Hazarat ʿAlī, and Fāṭimah. For us, they are much more than you know in Qur'ān, which, later on you'll find out: how they are related to India.

Most of the Saints, even Muhammad Sāhab was tortured. Hazarat ʿAlī who, was a Great Incarnation, also was killed. He ... His two children from Fāṭimah also were killed. Horrible things happened to Them.<br>
That does not mean that spiritual people do not have the protection of the Divine. But it was all done to show how these people could sacrifice Their life [lives] for Truth.<br>
All this is done for us. All these sacrifices are going to help us.<br>
Gradually we'll realize where They exist within our body. If They're enlightened within you, you get Their blessings. You have to have connection with Them.<br>

He was himself a realized Soul. And he had tremendous-s-s respect for Muhammad Sāhsb, for Hazarat ʿAlī, for Fāṭimah, for Hasan, Husayn.<br>

Specially, these are the days of your marty[rdo]m. And I know about it, everything, what had happened to Hasan and Husayn. You all have done lot of penance for Them, and are still doing it. But now the time has come for all of you to know that Their sacrifice, Their kurbānī, has been completely fulfilled. After all, what did They want? They wanted whatever Their father, ʿAlī, wanted Them to do, also Their mother Fāṭimah. But we don't know, 'Who They were? What Incarnations They were? What was Their job?'<br>

None of these people came on this Earth to create different groups, none of Them.<br>
It was arf ... unfortunate that the Sunnis came up afterwards, and they never understood ʿAlī. According to Sahaja Yoga, ʿAlī was a very Great Incarnation.<br>
......<br>
We should understand why Muhammad Sāhab and ʿAlī worked so hard for us. What was so? What was so precious about us? They just not care for our mātam [mourning, lamentation, remembrance] but They wanted to make your life shine like a diamond, to make you Agents of the Divine so that you can transform people.<br>
......<br>
This is the experience you must have. I have to tell you the truth. This experience must be felt on your fingertips. And these fingers do not ... dunote [denote] as shown there, the different centers we have. This should happen tonight, tonight, by the grace of Muhammad Sāhab and ʿAlī. I am Their Agent, you can call Me. And that is what is My job: is to give you all you Self-realization.<br>
......<br>
According to Sahaj Yog, ʿAlī was an Incarnation on the second center.<br>
......<br>
Hazarat ʿAlī is the One who is the Incarnation of a Creator, who created the whole universe.<br>
N... now this truth can be proved! This truth can be proved! How? If you are a self-realized person, and your hands are speaking, then if you ask a question, 'Was ʿAlī, Hazarat ʿAlī, was the One who created all this universe?', you start getting tremendous Cool Breeze.<br>

<font color="red">"Brahmadeva represents that aspect of God Almighty which manifests as the Creator of both the subtle side (esthetics), and of the gross side of material creation. Brahmadeva looks like an ascetic, a saintly personality, with a beard and mustache. He has four heads and all the hair on His heads is tied up in a top-knot. His body is thin with His most prominent feature being bulging and very large eyes. Brahmadeva rarely incarnates but He has incarnated once as Hazarat ʿAlī, husband of Fāṭimah and son-in-law of Muhammad Sāhib. Some ancient Sages tried to explain the meaning of His four heads as the expression of creation into four <i>Vedas</i>. The meaning of His heads is much wider and deeper, though. Brahmadeva is the symbol of the Creative Power of the Supreme, the Īśhwara, Brahma, God. This creative power is expressed through the plane of matter in this universe. All material things have three dimensions but there is a fourth dimension which only human beings can see and feel. This fourth dimension is the esthetic dimension created by balanced harmonies and the integration of different textures, forms and lines. Animals have no sense of beauty; only human beings can feel the esthetics of a composition of different colors, or the movement of lines and the melting of forms. The feelings of joy acquired through this esthetic sense create a <i>Rasa</i> (a secretion of the essence or juice of a feeling). This Rasa gives one a stimulative feeling that sets in motion waves of esthetic joy within the Inner Self. These joys are of different frequencies and vibrations. One does not need to dissect them but as I look at the different petals of this chakra, I shall try to explain the kinds of joys present in the realm of creativity expressed through divine enlightenment.

<font color="red">"Muslims who are not educated enough to understand Qur'ān in original believe that they are the soldiers of Jihād which is led by some very clever ego-oriented educated people. They have not even read the Qur'ān which was edited forty years after the death of Muhammad Sāhib. The editor himself was the most cruel man, who killed Hazarat ʿAlī, His two sons and two other Khalifas. It is said that the mother of this fifth Khalifa ate the raw liver of the fourth Khalifa. In this Jihād, how many Muslims are going to die? On one side they produce more children to create a Muslim majority and on the other side they are getting killed in thousands. The Jihād has become imminent and the Muslims are a real threat to peace and progress of every country they live in."</font><br>
