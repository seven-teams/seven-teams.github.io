The kumkum that I['ll] give, with that draw a line outside the door of your māmā's house; this will be like Lakṣhmaṇ Rekhā</font> [line meant to Śhrī Sītā and protect drawn by Śhrī Lakṣhmaṇa around the dwelling He shares with Śhrī Rāma and Śhrī Sītā at Panchavati in the forest of Dandakaranya, now part of Nasik]<font color="red">. As a result of that your māmī will not be able to throw your māmā out of the house. Otherwise, your māmī will kill your māmā, she is a rākṣhasī."</font><br>

<font color="red">"Śhrī Rāma has many special qualities. He was very powerful and a perfect archer. You might have heard about what He did in Sītā Swayaṃwara.<br>
The same Śhrī Rāma killed the Rāvaṇa when He came to it. Tulasīdās has described His bow very very beautifully. Śhrī Rāma was aiming at Rāvaṇa's head with His arrow. Out of ten head's of Rāvaṇa one will fall down, but again it will assume its place. Lakṣhmaṇa suggested Śhrī Rāma to shoot an arrow in the heart of Rāvaṇa, without which he will not die. "Hit him in the heart." Śhrī Rāma was a very humble person. Though He was very powerful yet hH said to Lakṣhmaṇa that, "Rāvaṇa has placed My Sītā in his heart, therefore, I cannot hit him in the heart. Again and again when I chop off his heads, his attention will be diverted from the heart. Only then shall I shoot him in the heart."<br>
What an example of the love of a husband for His Wife! Ocean of Power, how He was full of love! "</font><br>

<font color="red">"So, at that time, Śhrī Rāma's mother-in-law, I should say, who was the wife of Daśharatha, she said ... she used to s... she's r... like a big uh-uh-uh ... Sādhunī, and she said that: "From today, two marriages are not allowed, only one."<br>
So among Hindus there's only one marriage. They don't have two marriages. And regard it as a very sinful to have another woman, according to Indian culture. There are some people who do it, but is wrong. Is not Indian.<br>
The father-in-law passed the law, because he has, he suffered -- he had two wives. And one of them tried to send Śhrī Rām to the jungle. She was so cruel, because she wanted her son to become the king. And, as it was the mistake of the father, that he had promish... promised that he will give her a boon [twp boons], because she had saved him in war. And so now, she asked him to send Śhrī Rām to the vanavas [vanam], to the-uh jungle. By-ee-eeh second one [boon], she asked to give the kingdom to her son, who was Lakṣhmaṇa.<br>
But when Lakṣhmaṇa came he didn't want. He said, "I don't want to take Śhrī Rāma's ... uah-uah-uah seat because it is his right."<br>
So he went to Śhrī Rām, in the jungle, requested him: "To You must come! You must come to Ayodhyā, to the capital city, and You should be crowned." Śhrī Rām said, "I can't do it. I have to fulfill my father's wish."<br>
But, at that moment,, the father said that,  "In India nobody will have second marriage." Because of two wives the whole family suffered! So, him ... he said, "Only we can have one wife, and no two wives."<br>
Very surprising, that even till today, in India they believe that you should have only one wife.<br>
But uh-uh-uh what you find in another countries, that people may not have another wife, but they have affairs and they do not respect their wives. This is very sad! And the this makes the country suffering. Because if the women are treated like that, the women suffer, and if the mother suffers the children suffer.<br>
So he made a law: that, 'Nobody will marry twice.' "</font><br>

<font color="red">"Later on Śhrī Rāma who was one of the Incarnations on this Earth, showed in his own life that he respected people for their aptitude. For example when Śhrī Rāma was exiled and went to a forest, he met there a poor old woman called Śhabarī who was of tribal caste. She offered some berries to Śhrī Rāma with great affection and devotion. She said: "Please eat them because they are not at all sour. I have already tasted them." The food or fruits tasted by somebody else are not to be eaten (uttiṣhṭa). If someone has bitten off even a part of a fruit, that fruit is no longer pure and cannot be offered to another person, certainly not to an Incarnation. But Śhrī Rāma was greatly moved by the love of the old lady. He accepted the berries with much joy and ate them. He praised their taste and gave some to his wife, Sītā. His brother Lakṣhmaṇ, felt rather jealous and asked for some berries for himself. There are many incidents where Śhrī Rām gets very friendly with people who were not of very high castes. Also his own Rāmāyaṇa, his life story, was written by a fisherman who was a dacoit. This fisherman was transformed into a Saint by another heavenly minstrel called Nārada. Of course an ordinary fisherman who was also a dacoit had such respect for Śhrī Rāma that he wrote this beautiful epic, the Rāmāyaṇa."</font><br>
