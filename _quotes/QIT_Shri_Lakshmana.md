As a result of that your māmī will not be able to throw your māmā out of the house. Otherwise, your māmī will kill your māmā, she is a rākṣhasī."</font><br>

<font color="red">"Secondly, the eyes are very important thing, where you have to be careful not to move your eyes very fast anywhere. Try to keep your eyes steady and mostly on the Mother Earth.<br>
You see, you have heard about Lakṣhmaṇa: He never saw the Feet of Sītājī, never. Or never saw Her face. He only saw Her Feet. How can that be? He was always living with Her, He had never seen Her face! He had just seen His [Her] Feet.<br>
So, you can imagine what should be the position.<br>
And for fourteen years He had to lead a complete brahmachārī's life. He just, She was like His mother. He know [knew] She was Ādi Śhakti, but He just saw Her Feet.<br>
That should be our case, in his thing, that we should lead a sanctified married life. "</font><br>

<b>Version 1:</b><br>
Agni is our Brother-in-law (Dīr). That means Lakṣhmaṇa. They move about in the Form of Śheṣhanāg. But their main task is to protect our modesty. They come up to My Feet and no further."

<b>Version 2:</b><br>
"Agni is My dīra [brother-in-law], means He is Lakṣhmaṇ. He roams around in the Form of Śheṣhanāg. Protecting My chastity is His most important task. He only comes up to My Feet and never beyond it."</font><br>

<font color="red">"The gaze should be kept down to the ground.<br>
We have the example of Lakṣhmaṇa. Sītā was His sister-in-law. Now we do banter and joke with our sister-in-law. Even while talking to Her, He used to look at Her Feet only. Never used to look up. So much respect He must have had.<br>
So the gaze should be at the feet. Do not look in the upward direction. If someone does speak and ask, then look up slowly with great respect and reverence. This movement of the eyes helps in Sahaja Yoga."</font><br>

"So She was married to him [Rāvaṇa].<br>
And when Rāvaṇa, you see, uh-uh-uh s... was fighting Rāma, She was the Satī and She ... She was a de... devotee of Śhrī Viṣhṇu. And She always used to worship Śhrī Viṣhṇu.<br>
So She threw Her kaṅkaṇ [bracelet of thread used in Pūjās] -- this is the kaṅkaṇ. It's call as kaṅkaṇ, you see. See this one?<br>
[After a Sahaja Yogi says something:] [<font color="orange">unclear</font>]. See now.<br>
[After a Sahaja Yogi says something:] Very interesting, very interesting.<br>
[After a Sahaja Yogi says, "Mh-hm,":] Kaṅkaṇ.<br>
[After a Sahaja Yogi says, "Mh,":] You see, not easy to make.<br>
[After a Sahaja Yogi says, "Yeah.":] [<font color="orange">unclear</font>].<br>
[After two Sahaja Yogis say something:] You see.<br>
Be careful, [<font color="orange">unclear</font>].<br>
[<font color="orange">unclear</font>].<br>
[After a Sahaja Yogi says something:] You see? You see, she came out.<br>
So, all these ... uh ... this kaṅkaṇ, you know, She threw it in the air. And Rāma's ... ah-ah-uh arrows were coming, and they would return back to Rāma.<br> 
Because Rāma cannot cross beyond the Powers of a Satī also. He has to respect her [a Satī in general].<br>
Because She was the devotee of Rāma, first of all, and of which, you know, that Kālī is the sister of a ... Umā is the sister of ...<br>
[After a Sahaja Yogi says, "Viṣhṇu,":] ... Viṣhṇu. So, you see, how can He kill the whuh ... husband of ...<br>
[After a Sahaja Yogi interrupts, "Sister":] ... the sister?<br>
You see, all of these points are there.<br>
And the kaṅkaṇa was in the air, is projective. Everything failed. You see, nothing would go, even Sudarśhan Chakra wouldn't go that side.<br>
[After a Sahaja Yogi says, "Mh,":] So, Lakṣhmaṇa said, "What are you doing‽ What is it? You are getting back your, all your arrows! Why don't you control your arrows? You see what to do. See there, what is there." He saw this kaṅkaṇa was moving there. He said, "Oh, God! Now, you have it. If this is the thing to work out, then am I useless?" Poor Lakṣhmaṇa was sitting very much in frustration.<br>
Then Yama, the God of Death, he thought: "The time is coming and what is this kaṅkaṇ doing here? You see, so must try to solve this problem." [Sahaja Yogi laughs.]<br>
So, He is the clever one.<br>
He ... he went into the heart of ... uh-uh-uh or He went into the mind of Rāvaṇa, and told him: "Oh, you are not uh the one who is winning the war, it is your wife's anger." And, oh, his ego was challenged. [During laughter:] [<font color="orange">unclear</font>], "Kaṅkaṇ [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] you see in the air, you see that [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] is there. That is the one that is protecting you." Very angry: "What does She mean by challenging my manliness?"<br>
See, so he went down to his palace.<br>
And he saw She ... She was sitting there smiling. She said: "I know you will come back." He said: "What do You mean? I cannot fight the war? You think I live by Your powers? Will You please get ... get back your kaṅkaṇa? It's my order!"<br>
So, as a Satī you have to obey the orders of your husband, you see.<br>
[After a Sahaja Yogi says, "Mh,":]  She said, "All right. I will take it back." She took [it] back, you see.<br>
So, [as the Sahaja Yogi laughs:] but you can find out loopholes, you see. That is, that's the [<font color="orange">unclear</font>]. [Everyone laughs.]<br> 
So, She said, "Now, I've taken back My kaṅkaṇ." All right. Then She sat before Viṣhṇu. She said, "How dare You kill My husband? I will not eat food till he comes back here alive, I will not eat."<br>
Now, Viṣhṇu had a problem. Now what to do? He cannot kill, Rāma being Viṣhṇu, you see. [Another Sahaja Yogi laughs.] He cannot kill Rāvaṇa. Now He said, "What to do?" So He told Lakṣhmaṇa: "It's a big problem!"<br>
So Lakṣhmaṇa informed Yama: "Again the problem has come [same Sahaja Yogi laughs]: She won't eat food till [he laughs again] ... Rā-ah ... Her husband goes back, you know." So Yama said, "I know it's very dangerous, but I have to try this trick otherwise I'm in for trouble. This man has to die, for the time has come." So, Yama said, "It's a very big risk of ... to say this to Satī."<br>
You see: one woman fighting all this [he laughs again], with Her will Power.<br>
"It's all right." He says, "All right. I will manage it."<br>
He took the form of a ... of Rāvaṇa himself. He became, took, started looking like Rāvaṇa.<br>
And He went there, and He stood up in the door. And he said: "Now, see, I have come now." [She] said: "Did you win the war?" She [he] said, "Yes!" She said, "All right." "Now, will You eat Your food?" And the food was lying before Her. And She made a mistake there: She ate the food.<br>
Before your husband has taken the food you are not supposed to eat your food. You see, that's why Indian women will never eat it. [Sahaja Yogi laughs.] Because this gives them power, you see. To be [a] dedicated wife means power.<br>
So, they do not mind, even if their husbands are bad, even if they are rākṣhasas, they are anything: they will be dedicated to their husbands. They'll love them. So that they keep their own powers, and by that they save their husbands' also.<br>
So he stood up there, and [<font color="orange">unclear</font>], "You eat Your food."<br>
As soon as She ate the food, you see, uh not even She ate the first morsel, Rāvaṇa's head was cut. And the head fell at the feet of a ...<br>
[After a Sahaja Yogi says, "Mh-hm,":] ... Mandodarī.<br>
And then, you know, he, Yama came in his own form. And She cursed him that, "You will be a dog in the next life." And He became a dog, in the next life. He has to become that.<br>
So they are so powerful.<br>
But this I'm telling you about someone who was uh uh sort of a Sahaja Sāmarthya [Spontaneous Power], [<font color="orange">unclear</font>].<br>
[After a Sahaja Yogi interrupts, "Which dog was this, Mother?":] Hah?<br>
[After the Sahaja Yogi says, "Which dog? This wasn't the dog which accompanied Yudhiṣhṭhira,":] Of course!<br>
[Overlapping with a Sahaja Yogi]: Who else?<br>
Yes!<br>
[After a Sahaja Yogi laughs and says, "That's the Yudhiṣhṭhira who released Yama from this,":] You see, actually, it is uh, Rāv... after Rāma, you see, whatever curses and everything went carried on during the time of Kṛiṣhṇa.<br> 
[After a Sahaja Yogi says, "Acchā,":] So he is the same dog!<br>
[After a Sahaja Yogi says, "Mh,":]  The one who followed Yudhiṣhṭhira, you see.<br>
[After a Sahaja Yogi says, "Mh-hm,":] Near ... Dharmarāja means ...<br>
<font color="red">So, this uh ... this story, She ... tells you about Mandodarī, who was of's Kālī, Umā, She was Pārvatī Śhakti, so is different.</font>"<br>

<font color="red">Now, you all should understand that when we talk about religion then it is more within than external.<br>
There are many examples for it. You can take example of Śhrī Rāma. There was an old lady without teeth, living in jungle, without taking bath. She brought the berries for Śhrī Rāma by tasting it that if they are sweet or sour and offered them to Śhrī Rāma. In Maharashtra they are very particular about this that they will not eat of it is eaten by others. Will you eat those berries? But Śhrī Rāma enjoyed them with love! He told to Sītā that, "I will not give you even one, I will eat them all. I never got such taste ever." Then that old lady said that I have more and they are broken by my teeth. Lakṣhmaṇa became very angry seeing all this. Then Sītājī said that, "It is true that even I have not tasted such berries ever in My life. Give Me more and also to My brother-in-law." It is described so beautifully." "</font><br>

<p>
<font color="red">"There are two nice stories about giving: is one about Rāma and one about Kṛiṣhṇa.<br>
But uh I don't know if I have told you about Rāma stories when the Śhabarī, an old aboriginal woman, who was there and she gave ... is a kind of a fruit [ber -- ziziphus mauritiana] like berries, after testing them with her teeth, to Rām. Every, every fruit she took out, tested it nicely. I mean, ate them, in the sense that she pierced them with her teeth to see [if] they were sour or not. And then they kept them collected in a bunch, I mean in a basket.<br>
And when He came, you see, she took them to Rāma.<br>
And she said to Him, you see -- I mean first she talked to all the leaves and all the trees and everyone that, 'Give me the best fruits, all right? He's coming now. And I've adored Him, I have prayed for Him, now He's coming, so you give me the best fruit.' And then she collected all those things. And she was waiting for Him to come.<br>
When He came, she washed His Feet and made Him sit down. And then she offered this fruit. She said,:"Every fruit I have tested! So, You can eat all of them, because they are not at all sour." Oh Rāma took that immediately. he tarted eating: "What a nice thing! Really I've never eaten such good fruits! Never in My life I have had such good fruits! What taste! Immense... Immensely delicious!" And Lakṣhmaṇa, the brother, was getting very angry with her, that, 'What is this?'
In ... in India it is regarded [as] uttishtha [forbidden]. You see, [if] somebody has eaten something, except for [when] that person is a Saint you are not supposed to eat that.<br>
And this lady [laughing:] had done all that, to eating and [<font color="orange">unclear</font>]. And He was enjoying it!<br>
So, He told His wife, Sītā, He said: "Oh, I cannot give You anything out of this. If You want to have more You should ask her to get some more. But I will never share anything!" So, Sītā says, "No-no-no-no. Little bit let Me also enjoy. What is this? You are going to enjoy everything, is not good. After all I am Your ardhāṅgini [principal half], I am Your half  ... half-personality so You cannot eat the whole. You have to give Me little bit." Then She took some. And She started [<font color="orange">unclear</font>]. She tells Her brother-in-law, She says, you see, "I've never eaten really such nice fruits! But I'm not going to give You anything! Even if You ask for it, I sm not going to give You. You can ask Your brother." His brother said, "No! I've shared with You but why should I share with Him? You can share with Him, why should I share?" [Laughter.] "This is so great!"<br>
You see?<br>
And She was praising and praising. Then Lakṣhmaṇ said, "All right, let Me also have a little." [Some laughter.] So She says, "All right! I will give You only few." Rāma said, "All right, first You give, then I will see how much I can give." So She counted and gave Him. He ate. He said, "Really, there's something. Something I don't know, it's like Amṛut Phal."<br>
Amṛut Phal means a ... Amṛut is uh-uh-uh ... the Fruit of Nectar, you see,. <br>
"I just cannot imagine what a taste is!" He asked Rāma, "After all, You cannot be that selfish. You are My elder brother, You have to share Your things with Me. Better give Me some."<br>
And they started, you see, quarreling about it. [It] is such a beautiful description in the Rāmāyaṇa, of Śhabarī ... 'Śhabarī ke ber', 'The ... The bers of Śhabarī'.<br>
This is one of the thing[s] [stories]."</font><br>

<font color="red">"You know the story of Śhabarī. She was a very simple woman, an old lady with very few teeth.<br>
When Rāma was coming, she said, "What should I give to Śhrī Rām?"<br>
All right, she went round and round. There were, in the forest, some small, little what we call berries, ber, and she thought, 'It may not be sweet for my Rām. How will I give Him?" So, she picked them up, she used to test them with her teeth. One tooth she used to pierce in it and see if it is sweet. And then she would collect those. And those who were bad she threw away.<br>
When Śhrī Rām came, she said, "Śhrī Rām, I couldn't get anything but these for You. Will You have it?"<br>
Now, Śhrī Rāma, being an Incarnation, knew the depth of the love of this lady. He took it up in His hand. He knew that this is given by great love of a great heart.<br>
So, she says: "This I have tested each one of them. Don't have any doubts. I have tested in every one of them, they are all very sweet. You can have them." So: He puts it in the mouth, tells His wife, "I have never eaten such beautiful fruits, such great fruits, before."<br>
I mean, it's such a simple fruit, you see.<br>
Sītājī, His wife, being an Incarnation Herself, She said: "You must give Me some. After all, I am Your ardhāṅgi[ni]."<br>
Is a half, better half. [Laughter.]<br>
But Lakṣhmaṇa was getting angry. He said, "Who is this old woman sitting here and giving such?"<br>
Uh-uh-uh we, we don't eat things, you see, eaten by others. We call it tustha, is a uttiṣhṭa, means, if the one who has eaten something is never given. And to Rāma?<br>
So, He get, was very angry, fuming with temper. So She takes it in Her hand, and She tells Her brother-in-law: "Oh, this is the best I've had, oh my brother-in-law. I have never had such beautiful fruits." Now He gets tempted. And He says: "Really? [Laughter.] Can I have some?" She said, "No! It's only for Me and My husband! [Laughter.] You better ask her." So She asks-s-s ... He asks Śhabarī, "Can you give Me some, please?" The whole temper fizzles out. And then He sees the beauty of that fruit because it is done with love.<br>
So this is what it is: love which you have should be expanded."</font><br>

<font color="red">"Now, you have to notice on the streets of Maharashtra -- just now I was coming by train -- I saw no mens [men], there were [was] nobody who were interested in women, no women were interested in men, some men were hugging each other, walking around vmore ery innocently. I mean, the whole thing was that life-ph-ph is innocence.<br>
And that is what it was here when this rākṣhasa's wi... sister, Śhūrpaṇakhā.Mbr>
So nowadays if there is any woman in India who behaves like that, tries to entice men, is called as Śhūrpaṇakhā.<br>
So this woman came and tried to entice Śhrī Rāma.<br>
Imagine! What audacity! [Some laughter.]<br>
So Śhrī Rāma being saṅkochī, means He was a man full of grace, He told her, "See now, what's the use of running after Me? I have already got a beautiful wife. So why do you run after Me? Better try My brother who has no wife."<br>
Because He knew Him [laughter, laughs]. Becuase He knew that His brother is a ... Śheṣhanāga, 'He is the serpent on which ... very big serpent called Śheṣhanāg, Śheṣha. And He is a hot tempered fellow, and He will just know how to deal with this woman, I can't manage this show.' Because He would not ill-treat a woman! It was too much for Him. Though, she was Śhūrpaṇakhā, and not only that, but she was also a woman.<br>
So-o-o, when He went ... No! He ... He asked her: that, "You go and see Him."<br>
Lakṣhmaṇa was sitting outside.<br>
Lakṣhmaṇa had taken a vow to be a brahmachārī, elibate man, with fourteen years penance. Though He was a married man. This He had to do for that's the only way He could kill another demon, whose name was Meghanād, who had run away with His daughter, called as Sulochanā. It's a long story. [Laughter.]<br>
So make it short, this fellow went to this brahmachārī, Lakṣhmaṇa, though He had a wife in Ayodhyā, who is leading a life of a brahmachārī.<br>
Is very common in India. I mean if your wife is away, you just think about her, and you are in separation, still you enjoy your wife thinking about her! And thinking about the good things she has done to you.<br>
But if she has done all the time bad things you don't want to think about her [laughter], and then all these demonic things start."</font><br>

<div class="para-divider"></div>

<p>
<font color="red">"So now, we have here one of the most ancient places, called Nasik.<br>
I think you must have heard about what happened when Śhrī Rāma and Sītā were staying here, why this place was called as Nasik. But I'll tell you in short.<br>
This is the place where Śhrī Rāma and Sītā and Lakṣhmaṇa were staying, and the sister of Rāvaṇa, because Rāvaṇa's some of the empires, a part of the empire was very close to this place. She came down to entice Śhrī Rāma. So Śhrī Rāma smiled at her. He said that: "Is not possible with Me because I have a very nice wife," in His own sweet ways, as He is known for His ... uh-uh-uh ... formal's, formal is not the word but for He's sweet formalities, as we call saṅkocha. He said, "You better try your hand at My brother," because He knew His brother is a terrific fellow. [Laughter, laughs.]<br>
So, this, this is all rākṣhasī: is a quality of rākṣhasas. That the women who are rākṣhasinis try to entice men. Men who are rākṣhasas tries [try[]] to entice woman. Is a quality of rākṣhasas, not of human beings. And of course not of Devas.<br>
So this rākṣhasini wanted to try her luck. With her ego she went down to Lakṣhmaṇa, and she told Him that: "You are now ... uh-uh-uh living without Your wife for fourteen years, and the this fourteen years are going to be very heavy for You, so, I think You better marry me. I am a good lady, why don't You marry me? Sss-so-o-o, He, she said, "I have got a beautiful nose, I have got beautiful eyes, I am very beautiful," [laughter starts, smiles] ...<br>
Ah-ah-oah must be artificial, I'm sure. [Laughter, laughs.] Or might have been to some sort of a Beauty Parlor or something [as luaghter starts, laughing:] is there. [Laughs.]<br>
God knows what she must have tried, but she was trying to impress.<br>
And the fellow was getting infuriated at it. He could not see, you see that, 'Look at this lady coming and trying to challenge My chastity.' And He got ultimately very angry. He told her, "You get out from here. I have nothing to do with you. You are useless. Don't try all these tricks with Me." But she would not go. She was so enchanted by Him and she, her ego was hurt. She said, "Now, this not." Not to accept any defeat. She went on.<br>
Then He got very angry and He cut her nose, of which she was very proud that, "I have [a] beautiful nose." He cut her nose.<br>
And nose represents ego. See when people have ego, you see, their noses go like that. [Laughter, laughs.]<br>
Like we have, you must have seen when while coming from Lonavala, they said, "Duke's nose." Because such a big nose they start, must, it cannot be any Englishman's nose. It must be the Duke of some place, otherwise cannot be such a big nose, you see. So the Indians call it as, 'Duke's nose'.<br>
So, the big nose, such a big nose she had. So He cut her nose, showing that: He tried to destroy her ego of her beauty.<br>
Is very significant. Very significant that ... this Lakṣhmaṇa resides in the stomach, we can say, on the right side. He looks after our right side which is the liver, which gives us the ego part. And it is He only who destroys it. So He is the big destroyer of our ego. Is significant, that He destroyed the ego of this woman [Śhūrpaṇakhā]. That she could [not anymore] endi... entice anyone by cutting her nose.<br>
Nose is a word call nāsikā in Sanskrit language. That's why this place was named, after that cutting of the nose, as Nasik."<br>
......<br>
And that is the thing in a place like this where Sītā had to suffer so much, where uh-uh ... Lakṣhmaṇa had to do all these ugly things. It was a terrible thing that happened in Nasik.<br>
And then, if you get in that background, like in a drama, you see, you show a climax and then an anticlimax like that, yesterday I felt that the drama is complete now. I was really very much satisfied with what happened last night: the oneness with which we sang, the oneness we felt, and the oneness we had about ourselves.<br>
We are Universal Beings! We do not belong to any country. We do not belong to any caste, community or so-called religions. We are all universal people. We have no such bondages, which keep us separate from each other.<br>
All this love, all this affection. and all this is going to transform this horrible world into the right path, into the righteous path, into the path of benevolence.<br>
So Nasik has done something good to Me.<br>
Last time I had tears in My ... eyes and you have taken a Photograph of this Sāndra Karuṇā. And today I have got the feeling of great joy within Myself.<br>
May God bless you all!<br>
Thank you!</font><br>

<font color="red">"As you know about the old lady Śhabarī, she collected some berries and tasted each one of them with teeth. When Rāma came, she said, "Please eat, because You don't like sour things. I have tasted all of them, and the sweet ones I have kept for You." But Lakṣhmaṇa, who was the other kind, was very angry, that, 'How dare this low caste woman offer Rāma in such a manner!' Whereas Śhrī Rāma had tears in His eyes and started eating and said, "I have never eaten such tasty and sweet berries." Sītājī understood the whole thing and said, "May I have some?" When Sītājī ate them She described them as Amṛuta. Then Lakṣhmaṇa asked for some but Sītājī said, "No, you can't have any as You were so angry." After pleading with, He also ate some and found them sweet.<br>

And the discrimination in this is that, 'That, Śhrī ... if Śhrī Rāma has asked for, whatever He asked for I'll do it.'<br>
So, is a relationship of a, I would say, like a guru and śhiṣhya. But even more than that: that the śhiṣhya is just like a sssss... subservient servant, absolutely surrendered to God. Absolutely surrendered to God.<br>

<font color="red">"So the Love of God Almighty you already know, you have the knowledge. And whatever you wish to know you can know. Wherever He turns His attention, the attention will know what it is. He knows all this on your chakras, and also He knows how to correct these chakras. And the procedure is so beautiful, gentle and delicate, that to understand it we should have a heart. Unless we have a heart, we cannot understand that action of the Paramātma.<br>
Like the berries of Śhabarī. Śhabarī belonged to a simple class called Bhīls. Bhīls are among the lowest strata of the caste system. She was old, and her teeth were missing. She just had about three or four teeth in her mouth. When Śhrī Rām came to that area, she collected some berries, and pierced each one with her teeth, to taste if they were sweet, because she could not offer sour fruits to Him. That is why she selected each one carefully.<br>
When she offered them to Śhrī Rām, He got a glimpse of her love in it. He knew. He recognized that this was an offering of love. He accepted the whole lot, and began to eat them, one by one. He said, "I have never eaten such tasty berries before. They are pure Amṛut. His wife, who was verily the Devī, saw this and said, "Really? Then give Me also some." He said, "No! I am not giving any to anyone. These are for Me." Just see the mirth. Such a way of expressing His love. His wife said, "Look. I am Your other half, and You will have to share half with Me!" In the name of dharma He agreed, and gave Her some. Just two or three. Not more. She ate them, and She said, "What wonderful berries these are! I have never eaten this kind before."<br>
Normally, no one eats something that has been half eaten by someone else. But the half-eaten berries of this tribal woman, were eaten by both of Them. Lakṣhmaṇ was reacting, and got angry. He thought, 'What discourteous behavior is this! Such a great Incarnation is standing before us, and this woman has come with her half-eaten berries, and is actually feeding it to Him! And They seem to be eating and enjoying them.' And He got into a temper.<br>
But when Sītājī exclaimed that She had never eaten such tasty berries, He got a little tempted. He pleaded, "Please give me also a few. Please give." She said, "No. I will not give." Then He said, "All right, please forgive me. But please give me a few." So, Sītājī relented, and gave Him two or three. No sooner He ate the berries, His anger came down. He became absolutely cool.<br>
So in which way this loving banter, these waves of love, these small, small things are used by Paramātma to raise the level of a human being. It is only by these waves of love that a human being can be raised by Paramātma. This is how He tries to raise them. No other. Only God knows the different ways of setting right human beings."</font><br>

[After the trsnslator says, "Yes," and translates:] Her name was Śhabarī.<br>

So, when she started putting this ber into the mouth of Śhrī Rāma, He was getting even worse. So, she said: "See how carefully I have uh done this testing, and you are enjoying. Ah, otherwise You would not have enjoyed them." And here, Shrī ... Lakṣhmaṇa was getting angry, very angry. So, Śh... Śhrī Rāma says: "Oh! What wonderful fruits! I have never eaten such fruits in My lifetime!" So, His wife Sītā, she said, "Why don't You give Me some?" He said, "No, no! These are for Me! I can't give You." So Sītājī said that: "After all, I am uh-uh-uh He... Your wife, and You have to share everything with Me." He said, "All right. As a matter of right I am giving You." So He gave those ber, those fruits, to Her. So Sītā said, "What? This is just like Ambros[i]a. Such beautiful fruits I have never eaten!" So She tells Her brother-in-law: "See, what fruits! These are heavenly fruits!" So He got tempted. So, Lakṣhmaṇa said: "Give Me some to taste also." So, Sītājī said: "No-no-no-no! I am not going to share. Uh after all, I have got it with great difficulty from Your mother [brother], I am not going to share." So, Śhrī Rāma said, "All right. Give Her ... give Him something, [<font color="orange">unclear</font> it's all right]." So this innocent old lady says: "No, I have some more! I can give Him. You can have Your share.

<font color="red">"To uphold the maryādās of the throne He renounced Śhrī Sītājī (who was very dear to Him), simply because people doubted Her despite her crossing the fire (Agni Parīkṣhā). Śhrī Sītājī Herself also left Śhrī Rāma, in a way in the end after bringing up Her children nicely; who had acquired all vidyās and had mastered the Art of Archery, so much so that they defeated their own uncle Śhrī Lakṣhmaṇa and ultimately Śhrī Rāma had to come to fight with them to free the horse of 'Aśhvamedh Yagñya'. But Śhrī Sītājī who stood on 'dharma', intervened and averted the fight between the father and the sons."</font><br>

<font color="red">"So, the third, bhakti part, also comes after Self-realization.<br>
Now in the bhakti, you see, there is no ... 'What is the value is?', and, 'How much you paid for it?', and, 'How you bought it?', is not important.<br>
For that an a great example is of Śhrī Rāma when He ... He went in the jungles. There was a[n] old lady from the scheduled's class, means she was uh-uh-uh ... one of the Bhilini [Bhilni] as they call it a -- these people live in the jungles. So she brought some berries, and offered it to Śhrī Rām. And she said that: "I have tasted all of them, and they are not sour. All of them I have tasted."<br>
Now, after tasting something in India, people call it, it's a ... become not to be eaten. I mean a ... we cannot eat ... taste something and give it to somebody else. Is not done, according to Indian culture.<br>
But Śhrī Rāma took it. He took it, He said, "What? Beautiful fruits, I've never eaten such fruit!" So, Lakṣhmaṇa got very angry! He said, "You, stupid woman, you have eaten these fruits and that's what you are giving to Śhrī Rām! Why did [you] do that?" So, Sītā was watching. So she asked Him, "Why don't you give Me some of these fruits?" He gave. She said, "My God! What nice fruits these are! I have never eaten such good fruits." So then Lakṣhmaṇa also His temper came down, and He said: "Can You not give Me some?" She said, "Why? You were so angry, why should I give You?" So ultimately, She gaves [gives] Him that fruit.<br>
So what did He see in those fruits? Was the love: the love of this old lady living in the forest, her love which was important."</font><br>

<font color="red">"When He went into the village, and He found there was an old woman. And this old woman had all her teeth out practically. And she was from the aboriginal. And sheenk [she] gave Him some ... uh-uh-uh ... we call them ber, is something like uh-uh ...<br>
......
Is a ... kind of a fruit, small fruits.<br>
And the ... she said, "See, I have tasted all of them. And all of them are very sweet, because You should not have something which is not sweet. So I have tasted them with my tooth: I have put my tooth on to them and I have tasted it. So please have them."<br>
Immediately He took it. But His brother Lakṣhmaṇa got very angry, that it's very inauspicious in India, if you have put something in the mouth, and then you want to give to somebody is something uttiṣhṭa, is not to be done. Ha-ha-ha but Śhrī Rāma said: "I've never eaten such beautiful fruits. They are the most beautiful fruits I have eaten." So His wife says: "Also give Me some after all. I am Your half this thing, You must give Me." So Śhrī Rāma gave Her some. She said, "Wow! What a thing it is! Is tremendous!" She ate it! And then the Lakṣhmaṇa says: "Give Me also, sister-in-law." She said, "Just now You were saying all kinds of things against this lady, why do you want to have it?" He said, "Now please forgive Me, give Me."<br>
So, see, it shows that Śhrī Rāma could see her love, her vibrations in those fruits that she had offered. And He could appreciate to that extent that He gave it to His wife and the wife also joined hands with Him.<br>
This is what it is: that whatever you do, you do it with love. If you do it with love, you will be able to make it auspicious.<br>
But if there's no love, you are just doing for some purpose, then it is useless.<br>
So this is what is there for giving.<br>
Giving to the ... person like Śhrī Rām, and to such a Great Incarnation, she just thought of her love, and she gave it to Him.<br>
In the same way, you have to be very simple, simple-hearted, and then you will know what is the best to be done."</font><br>

<font color="red">"Śhrī Rāma has many special qualities. He was very powerful and a perfect archer. You might have heard about what He did in Sītā Swayaṃwara.<br>
The same Śhrī Rāma killed the Rāvaṇa when He came to it. Tulasīdās has described His bow very very beautifully. Śhrī Rāma was aiming at Rāvaṇa's head with His arrow. Out of ten head's of Rāvaṇa one will fall down, but again it will assume its place. Lakṣhmaṇa suggested Śhrī Rāma to shoot an arrow in the heart of Rāvaṇa, without which he will not die. "Hit him in the heart." Śhrī Rāma was a very humble person. Though He was very powerful yet hH said to Lakṣhmaṇa that, "Rāvaṇa has placed My Sītā in his heart, therefore, I cannot hit him in the heart. Again and again when I chop off his heads, his attention will be diverted from the heart. Only then shall I shoot him in the heart."<br>
What an example of the love of a husband for His Wife! Ocean of Power, how He was full of love! "</font><br>

<font color="red">"So, at that time, Śhrī Rāma's mother-in-law, I should say, who was the wife of Daśharatha, she said ... she used to s... she's r... like a big uh-uh-uh ... Sādhunī, and she said that: "From today, two marriages are not allowed, only one."<br>
So among Hindus there's only one marriage. They don't have two marriages. And regard it as a very sinful to have another woman, according to Indian culture. There are some people who do it, but is wrong. Is not Indian.<br>
The father-in-law passed the law, because he has, he suffered -- he had two wives. And one of them tried to send Śhrī Rām to the jungle. She was so cruel, because she wanted her son to become the king. And, as it was the mistake of the father, that he had promish... promised that he will give her a boon [twp boons], because she had saved him in war. And so now, she asked him to send Śhrī Rām to the vanavas [vanam], to the-uh jungle. By-ee-eeh second one [boon], she asked to give the kingdom to her son, who was Lakṣhmaṇa.<br>
But when Lakṣhmaṇa came he didn't want. He said, "I don't want to take Śhrī Rāma's ... uah-uah-uah seat because it is his right."<br>
So he went to Śhrī Rām, in the jungle, requested him: "To You must come! You must come to Ayodhyā, to the capital city, and You should be crowned." Śhrī Rām said, "I can't do it. I have to fulfill my father's wish."<br>
But, at that moment,, the father said that,  "In India nobody will have second marriage." Because of two wives the whole family suffered! So, him ... he said, "Only we can have one wife, and no two wives."<br>
Very surprising, that even till today, in India they believe that you should have only one wife.<br>
But uh-uh-uh what you find in another countries, that people may not have another wife, but they have affairs and they do not respect their wives. This is very sad! And the this makes the country suffering. Because if the women are treated like that, the women suffer, and if the mother suffers the children suffer.<br>
So he made a law: that, 'Nobody will marry twice.' "</font><br>

<font color="red">"Later on Śhrī Rāma who was one of the Incarnations on this Earth, showed in his own life that he respected people for their aptitude. For example when Śhrī Rāma was exiled and went to a forest, he met there a poor old woman called Śhabarī who was of tribal caste. She offered some berries to Śhrī Rāma with great affection and devotion. She said: "Please eat them because they are not at all sour. I have already tasted them." The food or fruits tasted by somebody else are not to be eaten (uttiṣhṭa). If someone has bitten off even a part of a fruit, that fruit is no longer pure and cannot be offered to another person, certainly not to an Incarnation. But Śhrī Rāma was greatly moved by the love of the old lady. He accepted the berries with much joy and ate them. He praised their taste and gave some to his wife, Sītā. His brother Lakṣhmaṇ, felt rather jealous and asked for some berries for himself. There are many incidents where Śhrī Rām gets very friendly with people who were not of very high castes. Also his own Rāmāyaṇa, his life story, was written by a fisherman who was a dacoit. This fisherman was transformed into a Saint by another heavenly minstrel called Nārada. Of course an ordinary fisherman who was also a dacoit had such respect for Śhrī Rāma that he wrote this beautiful epic, the Rāmāyaṇa."</font><br>
