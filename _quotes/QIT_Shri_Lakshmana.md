<b>Version 1:</b><br>
Agni is our Brother-in-law (Dīr). That means Lakṣhmaṇa. They move about in the Form of Śheṣhanāg. But their main task is to protect our modesty. They come up to My Feet and no further."

"Agni is My dīra [brother-in-law], means He is Lakṣhmaṇ. He roams around in the Form of Śheṣhanāg. Protecting My chastity is His most important task. He only comes up to My Feet and never beyond it."</font><br>

<font color="red">"The gaze should be kept down to the ground.<br>
We have the example of Lakṣhmaṇa. Sītā was His sister-in-law. Now we do banter and joke with our sister-in-law. Even while talking to Her, He used to look at Her Feet only. Never used to look up. So much respect He must have had.<br>
So the gaze should be at the feet. Do not look in the upward direction. If someone does speak and ask, then look up slowly with great respect and reverence. This movement of the eyes helps in Sahaja Yoga."</font><br>

<font color="red">Now, you all should understand that when we talk about religion then it is more within than external.<br>
There are many examples for it. You can take example of Śhrī Rāma. There was an old lady without teeth, living in jungle, without taking bath. She brought the berries for Śhrī Rāma by tasting it that if they are sweet or sour and offered them to Śhrī Rāma. In Maharashtra they are very particular about this that they will not eat of it is eaten by others. Will you eat those berries? But Śhrī Rāma enjoyed them with love! He told to Sītā that, "I will not give you even one, I will eat them all. I never got such taste ever." Then that old lady said that I have more and they are broken by my teeth. Lakṣhmaṇa became very angry seeing all this. Then Sītājī said that, "It is true that even I have not tasted such berries ever in My life. Give Me more and also to My brother-in-law." It is described so beautifully." "</font><br>

Now they show the two sides of a human being.<br>
One was Lakṣhmaṇa, and he was that fiery type, you see. He couldn't bear anybody misbehaving towards Rāma. He couldn't bear anybody talking in a very mundane type to Śhrī Rāma. And he used to get so angry with all these people, that he would just come out like a big thunderbolt on anybody who tried to say anything about Śhrī Rām.<br>

I have never eaten such berries in life." Trusting His sister-in-law, He tried one and He found it heavenly.

<font color="red">"You know the story of Śhabarī. She was a very simple woman, an old lady with very few teeth. When Rāma was coming, she said, "What should I give to Śhrī Rām?" All right, she went round and round. There were, in the forest, some small, little what we call berries, ber, and she thought, 'It may not be sweet for my Rām. How will I give Him?" So, she picked them up, she used to test them with her teeth. One tooth she used to pierce in it and see if it is sweet. And then she would collect those and those who were bad she threw away.<br>
When Śhrī Rām came, she said, "Śhrī Rām, I couldn't get anything but these for You. Will You have it?" Now, Śhrī Rāma, being an Incarnation, knew the depth of the love of this lady. He took it up in His hand. He knew that this is given by great love of a great heart. So, she says: "This I have tested each one of them. Don't have any doubts. I have tested in every one of them, they are all very sweet. You can have them." So: He puts it in the mouth, tells His wife, "I have never eaten such beautiful fruits, such great fruits before." I mean, it's such a simple fruit, you see. Sītājī, His wife, being an Incarnation Herself, She said, "You must give Me some. After all, I am your ardhāṅgi[ni]." Is the half, better half. [Laughter.] But Lakṣhmaṇa was getting angry. He said, "Who is this old woman sitting here and giving such?"<br>
Uh we, we don't eat things, you see, eaten by others. We call it tustha, is a uttiṣhṭa, means, if the one who has eaten something is never given. And to Rāma?<br>
So, He get, was very angry, fuming with temper. So She takes it in Her hand and She tells Her brother-in-law, "Oh, this is the best I've had, oh my brother-in-law. I've never had such beautiful fruits." Now He gets tempted. And he says: "Really? [Laughter.] Can I have some?" She said, "No! It's only for Me and My husband! [Laughter.] You better ask her." So She asks ... He asks Śhabarī, "Can you give Me some, please?" The whole temper fizzles out. And then He sees the beauty of that fruit because it is done with love. "</font><br>

If Śhrī Rāma says, `All right, you go and get the ...,' uh He told Him the, "Go and get the-mhh-mh sañjīvanī," is the kind of a uh-uh-uh herb that was needed to bring Lakṣhmaṇa to life, He went there and He brought the whole mountain with Him, "Now, better have it." Is like that sort of a person, you see. So, He brought the -- that's, that's childlike behavior of His.<br>
And the discrimination in this is that, 'That, Śhrī ... if Śhrī Rāma has asked for, whatever He asked for I'll do it.'<br>
So, is a relationship of a, I would say, like a guru and śhiṣhya. But even more than that: that the śhiṣhya is just like a sssss... subservient servant, absolutely surrendered to God. Absolutely surrendered to God.<br>
And His main thing is surrender."</font><br>

<font color="red">"So the Love of God Almighty you already know, you have the knowledge. And whatever you wish to know you can know. Wherever He turns His attention, the attention will know what it is. He knows all this on your chakras, and also He knows how to correct these chakras. And the procedure is so beautiful, gentle and delicate, that to understand it we should have a heart. Unless we have a heart, we cannot understand that action of the Paramātma.<br>
Like the berries of Śhabarī. Śhabarī belonged to a simple class called Bhīls. Bhīls are among the lowest strata of the caste system. She was old, and her teeth were missing. She just had about three or four teeth in her mouth. When Śhrī Rām came to that area, she collected some berries, and pierced each one with her teeth, to taste if they were sweet, because she could not offer sour fruits to Him. That is why she selected each one carefully.<br>
When she offered them to Śhrī Rām, He got a glimpse of her love in it. He knew. He recognized that this was an offering of love. He accepted the whole lot, and began to eat them, one by one. He said, "I have never eaten such tasty berries before. They are pure Amṛut. His wife, who was verily the Devī, saw this and said, "Really? Then give Me also some." He said, "No! I am not giving any to anyone. These are for Me." Just see the mirth. Such a way of expressing His love. His wife said, "Look. I am Your other half, and You will have to share half with Me!" In the name of dharma He agreed, and gave Her some. Just two or three. Not more. She ate them, and She said, "What wonderful berries these are! I have never eaten this kind before."<br>
Normally, no one eats something that has been half eaten by someone else. But the half-eaten berries of this tribal woman, were eaten by both of Them. Lakṣhmaṇ was reacting, and got angry. He thought, 'What discourteous behavior is this! Such a great Incarnation is standing before us, and this woman has come with her half-eaten berries, and is actually feeding it to Him! And They seem to be eating and enjoying them.' And He got into a temper.<br>
But when Sītājī exclaimed that She had never eaten such tasty berries, He got a little tempted. He pleaded, "Please give me also a few. Please give." She said, "No. I will not give." Then He said, "All right, please forgive me. But please give me a few." So, Sītājī relented, and gave Him two or three. No sooner He ate the berries, His anger came down. He became absolutely cool.<br>
So in which way this loving banter, these waves of love, these small, small things are used by Paramātma to raise the level of a human being. It is only by these waves of love that a human being can be raised by Paramātma. This is how He tries to raise them. No other. Only God knows the different ways of setting right human beings."</font><br>

He took berries and started eating. He said, "This is Amṛut fruit, how beautiful!" His wife said, "I should also get some share as I am Your better half."<br>

Out of ten head's of Rāvaṇa one will fall down, but again it will assume its place. Lakṣhmaṇa suggested Śhrī Rāma to shoot an arrow in the heart of Rāvaṇa, without which he will not die. "Hit him in the heart." Śhrī Rāma was a very humble person. Though He was very powerful yet hH said to Lakṣhmaṇa that, "Rāvaṇa has placed My Sītā in his heart, therefore, I cannot hit him in the heart. Again and again when I chop off his heads, his attention will be diverted from the heart. Only then shall I shoot him in the heart."<br>

So among Hindus there's only one marriage. They don't have two marriages. And regard it as a very sinful to have another woman, according to Indian culture. There are some people who do it, but is wrong. Is not Indian.<br>
The father-in-law passed the law, because he has, he suffered -- he had two wives. And one of them tried to send Śhrī Rām to the jungle. She was so cruel, because she wanted her son to become the king. And, as it was the mistake of the father, that he had promish... promised that he will give her a boon [twp boons], because she had saved him in war. And so now, she asked him to send Śhrī Rām to the vanavas [vanam], to the-uh jungle. By-ee-eeh second one [boon], she asked to give the kingdom to her son, who was Lakṣhmaṇa.<br>
But when Lakṣhmaṇa came he didn't want. He said, "I don't want to take Śhrī Rāma's ... uah-uah-uah seat because it is his right."<br>
So he went to Śhrī Rām, in the jungle, requested him: "To You must come! You must come to Ayodhyā, to the capital city, and You should be crowned." Śhrī Rām said, "I can't do it. I have to fulfill my father's wish."<br>
But, at that moment,, the father said that,  "In India nobody will have second marriage." Because of two wives the whole family suffered! So, him ... he said, "Only we can have one wife, and no two wives."<br>
Very surprising, that even till today, in India they believe that you should have only one wife.<br>
But uh-uh-uh what you find in another countries, that people may not have another wife, but they have affairs and they do not respect their wives. This is very sad! And the this makes the country suffering. Because if the women are treated like that, the women suffer, and if the mother suffers the children suffer.<br>
So he made a law: that, 'Nobody will marry twice.' "</font><br>

<font color="red">"Later on Śhrī Rāma who was one of the Incarnations on this Earth, showed in his own life that he respected people for their aptitude. For example when Śhrī Rāma was exiled and went to a forest, he met there a poor old woman called Śhabarī who was of tribal caste. She offered some berries to Śhrī Rāma with great affection and devotion. She said: "Please eat them because they are not at all sour. I have already tasted them." The food or fruits tasted by somebody else are not to be eaten (uttiṣhṭa). If someone has bitten off even a part of a fruit, that fruit is no longer pure and cannot be offered to another person, certainly not to an Incarnation. But Śhrī Rāma was greatly moved by the love of the old lady. He accepted the berries with much joy and ate them. He praised their taste and gave some to his wife, Sītā. His brother Lakṣhmaṇ, felt rather jealous and asked for some berries for himself. There are many incidents where Śhrī Rām gets very friendly with people who were not of very high castes. Also his own Rāmāyaṇa, his life story, was written by a fisherman who was a dacoit. This fisherman was transformed into a Saint by another heavenly minstrel called Nārada. Of course an ordinary fisherman who was also a dacoit had such respect for Śhrī Rāma that he wrote this beautiful epic, the Rāmāyaṇa."</font><br>
