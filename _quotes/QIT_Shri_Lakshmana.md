<b>Version 1:</b><br>
Agni is our Brother-in-law (Dīr). That means Lakṣhmaṇa. They move about in the Form of Śheṣhanāg. But their main task is to protect our modesty. They come up to My Feet and no further."

<b>Version 2:</b><br>
"Agni is My dīra [brother-in-law], means He is Lakṣhmaṇ. He roams around in the Form of Śheṣhanāg. Protecting My chastity is His most important task. He only comes up to My Feet and never beyond it."</font><br>

<font color="red">"The gaze should be kept down to the ground.<br>
We have the example of Lakṣhmaṇa. Sītā was His sister-in-law. Now we do banter and joke with our sister-in-law. Even while talking to Her, He used to look at Her Feet only. Never used to look up. So much respect He must have had.<br>
So the gaze should be at the feet. Do not look in the upward direction. If someone does speak and ask, then look up slowly with great respect and reverence. This movement of the eyes helps in Sahaja Yoga."</font><br>

<font color="red">Now, you all should understand that when we talk about religion then it is more within than external.<br>
There are many examples for it. You can take example of Śhrī Rāma. There was an old lady without teeth, living in jungle, without taking bath. She brought the berries for Śhrī Rāma by tasting it that if they are sweet or sour and offered them to Śhrī Rāma. In Maharashtra they are very particular about this that they will not eat of it is eaten by others. Will you eat those berries? But Śhrī Rāma enjoyed them with love! He told to Sītā that, "I will not give you even one, I will eat them all. I never got such taste ever." Then that old lady said that I have more and they are broken by my teeth. Lakṣhmaṇa became very angry seeing all this. Then Sītājī said that, "It is true that even I have not tasted such berries ever in My life. Give Me more and also to My brother-in-law." It is described so beautifully." "</font><br>

Now they show the two sides of a human being.<br>
One was Lakṣhmaṇa, and he was that fiery type, you see. He couldn't bear anybody misbehaving towards Rāma. He couldn't bear anybody talking in a very mundane type to Śhrī Rāma. And he used to get so angry with all these people, that he would just come out like a big thunderbolt on anybody who tried to say anything about Śhrī Rām.<br>

<font color="red">"You know the story of Śhabarī. She was a very simple woman, an old lady with very few teeth.<br>
When Rāma was coming, she said, "What should I give to Śhrī Rām?"<br>
All right, she went round and round. There were, in the forest, some small, little what we call berries, ber, and she thought, 'It may not be sweet for my Rām. How will I give Him?" So, she picked them up, she used to test them with her teeth. One tooth she used to pierce in it and see if it is sweet. And then she would collect those. And those who were bad she threw away.<br>
When Śhrī Rām came, she said, "Śhrī Rām, I couldn't get anything but these for You. Will You have it?"<br>
Now, Śhrī Rāma, being an Incarnation, knew the depth of the love of this lady. He took it up in His hand. He knew that this is given by great love of a great heart.<br>
So, she says: "This I have tested each one of them. Don't have any doubts. I have tested in every one of them, they are all very sweet. You can have them." So: He puts it in the mouth, tells His wife, "I have never eaten such beautiful fruits, such great fruits, before."<br>
I mean, it's such a simple fruit, you see.<br>
Sītājī, His wife, being an Incarnation Herself, She said: "You must give Me some. After all, I am Your ardhāṅgi[ni]."<br>
Is a half, better half. [Laughter.]<br>
But Lakṣhmaṇa was getting angry. He said, "Who is this old woman sitting here and giving such?"<br>
Uh-uh-uh we, we don't eat things, you see, eaten by others. We call it tustha, is a uttiṣhṭa, means, if the one who has eaten something is never given. And to Rāma?<br>
So, He get, was very angry, fuming with temper. So She takes it in Her hand, and She tells Her brother-in-law: "Oh, this is the best I've had, oh my brother-in-law. I have never had such beautiful fruits." Now He gets tempted. And He says: "Really? [Laughter.] Can I have some?" She said, "No! It's only for Me and My husband! [Laughter.] You better ask her." So She asks-s-s ... He asks Śhabarī, "Can you give Me some, please?" The whole temper fizzles out. And then He sees the beauty of that fruit because it is done with love.<br>
So this is what it is: love which you have should be expanded."</font><br>

<font color="red">"Now, you have to notice on the streets of Maharashtra -- just now I was coming by train -- I saw no mens [men], there were [was] nobody who were interested in women, no women were interested in men, some men were hugging each other, walking around vmore ery innocently. I mean, the whole thing was that life-ph-ph is innocence.<br>
And that is what it was here when this rākṣhasa's wi... sister, Śhūrpaṇakhā.Mbr>
So nowadays if there is any woman in India who behaves like that, tries to entice men, is called as Śhūrpaṇakhā.<br>
So this woman came and tried to entice Śhrī Rāma.<br>
Imagine! What audacity! [Some laughter.]<br>
So Śhrī Rāma being saṅkochī, means He was a man full of grace, He told her, "See now, what's the use of running after Me? I have already got a beautiful wife. So why do you run after Me? Better try My brother who has no wife."<br>
Because He knew Him [laughter, laughs]. Becuase He knew that His brother is a ... Śheṣhanāga, 'He is the serpent on which ... very big serpent called Śheṣhanāg, Śheṣha. And He is a hot tempered fellow, and He will just know how to deal with this woman, I can't manage this show.' Because He would not ill-treat a woman! It was too much for Him. Though, she was Śhūrpaṇakhā, and not only that, but she was also a woman.<br>
So-o-o, when He went ... No! He ... He asked her: that, "You go and see Him."<br>
Lakṣhmaṇa was sitting outside.<br>
Lakṣhmaṇa had taken a vow to be a brahmachārī, elibate man, with fourteen years penance. Though He was a married man. This He had to do for that's the only way He could kill another demon, whose name was Meghanād, who had run away with His daughter, called as Sulochanā. It's a long story. [Laughter.]<br>
So make it short, this fellow went to this brahmachārī, Lakṣhmaṇa, though He had a wife in Ayodhyā, who is leading a life of a brahmachārī.<br>
Is very common in India. I mean if your wife is away, you just think about her, and you are in separation, still you enjoy your wife thinking about her! And thinking about the good things she has done to you.<br>
But if she has done all the time bad things you don't want to think about her [laughter], and then all these demonic things start."</font><br>

Is like that sort of a person, you see. So, He brought the -- that's, that's childlike behavior of His.<br>
And the discrimination in this is that, 'That, Śhrī ... if Śhrī Rāma has asked for, whatever He asked for I'll do it.'<br>
So, is a relationship of a, I would say, like a guru and śhiṣhya. But even more than that: that the śhiṣhya is just like a sssss... subservient servant, absolutely surrendered to God. Absolutely surrendered to God.<br>
And His main thing is surrender."</font><br>

<font color="red">"So the Love of God Almighty you already know, you have the knowledge. And whatever you wish to know you can know. Wherever He turns His attention, the attention will know what it is. He knows all this on your chakras, and also He knows how to correct these chakras. And the procedure is so beautiful, gentle and delicate, that to understand it we should have a heart. Unless we have a heart, we cannot understand that action of the Paramātma.<br>
Like the berries of Śhabarī. Śhabarī belonged to a simple class called Bhīls. Bhīls are among the lowest strata of the caste system. She was old, and her teeth were missing. She just had about three or four teeth in her mouth. When Śhrī Rām came to that area, she collected some berries, and pierced each one with her teeth, to taste if they were sweet, because she could not offer sour fruits to Him. That is why she selected each one carefully.<br>
When she offered them to Śhrī Rām, He got a glimpse of her love in it. He knew. He recognized that this was an offering of love. He accepted the whole lot, and began to eat them, one by one. He said, "I have never eaten such tasty berries before. They are pure Amṛut. His wife, who was verily the Devī, saw this and said, "Really? Then give Me also some." He said, "No! I am not giving any to anyone. These are for Me." Just see the mirth. Such a way of expressing His love. His wife said, "Look. I am Your other half, and You will have to share half with Me!" In the name of dharma He agreed, and gave Her some. Just two or three. Not more. She ate them, and She said, "What wonderful berries these are! I have never eaten this kind before."<br>
Normally, no one eats something that has been half eaten by someone else. But the half-eaten berries of this tribal woman, were eaten by both of Them. Lakṣhmaṇ was reacting, and got angry. He thought, 'What discourteous behavior is this! Such a great Incarnation is standing before us, and this woman has come with her half-eaten berries, and is actually feeding it to Him! And They seem to be eating and enjoying them.' And He got into a temper.<br>
But when Sītājī exclaimed that She had never eaten such tasty berries, He got a little tempted. He pleaded, "Please give me also a few. Please give." She said, "No. I will not give." Then He said, "All right, please forgive me. But please give me a few." So, Sītājī relented, and gave Him two or three. No sooner He ate the berries, His anger came down. He became absolutely cool.<br>
So in which way this loving banter, these waves of love, these small, small things are used by Paramātma to raise the level of a human being. It is only by these waves of love that a human being can be raised by Paramātma. This is how He tries to raise them. No other. Only God knows the different ways of setting right human beings."</font><br>

<font color="red">"And when the generosity is done innocently, you are not even aware of what you are doing. You just enjoy your generosity, and you don't bother as to see what is the reaction of the another person is.<br>
We have in our Śhāstras description of such people.<br>
Like Śhrī Rām, He went into the forest, and there was a very old lady of a ... uh-uh-uh what you call ... tribal, of a tribal area, very old. Only she had two teeth left.<br>
[After the trsnslator says, "Yes," and translates:] Her name was Śhabarī.<br>
And the ... she came before Śhrī Rām, and offered Him some ... ah-ha-ha plums you can say, the ber. 
......<br>
And she very innocently told Him, "See, all these I have tested with my teeth. And those who were sour, I have thrown away because You don't like sour ones. But they are all sweet."<br>
Normally, in India, people don't eat anything uh-uh-uh which has been touched by another mouth, you see.<br>
So, Śhrī Rāma says, "Oh, I see. You've done this work, so, please, may I have all these?" But His brother Lakṣhmaṇa was angry, 'What is this lady? She has no manners!' So, when she started putting this ber into the mouth of Śhrī Rāma, He was getting even worse. So, she said: "See how carefully I have uh done this testing, and you are enjoying. Ah, otherwise You would not have enjoyed them." And here, Shrī ... Lakṣhmaṇa was getting angry, very angry. So, Śh... Śhrī Rāma says: "Oh! What wonderful fruits! I have never eaten such fruits in My lifetime!" So, His wife Sītā, she said, "Why don't You give Me some?" He said, "No, no! These are for Me! I can't give You." So Sītājī said that: "After all, I am uh-uh-uh He... Your wife, and You have to share everything with Me." He said, "All right. As a matter of right I am giving You." So He gave those ber, those fruits, to Her. So Sītā said, "What? This is just like Ambros[i]a. Such beautiful fruits I have never eaten!" So She tells Her brother-in-law: "See, what fruits! These are heavenly fruits!" So He got tempted. So, Lakṣhmaṇa said: "Give Me some to taste also." So, Sītājī said: "No-no-no-no! I am not going to share. Uh after all, I have got it with great difficulty from Your mother [brother], I am not going to share." So, Śhrī Rāma said, "All right. Give Her ... give Him something, [<font color="orange">unclear</font> it's all right]." So this innocent old lady says: "No, I have some more! I can give Him. You can have Your share. I have some more, I can give Him." And she gave it to Lakṣhmaṇa. He started eating and He really enjoyed. So much He enjoyed! He said, "My God, I have never eaten such beautiful fruits." "</font><br>

So they are not sour. You can have it." Lakṣhmaṇa was angry. So, S-S-Sītājī says: "All right, let Me also have some of this." "Is no-no-no! These are the best, I won't give You!" "Let me have, I am Your wife, You see, must give Me." So He gave Her some. She said, "I've never eaten such nice berries!"<br>
See.<br>
So Lakṣhmaṇa says, "Then give Me also. Sister-in-law, please give some." "No-no, now I am not going to give You. Because You are so much angry because she had tasted it. I won't give You!" He said, "Please give Me." And She gives Him. And He really says that, "These are fruits from the Heavens!"<br>

<font color="red">"There are so many examples to show!<br>
For example, Śhrī Rāma ate the fruits from an old lady who had eaten them before to see that they are not sour.<br>
In India if somebody eats something, you'll never eat that. But look at Śhrī Rām.<br>
And then He tells His wife, "Oh! What fruits! Ihave never eaten like that." But the brother was angry! So brother says: "Why should she give you such fruits‽ Is not proper." So the wife says, "Please give Me some. After all I am your wife." Then she eats something, and says, "Wow-woh! What fruits!" Now the brother, Lakṣhmaṇa says: "Sister-in-law, give Me also little bit." Says, "No! You were so angry, I will not give You."<br>
The whole story shows the love, the compassion, the oneness, because of love. "</font><br>

<font color="red">"Śhrī Rāma met a tribal woman, perhaps you must have seen a Bhilni, tribal person. These people belong to Madhya Pradesh and are very ignorant people. Śhrī Rāma ate, that kind of an old women already tasted berries. He not only ate them, but also described them and gave them to His wife saying, "You also eat them, they are so tasty."

<font color="red">"In this way, there was no casteism before.<br>
I am going to give you proof for this.<br>
When Śhrī Rām went to jungle, Śhabarī an old woman who had very few teeth, tasted each piece of berry on her tooth, gave these to Śhrī Rām. So, Śhrī Rām said: "Oh! How sweet and nice these are!" He took berries and started eating. He said, "This is Amṛut fruit, how beautiful!" His wife said, "I should also get some share as I am Your better half."<br>
But Lakṣhmaṇjī was getting very angry that this old lady is touching the berries to her teeth and feeding [Him]. And she was Bhilni, meaning Śhūdra.<br>
Then His wife Sītājī said, "How nice these berries are!" Then Lakṣhmaṇjī said, "Give me some too." "Why shall I give? You are getting angry?" He said, "Please give me some." After eating some, he said, "These are just like Amṛut fruit."<br>
This is an example of Śhrī Rāmachandrajī, it proves that He did not believe in Śhūdra, etc."</font><br>

<font color="red">"We have [a] story like that.<br>
She told Śhrī Rām that she was an old woman from a-eh-eh-eh u-uh-uh downtrodden s-s-society, that "I have eaten every ... I have touched every uh-uh ber with my teeth, you see, and s... found out that there's none of them are uh-uh-uh sour."<br>
[After the translator first says, "Sour," and second translates:] In India, nobody eats uh-uh-h anything which is touched uh-uh by mouth, on any food, is regarded uttiṣhṭa, is a something wrong.<br>
But Śhrī Rām immediately took! He said: "Oh-oh, how sweet of you to have done this f... testing for Me." But His brother was very angry. He didn't like it, Lakṣhmaṇa. Śhrī Rāma ate, He said, "I've never eaten such beautiful bers." So, His wife Sītā said, "Give Me also little bit, I am Your half-f-f thing. You should give Me." So, when Śhrī Rāma gave Her, She ate, She said, "Oh, My goodness! What a beautiful fruit this one is." So Lakṣhmaṇa said, "Why not give Me?" He asked His sister-in-law: "Give Me also," He [Śhrī Rāma] said, "No! Because you were so angry." But She gave it to Lakṣhmaṇa, and Lakṣhmaṇa said: "I have never eaten such beautiful fruits."<br>
What was in that ber was nothing but giving sense of this old lady. She didn't have anything to give, she was poor lady, so she did all this just to give to Śhrī Rām.<br>
So the sharing, of your things, is an extremely joy-giving thing. "</font><br>

<font color="red">"To uphold the maryādās of the throne He renounced Śhrī Sītājī (who was very dear to Him), simply because people doubted Her despite her crossing the fire (Agni Parīkṣhā). Śhrī Sītājī Herself also left Śhrī Rāma, in a way in the end after bringing up Her children nicely; who had acquired all vidyās and had mastered the Art of Archery, so much so that they defeated their own uncle Śhrī Lakṣhmaṇa and ultimately Śhrī Rāma had to come to fight with them to free the horse of 'Aśhvamedh Yagñya'. But Śhrī Sītājī who stood on 'dharma', intervened and averted the fight between the father and the sons."</font><br>

<font color="red">"So, the third, bhakti part, also comes after Self-realization.<br>
Now in the bhakti, you see, there is no ... 'What is the value is?', and, 'How much you paid for it?', and, 'How you bought it?', is not important.<br>
For that an a great example is of Śhrī Rāma when He ... He went in the jungles. There was a[n] old lady from the scheduled's class, means she was uh-uh-uh ... one of the Bhilini [Bhilni] as they call it a -- these people live in the jungles. So she brought some berries, and offered it to Śhrī Rām. And she said that: "I have tasted all of them, and they are not sour. All of them I have tasted."<br>
Now, after tasting something in India, people call it, it's a ... become not to be eaten. I mean a ... we cannot eat ... taste something and give it to somebody else. Is not done, according to Indian culture.<br>
But Śhrī Rāma took it. He took it, He said, "What? Beautiful fruits, I've never eaten such fruit!" So, Lakṣhmaṇa got very angry! He said, "You, stupid woman, you have eaten these fruits and that's what you are giving to Śhrī Rām! Why did [you] do that?" So, Sītā was watching. So she asked Him, "Why don't you give Me some of these fruits?" He gave. She said, "My God! What nice fruits these are! I have never eaten such good fruits." So then Lakṣhmaṇa also His temper came down, and He said: "Can You not give Me some?" She said, "Why? You were so angry, why should I give You?" So ultimately, She gaves [gives] Him that fruit.<br>
So what did He see in those fruits? Was the love: the love of this old lady living in the forest, her love which was important."</font><br>

<font color="red">"Śhrī Rāma has many special qualities. He was very powerful and a perfect archer. You might have heard about what He did in Sītā Swayaṃwara.<br>
The same Śhrī Rāma killed the Rāvaṇa when He came to it. Tulasīdās has described His bow very very beautifully. Śhrī Rāma was aiming at Rāvaṇa's head with His arrow. Out of ten head's of Rāvaṇa one will fall down, but again it will assume its place. Lakṣhmaṇa suggested Śhrī Rāma to shoot an arrow in the heart of Rāvaṇa, without which he will not die. "Hit him in the heart." Śhrī Rāma was a very humble person. Though He was very powerful yet hH said to Lakṣhmaṇa that, "Rāvaṇa has placed My Sītā in his heart, therefore, I cannot hit him in the heart. Again and again when I chop off his heads, his attention will be diverted from the heart. Only then shall I shoot him in the heart."<br>
What an example of the love of a husband for His Wife! Ocean of Power, how He was full of love! "</font><br>

<font color="red">"So, at that time, Śhrī Rāma's mother-in-law, I should say, who was the wife of Daśharatha, she said ... she used to s... she's r... like a big uh-uh-uh ... Sādhunī, and she said that: "From today, two marriages are not allowed, only one."<br>
So among Hindus there's only one marriage. They don't have two marriages. And regard it as a very sinful to have another woman, according to Indian culture. There are some people who do it, but is wrong. Is not Indian.<br>
The father-in-law passed the law, because he has, he suffered -- he had two wives. And one of them tried to send Śhrī Rām to the jungle. She was so cruel, because she wanted her son to become the king. And, as it was the mistake of the father, that he had promish... promised that he will give her a boon [twp boons], because she had saved him in war. And so now, she asked him to send Śhrī Rām to the vanavas [vanam], to the-uh jungle. By-ee-eeh second one [boon], she asked to give the kingdom to her son, who was Lakṣhmaṇa.<br>
But when Lakṣhmaṇa came he didn't want. He said, "I don't want to take Śhrī Rāma's ... uah-uah-uah seat because it is his right."<br>
So he went to Śhrī Rām, in the jungle, requested him: "To You must come! You must come to Ayodhyā, to the capital city, and You should be crowned." Śhrī Rām said, "I can't do it. I have to fulfill my father's wish."<br>
But, at that moment,, the father said that,  "In India nobody will have second marriage." Because of two wives the whole family suffered! So, him ... he said, "Only we can have one wife, and no two wives."<br>
Very surprising, that even till today, in India they believe that you should have only one wife.<br>
But uh-uh-uh what you find in another countries, that people may not have another wife, but they have affairs and they do not respect their wives. This is very sad! And the this makes the country suffering. Because if the women are treated like that, the women suffer, and if the mother suffers the children suffer.<br>
So he made a law: that, 'Nobody will marry twice.' "</font><br>

<font color="red">"Later on Śhrī Rāma who was one of the Incarnations on this Earth, showed in his own life that he respected people for their aptitude. For example when Śhrī Rāma was exiled and went to a forest, he met there a poor old woman called Śhabarī who was of tribal caste. She offered some berries to Śhrī Rāma with great affection and devotion. She said: "Please eat them because they are not at all sour. I have already tasted them." The food or fruits tasted by somebody else are not to be eaten (uttiṣhṭa). If someone has bitten off even a part of a fruit, that fruit is no longer pure and cannot be offered to another person, certainly not to an Incarnation. But Śhrī Rāma was greatly moved by the love of the old lady. He accepted the berries with much joy and ate them. He praised their taste and gave some to his wife, Sītā. His brother Lakṣhmaṇ, felt rather jealous and asked for some berries for himself. There are many incidents where Śhrī Rām gets very friendly with people who were not of very high castes. Also his own Rāmāyaṇa, his life story, was written by a fisherman who was a dacoit. This fisherman was transformed into a Saint by another heavenly minstrel called Nārada. Of course an ordinary fisherman who was also a dacoit had such respect for Śhrī Rāma that he wrote this beautiful epic, the Rāmāyaṇa."</font><br>
