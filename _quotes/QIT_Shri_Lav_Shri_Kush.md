<font color="red">"And His daughter Fāṭimah was nobody else but Sītā Jānakī Herself.<br>
And Her two sons, Hasan and Husayn, were nobody else but Lava and Kuśha. They were born again and again: They were born as Mahāvīra and Buddha, and then They were born as Hasan and Husayn.<br>
It is only possible through Sahaja Yoga to realize that this is the Truth, this is the fact."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="red">"Now, beyond that is God's Realization.<br>
There are three stages to that also, but just now I have told this: the Sat-chit-ānand State.<br>
The God's Realization is the state in which Gautam Buddha and Mahāvīra only rose, and They are settled down here in our brains, both of Them are here, Christ is here.<br>
And these two were not Incarnations: They were born as human beings. They were born to Sītā, as Lav and Kuśh. Then they were born as Buddha and Mahāvīra. Then Ādi Śhakti was Their mother again. Then they were born to Fāṭimah Bi as Hasan and Husayn.<br>
They are both placed here, in your head.<br>
And They are the two milestones you have got, by which you can know what a human being can rise up to that now today They are like Incarnations. Incarnations are beyond, but maybe the gap can be bri... bridged."</font><br>

<font color="red">"Now in this Void we have two great entities as well which we know as Chandra [Moon] and Sūrya [Sun]. Moon and Sun are such chakras which reside on these nāḍīs here and here.<br>
On these chakras there are two very great personalities who have been appointed. They are complete embodiment of human beings. They are like humans, in fact are humans. Out of these one is Buddha and one is Mahāvīra.<br>
But if you listen to the whole history of Their lives, then these are two sons which Śhrī Sītā had as Lav and Kuśha who is completely in human form. And after They evolved to the level that They are here as Buddha and Mahāvīra. There also they thought They have reached an extreme of nonviolence because the supports of nonviolence came in and started protecting even mosquitoes and bugs.<br>
Then They again took birth and came at the time of Muhammad. Muhammad was an Incarnation of Śhrī Janaka and His daughter Fāṭimah Bi was also Incarnation of Śhrī Sītā.<br>
Then, as Their sons as Hasan and Husayn, They gave Their life in Karbalāʾ to prove that no kind of extreme is good.<br>
And this thing is Truth or not you can see on your vibrations. If [one thinks that] I am lying, then through your vibrations you would know that not even one single word is a lie here that I am telling you. "</font><br>

<font color="red">"They are all connected. Because Hazarat ʿAlī was the son-in-law of Prophet Muhammad and Prophet Muhammad was the Incarnation of King Janaka. His sons Hasan and Husayn, who were killed in the battle of Karbalā, were no one else but Sītājī's sons Lav and Kuśh, who were later incarnated as Mahāvīr and Buddha."</font><br>

<font color="red">"So, all those Personalities were absolutely divine, but one day Śhrī Rāma, who was an Incarnation of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, and Śhrī Sītā, who was Incarnation of Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī, gave birth, while they were on this Earth, to two children, of whom we can say that they had a Divine Nature as well as human. So, They had special powers, special helps, so that They could become leaders, leaders for human beings. They were named Lava and Kuśha. Lava, after Śhrī Rāma's death, left towards Caucasus, and this is the reason why the population in Russia are called Slavs; Kuśha went to China, and the people around there are called Kuṣhāṇs. [Or tous ceux-là sont des personnalités absolument divines, mais un jour, Śhrī Rāma, qui était une Incarnation de Śhrī Viṣhṇu, et Śhrī Sītā, qui était une Incarnation de Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī, mirent au monde, alors qu'ils étaient sur cette terre, deux enfants, dont nous pouvons dire qu'ils étaient de nature divine autant qu'humaine. En effet, ils avaient des pouvoirs, des aides spéciales, de telle façon qu'ils pouvaient devenir des leaders, des chefs pour les êtres humains. Ces deux enfants furent nommés Lāva et Kuśha. Lava partit après la mort de Śhrī Rāma, vers la Caucase, et c'est pourquoi les peuples de Russie se nomment les Slaves; et Kuśha alla vers la Chine, et le gens ce pays s'appelèrent Kouchanes.]<br>
Those two Incarnations, we will call them Principle of the Disciple. Not the Guru Principle, which also incarnates, but that one is fully of Divine Nature. So, these two incarnate as Disciple Principle. [Ces deux Incarnations, nous Les nommerons Le Principe du Disciple, pas de Principe du Gourou, lequel s'incarne aussi, mais celui-ci est entièrement de Nature Divine. Donc, ceux-là s'incarnent sur cette terre comme Principes du Disciple.]<br>
First, they incarnated, as we say, as Lava and Kuśha, each one being specially assisted by Saint Gabriel and Saint Michel. [Tout d'abord ils s'incarnèrent, nous dirons, comme Lava and Kuśha, chacun est spécialement assisté par Saint Gabriel et Saint Michel.]<br>
These two Incarnations incarnated later as Buddha and Mahāvīra, who came once again as Śhaṅkara [who had been Buddha] and Kabīr [who had been Mahāvīra]. Kahlil Gibran is part of their Incarnations. So was Mārkaṇḍeya, and we can say that our William Blake is part of it. [Ces deux Incarnations s'incarnèrent plus tard comme Bouddha et Mahāvīra, lesquels revinrent à nouveau au sixième siècle de notre èrecomme Śhankara [c'était Bouddha], puis [c'était Mahāvīra]. Kahlil Gilran fait partie de Leurs Incarnations. Mārkaṇḍeya aussi, et on peut dire que notre Mister Blake en fait partie.]<br>
So, they came back as poets, as devotees of God, with an astounding capacity to create songs, music, and to talk about God. [Ainsi Ils sont venus comme poètes, comme dépôts de Dieu, avec une étonnante capacité de créer des chants, de la musique, de parler de Dieu.]<br>
Otherwise they incarnated as Hasan and Husayn, the sons of Fāṭimah, daughter of Muhammad and wife of ʿAlī. [Par ailleurs, Ils se sont incarnés comme Hasan and Husayn, les fils de Fāṭimah, la fille de Mahomet et l'épouse d' ʿAlī.]<br>
So they incarnated so many times on this Earth, those who correspond to the Principle of the Disciple. [Ainsi se sont incarnés tant de fois sur cette terre ceux qui correspondaient au Principe du Disciple.]"</font><br>

Can there be a greater example to show how Shri Sita never considered the existence of caste and bestowed Divine rights on the people irrespective of ant caste<i>?</i> It seems Shri Rama and Shri Sita deliberately created situations to <i>put</i> down the horrible caste system which had become the cancer of the Indian society. <i>It is so evident how they respected a Saint like ValmiKi despite his very low birth according to this curse of the caste system.</i>"</font><br>

Another son was Kuśh, who went to China, that is why they are called as Kuṣhāṇ.<br>

<b>Version 1:</b><br>
"When we look into Their life, They were both devoted to each other but when Śhrī Rāma sacrificed Śhrī Sītā, She never spoke ill about Him, She felt it was His duties to do so. With all easiness She took care and grew up the two sons of Śhrī Rāma, Lav and Kuśh. They both showed us the qualities of disciple: They showed how we have to dedicate to our Guru. At very small age They knew the art of bow and arrow, also They knew Rāmāyaṇa and other epics very well."<br>
<br>
<b>Version 2:</b>
"You see how Śhrī Sītā and Rāma have good attitude and are faithful [to] each other.<br>
Even if She was left, Sītā thought it Her duty. She never complained or talked ill of Him. And effortlessly She has raised Her children. Śhrī Rāma's children are called Lav and Kuśh. They came as devotees and we can see Them as disciples. They represent śhiṣhya [disciples], the Power of Śhiṣhya.<br>
So we can be disciple of someone.<br>
As disciples They learned archery when they were small. And learned Rāmāyaṇa and got proficiency in the music showing the disciples must surrender completely to the guru."<br></font><br>

<font color="red">"Princess Sītā was married to King Rāma in a very traditional way. When He went into exile, Rāvaṇa the rākṣhasa, Satan disguised as an ascetic, appeared before Her and took Her away to the capital of his kingdom in Lanka. Rāma fought a war with Rāvaṇa to rescue His wife, who was secluded by Rāvaṇa in the core of his island kingdom. Rāma defeated His enemy and brought Sītā back to His kingdom, Ayodhyā. Although She was the purest of the pure, and the holiest of the holy, She was treated with suspicion by the citizens of Ayodhyā, Rāma's capital city. They would not accept Her as queen, blaming Her for having been abducted by force by Rāvaṇa. The suspicious citizens questioned Her chastity, and committed collective sin by rejecting Her. Although She was pregnant Rāma was forced to forsake Her. She lived with the Saint Vālmīki in the jungles of Bihar State where She gave birth to twin boys, Lava and Kuśha. They were absolutely human personalities but of very great spiritual heritage from previous births. Sītā taught them the divine way of life. They were later born again in Bihar as Gautama, known as Lord Buddha, and as Śhrī Mahāvīra, the leader of the great religion, Jainism. This all happened 500 years before the birth of Christ. Internally they reached a very great height through these births. They preached the doctrine of nonviolence (<i>ahiṃsā</i>) which was later developed into an extreme form of vegetarianism. They took birth in the warrior caste (<i>Kṣhatriya</i>) rather than as fanatical Brahmins in order to keep away from the extremes of vegetarian abstinences, and to stay more balanced. Still their disciples carried their teachings to the extreme of abstinence and vegetarianism. They confused inner asceticism (<i>saṃnyāsa</i>) with organized institutions of asceticism, and nonviolence with vegetarianism. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was later very much criticized by the so-called vegetarian followers of Buddha and Mahāvīra. "</font><br>
