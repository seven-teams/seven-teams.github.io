<font color="red">"And His daughter Fāṭimah was nobody else but Sītā Jānakī Herself.<br>
And Her two sons, Hasan and Husayn, were nobody else but Lava and Kuśha. They were born again and again: They were born as Mahāvīra and Buddha, and then They were born as Hasan and Husayn.<br>
It is only possible through Sahaja Yoga to realize that this is the Truth, this is the fact."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="red">"Now, beyond that is God's Realization.<br>
There are three stages to that also, but just now I have told this: the Sat-chit-ānand State.<br>
The God's Realization is the state in which Gautam Buddha and Mahāvīra only rose, and They are settled down here in our brains, both of Them are here, Christ is here.<br>
And these two were not Incarnations: They were born as human beings. They were born to Sītā, as Lav and Kuśh. Then they were born as Buddha and Mahāvīra. Then Ādi Śhakti was Their mother again. Then they were born to Fāṭimah Bi as Hasan and Husayn.<br>
They are both placed here, in your head.<br>
And They are the two milestones you have got, by which you can know what a human being can rise up to that now today They are like Incarnations. Incarnations are beyond, but maybe the gap can be bri... bridged."</font><br>

<font color="red">"Now in this Void we have two great entities as well which we know as Chandra [Moon] and Sūrya [Sun]. Moon and Sun are such chakras which reside on these nāḍīs here and here.<br>
On these chakras there are two very great personalities who have been appointed. They are complete embodiment of human beings. They are like humans, in fact are humans. Out of these one is Buddha and one is Mahāvīra.<br>
But if you listen to the whole history of Their lives, then these are two sons which Śhrī Sītā had as Lav and Kuśha who is completely in human form. And after They evolved to the level that They are here as Buddha and Mahāvīra. There also they thought They have reached an extreme of nonviolence because the supports of nonviolence came in and started protecting even mosquitoes and bugs.<br>
Then They again took birth and came at the time of Muhammad. Muhammad was an Incarnation of Śhrī Janaka and His daughter Fāṭimah Bi was also Incarnation of Śhrī Sītā.<br>
Then, as Their sons as Hasan and Husayn, They gave Their life in Karbalāʾ to prove that no kind of extreme is good.<br>
And this thing is Truth or not you can see on your vibrations. If [one thinks that] I am lying, then through your vibrations you would know that not even one single word is a lie here that I am telling you. "</font><br>

<font color="red">"They are all connected. Because Hazarat ʿAlī was the son-in-law of Prophet Muhammad and Prophet Muhammad was the Incarnation of King Janaka. His sons Hasan and Husayn, who were killed in the battle of Karbalā, were no one else but Sītājī's sons Lav and Kuśh, who were later incarnated as Mahāvīr and Buddha."</font><br>

These are both very special, for guidance to human beings. These both are Luv and Kuśh. Luv and Kuśh took birth as Buddha and Mahāvīra, both have the same mother. Both these Luv and Kuśh were born when work was being done on Nābhī chakra along with Chandra nāḍī and Sūrya nāḍī.<br>

<font color="red">"Śhrī Rām was the ideal husband where as Śhrī Sītājī was an ideal wife and the children born to Them, known as Lav and Kuśha, were also the ideal sons."</font><br>

<font color="red">"Princess Sītā was married to King Rāma in a very traditional way. When He went into exile, Rāvaṇa the rākṣhasa, Satan disguised as an ascetic, appeared before Her and took Her away to the capital of his kingdom in Lanka. Rāma fought a war with Rāvaṇa to rescue His wife, who was secluded by Rāvaṇa in the core of his island kingdom. Rāma defeated His enemy and brought Sītā back to His kingdom, Ayodhyā. Although She was the purest of the pure, and the holiest of the holy, She was treated with suspicion by the citizens of Ayodhyā, Rāma's capital city. They would not accept Her as queen, blaming Her for having been abducted by force by Rāvaṇa. The suspicious citizens questioned Her chastity, and committed collective sin by rejecting Her. Although She was pregnant Rāma was forced to forsake Her. She lived with the Saint Vālmīki in the jungles of Bihar State where She gave birth to twin boys, Lava and Kuśha. They were absolutely human personalities but of very great spiritual heritage from previous births. Sītā taught them the divine way of life. They were later born again in Bihar as Gautama, known as Lord Buddha, and as Śhrī Mahāvīra, the leader of the great religion, Jainism. This all happened 500 years before the birth of Christ. Internally they reached a very great height through these births. They preached the doctrine of nonviolence (<i>ahiṃsā</i>) which was later developed into an extreme form of vegetarianism. They took birth in the warrior caste (<i>Kṣhatriya</i>) rather than as fanatical Brahmins in order to keep away from the extremes of vegetarian abstinences, and to stay more balanced. Still their disciples carried their teachings to the extreme of abstinence and vegetarianism. They confused inner asceticism (<i>saṃnyāsa</i>) with organized institutions of asceticism, and nonviolence with vegetarianism. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was later very much criticized by the so-called vegetarian followers of Buddha and Mahāvīra. "</font><br>
