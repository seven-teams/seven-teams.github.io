"But in some people that stability has to be brought about. No problem. You have obtained that thing, you recognized it, you reached there and there is a complete arrangement for bringing stability.<br>
<font color="red">As soon as that stability is achieved, in Absolute Peace and Joy, you achieve that Witness State described by Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, by Jesus, by all the Scriptures whether by Zoroaster, Socrates, Confucius or any of Dattātreya's Incarnations.</font><br>
Till today, these people who were of a higher state, who would take birth in a higher state, would talk in a manner that others were unable to understand. They could see matters of the tenth floor and others would remain on the first floor and they would just not understand what was being talked about."<br>

"After that there is Nābhī center. For Nābhī center you know that whatever has happened in the evolution from fish to human being, everything has happened here.<br>
<font color="red">For helping in it many Big Gurus have Incarnated inside us, whom you know from Socrates to Confucius, Moses, Rāja Janak, Muhammad Sāhab, Nāṇak Sāhab, Kabīr, all these Big Gurus, all of Them have worked hard on it and made dharma of human beings. It is the dharma of human beings inside, in the stomach, not outside.</font><br>
Like dharma of this gold is that it does not get spoiled, it is untarnishable.<br>
In the same way Ten Dharma[s] of human beings are formed inside the stomach."<br>

"Now, all the Gurus, all the Gurus who came, say from ... we can start from Socrates, then Abraham, Moses, this is the Guru Tattwa, is the Principle of Master, Primordial Masters. The Principle is born again and again. In India we can say the Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], we had one Ādināth, the Guru long time back. Then we had Dattātreya, we had uh Janaka, Nāṇaka, Sāī Nāth. <font color="red">We had in the Middle East Muhammad Sāhab, Lao Tze in China, Confucius. All these Great Principles of Gurus who were born, They had one job to do is to establish your dharma. Their job was not to give you Realization.</font><br>
You must understand: everyone has one's own job. See, Mine is a horrible job [laughing:] because I have to do everybody's jobs.<br>
But Their job was just to establish your dharma. They came at that time in those places where it was needed the most.<br>
So, these Ten Principles, as I told you, They established [dharma].</font><br> 
<font color="red">They are created in the Void.<br>
As you see here the Void part, this part is made out of the water element. <font color="red">So, whatever miracles They did, had something to do with water, like They could create water anywhere They wanted to. They would not cure people. All of Them have created water in the desert or in the places where ... like in ... Nāṇaka has created a Pan̄jā Sāhab they call it, or everywhere They have been able to create water. Whatever They touched, They could create water out of it.</font><br>
Water is the life, life force which sustains us. Without water we cannot live! The is the sustainance [sustenance].<br>
<font color="red">But, They actually are symbolized in an ocean, in the ocean, because They give us the salt, the salt of life, which gives us the sustainance [sustenance].</font> If you see the salt, if we do not have salt in our body, we'll have no sustainance [sustenance]."<br>

"And these Ten Sustainances [Sustenances] are represented by Great Prophets. The Principle is called as Ādi Guru, in Sanskrit language, the Primordial Master. <font color="red">He had incarnated on this Earth as Abraham, Moses, as Lao Tze, as Confucius, as Socrates.</font> Recently, He has been as Sāī Nāth of Śhirḍī, not the other fellow, and other great people have been like Nāṇaka, Janaka.<br>
All these Great Saints can ... came on this Earth to tell us: how to keep in the center, how to keep our sustenance, how to be human beings.<br>
As carbon has got four valances, we too have got ten valances. We have to maintain those ten valances within us! That's what they came to tell us."<br>

"The Primordial Master was also born as Macchindranāth, and again as Zoroaster who was worshiped by the ancient Persians, and still revered by Parsis. Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism. <font color="red">In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates.</font> He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā). Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918. Altogether there were ten major Avatāras of Dattātreya."<br>

"Religious fundamentalism and fanaticism have already become a threat to World Peace. We had a discussion with some religious people in Italy and they refused to accept a religion which was global. They wanted to have exclusive religions. In this way they promote conflict between the followers of one religion and those of another. They believe that killing others in the name of religion is their duty. On the other hand all the great philosophers, Incarnations, Prophets and Sufis have never talked about any exclusive religion. <font color="red">Confucius first talked about humanity, but then came Tao of Lao Tze who tried to bring the subtle side of humanity.</font> This Tao is something like the Kuṇḍalinī of Sahaja Yoga. I have traveled through the Yangtze River. This voyage on a boat gave me a unique experience and enabled me to understand Lao Tze very well. This river is a very dangerous one in the beginning for boats to pass through. There are lots of currents which flow in different directions. But along the side of this river there are beautiful manifestations of nature. The very steep, rising mountains that we see in the paintings of the Chinese are all to be seen there with rivers flowing between them. It is very beautiful to see the bank of the Yangtze River. As Lao Tze had said: "It may be very beautiful and attractive outside, but you should keep your mind inside and ply through the Yangtze River". This is very significant, but how many understand what He has said? How many have tried to follow Him? In China many people do not seem to care much for Lao Tze and His Tao, but there will come a time when they will realize that that is the subtle side of humanity."<br>
