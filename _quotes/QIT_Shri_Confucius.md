<font color="red">As soon as that stability is achieved, in Absolute Peace and Joy, you achieve that Witness State described by Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, by Jesus, by all the Scriptures whether by Zoroaster, Socrates, Confucius or any of Dattātreya's Incarnations.</font><br>

"Now, all the Gurus, all the Gurus who came, say from ... we can start from Socrates, then Abraham, Moses, this is the Guru Tattwa, is the Principle of Master, Primordial Masters. The Principle is born again and again. In India we can say the Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], we had one Ādināth, the Guru long time back. Then we had Dattātreya, we had uh Janaka, Nāṇaka, Sāī Nāth. <font color="red">We had in the Middle East Muhammad Sāhab, Lao Tze in China, Confucius. All these Great Principles of Gurus who were born, They had one job to do is to establish your dharma. Their job was not to give you Realization.</font><br>
You must understand: everyone has one's own job. See, Mine is a horrible job [laughing:] because I have to do everybody's jobs.<br>
<font color="red">But Their job was just to establish your dharma. They came at that time in those places where it was needed the most.<br>
So, these Ten Principles, as I told you, They established [dharma].</font><br> 
<font color="red">They are created in the Void.</font><br>
As you see here the Void part, this part is made out of the water element. <font color="red">So, whatever miracles They did, had something to do with water, like They could create water anywhere They wanted to. They would not cure people. All of Them have created water in the desert or in the places where ... like in ... Nāṇaka has created a Pan̄jā Sāhab they call it, or everywhere They have been able to create water. Whatever They touched, They could create water out of it.</font><br>
Water is the life, life force which sustains us. Without water we cannot live! The is the sustainance [sustenance].<br>
<font color="red">But, They actually are symbolized in an ocean, in the ocean, because They give us the salt, the salt of life, which gives us the sustainance [sustenance].</font> If you see the salt, if we do not have salt in our body, we'll have no sustainance [sustenance]."<br>

"Now, since long, from ancient times, we have been hearing about the Spirit: that, 'We are the Spirit,' 'We have to become the Spirit.' <font color="red">Whether you take Confucius, or you have Lao Tze, or you have any Indian philosopher, or you may be having any one of the others in the West where Christ has said many a times that, 'We have to be the Spirit.'</font><br>
......<br>
So, first of all forget about your mental processes.<br>
<font color="red">For example, a person who is a very highly person uh realizable Soul, whom Confucius calls as a Superior Man -- He call him a Superior Man, imagine! According to Confucius, a man who is rich, who is well-educated is not superior. He is a primitive person. [Laughing:] Compared to a person who is a developed, evolved personality, according to be superior, all others are primitive people, at a lower level. That's how He describes them: Superior Men. You see, to Him: only the Superior Men can understand humanity.<br>
He talks, because He was of that level, so He talked on that level, on the Superior Man.</font><br>
So the Superior Man, who is within us, who has to manifest itself, is the personality which resides, which has to express itself when we ... our attention reaches that state. Attention has to reach that state and not our mental process and all the yarn that comes out of it.<br>
So, first of all, the thinking has to be stopped."<br>

"Now, in the beginning, I am going to tell you: how medically we suffer with this kind of a treatment that we have.<br>
I am not to, in any way, uh-uhh cast any how, anything wrong about the doctors. I have also done medicine Myself and I know what one has to do about it.<br>
<font color="red">But there should be an open-mindedness of a doctor, that he should see that, 'There could be a better way of understanding this medicine, from a higher point of view, if you can become a superior personality,' what Confucius had said.</font><br>
To achieve that superior personality, one need not have to go to medical college or do his uh other higher studies, but just it is something he has to find within himself.<br>
......<br>
And that is what is dharma: is the ten valences within us. <font color="red">These ten valances are nothing but dharma, which was preached by all the Great Saints. We can start it from Ādināth, we can say Lao Tze, we can say Confucius, we can say Zoroaster, we can say Muhammad Sāhab, we can say Nāṇak Sāhab, we can say Janaka, we can say the, all of Them are the representation or manifestation of Dattātreya, which we know very well in Maharashtra what is Dattātreya.</font><br>
But despite all that, we do not know: we'll worship Dattātreya, and we will not follow Him.<br>
This is the only problem we have. That: we have all the ideals, we have all the capacity to understand that this is something great, but we have no power to follow it. Because we are not Samartha, we are not equal to the meaning of a human being."<br>

"For example, now you are walking, and you are blind, supposing. Now I will say, 'All right. You take your first step first.' This is the first step. And He said, "First step was Self-realization." He [Lord Buddha] said, "First you get your Self-realization."<br>
<font color="red">Confucius, on the contrary of that, He said, "All right. Let us start seeing in the communities." You see, He believed in the communities, how it works out in the society, in the people, in the collective. Because He Himself was a realized Soul and He could see that it will work out more on the collective.</font><br>

The sublimity is to be felt within us, giving us joy. Even the virtue, the righteousness, the goodness, the sweetness, has to be felt within us giving us joy! We should enjoy our virtue!"<br>

"They have described that, 'Through the ascent of the Kuṇḍalinī only you can reach your Spirit.' All the Upaniṣhadas, which are the second part of the Vedas, all of them have described the Kuṇḍalinī. Only thing, the difference is: that some said, 'By doing this, by doing that,' 'By uh abstinence,' some said, 'By accepting uh the right part, the central part,' 'By building up your balance,' all these different, different style of things to modulate a human being to lead a moderate life, they have built up their own literature.<br>
But every one of them exist: exist because they want to talk about your ascent to be the Spirit. There's nothing else but that! That's the basic point!<br>
And Kuṇḍalinī is the Fundamental Power which has to be awakened: all of them have the same.<br>
But it happens: that a person who is more extrovert, always tries to go to something new. [Drinks water.] And when he tries to go to something new, he forgets that: 'There has been a tradition of that for ages! And why should we suddenly accept a new idea?'<br>
<font color="red">Confucius, Socrates, Abraham, Moses, later on Christ, all of Them have talked about the Spirit.</font><br>
Muhammad Sāhab has talked about the Kuṇḍalinī, calling It a 'Asas.<br>

We have Nāṇaka and Janaka who have talked about it. That it is within us, and we have to achieve it within ourselves.</font><br>

For the first time you start enjoying another person without lust or greed.<br>
Once in Calcutta [Kolkata], I was staying in a hotel, and we had about three, four Sahaja Yogis in another room. And the owner of the hotel came to Me: "Mother, please give me Realization." And when he got his Realization, all of them from their rooms came running! "What has happened, we are feeling so joyous?" I said, "See, the vibrations of this man! Feel the vibrations!" And they stood there, for at least half an hour, enjoying him and he enjoying them. No thought passed. They did not know he was the owner of the hotel, or he ... they ... he did not know who they were, from what part of the country! <font color="red">Pure joy of humanity which Confucius has described.

"Now when I'm talking to you about the mechanism that is built within us for our last breakthrough, you need not believe Me. <br>
In our country also, this knowledge was kept a secret for thousands of years. Though we can say people like Mārkaṇḍeya, whose dates could be fourteen thousand [years ago], or later on, up to Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, people did write about the Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
And at the time of Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, He very clearly talked about it. That was the tradition of evolution described in all these great Scriptures.<br>
Even in the Bible, you find the Tree of Fire. It says: "I will appear before you as tongues of flames." <br>
Even Muhammad Sāhab, who came much later, very clearly, very, very clearly, and elaborately, at length, talked about the Resurrection Day. He said: "At the Time of Resurrection, your hands will speak."<br>
But everybody missed the point.<br>
Zoroaster talked about it thousands of years back. <font color="red">Confucius, Lao Tze, everyone talked about it: that, 'We have to be the Spirit.'</font><br>
Christ clearly said: "You are to be born-again!" Then Nicodemus asked Him: "Do you mean to say, I should enter into the womb of my mother?" "No," He said, "whatever is born of the flesh is the flesh. You are to be born of the Holy Ghost." "<br>

"Now this, special thing as called as Kuṇḍalinī, is not to be discarded because It's coming from India.<br>
It has been described in every Scripture. Even in the Bible is described, that, "I'll appear before you like tongues of flames."<br>
[Pointing to the Chakra Chart:] These are the tongues of flames you see, along the path of the Kuṇḍalinī.<br>

"The Primordial Master was also born as Macchindranāth, and again as Zoroaster who was worshiped by the ancient Persians, and still revered by Parsis. Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism. <font color="red">In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates.</font> He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā). Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918. Altogether there were ten major Avatāras of Dattātreya."<br>

"Religious fundamentalism and fanaticism have already become a threat to World Peace. We had a discussion with some religious people in Italy and they refused to accept a religion which was global. They wanted to have exclusive religions. In this way they promote conflict between the followers of one religion and those of another. They believe that killing others in the name of religion is their duty. On the other hand all the great philosophers, Incarnations, Prophets and Sufis have never talked about any exclusive religion. <font color="red">Confucius first talked about humanity, but then came Tao of Lao Tze who tried to bring the subtle side of humanity.</font> This Tao is something like the Kuṇḍalinī of Sahaja Yoga. I have traveled through the Yangtze River. This voyage on a boat gave me a unique experience and enabled me to understand Lao Tze very well. This river is a very dangerous one in the beginning for boats to pass through. There are lots of currents which flow in different directions. But along the side of this river there are beautiful manifestations of nature. The very steep, rising mountains that we see in the paintings of the Chinese are all to be seen there with rivers flowing between them. It is very beautiful to see the bank of the Yangtze River. As Lao Tze had said: "It may be very beautiful and attractive outside, but you should keep your mind inside and ply through the Yangtze River". This is very significant, but how many understand what He has said? How many have tried to follow Him? In China many people do not seem to care much for Lao Tze and His Tao, but there will come a time when they will realize that that is the subtle side of humanity."<br>
