<font color="red">As soon as that stability is achieved, in Absolute Peace and Joy, you achieve that Witness State described by Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, by Jesus, by all the Scriptures whether by Zoroaster, Socrates, Confucius or any of Dattātreya's Incarnations.</font><br>

"So the dharma that has been established in us by God Almighty because if we want to go to the Kingdom of God, then in our freedom we must desire to get to God. If someone tries to pressurize us and says, 'You must ask for God,' then it is of no use, it is not an evaluation. That is why to reach in this state, a person has to seek the God as per his own independent sweet will and not due to any pressure, or any disease or any hardships or any sorrow, but only because of the fact and realizing that, 'It is the only motive of our life to seek God.'<br>

His birthday was celebrated the other day. And that day I was so very happy, you don't know, and it was extremely hot weather. Then I said ... I said, "All right, have any drops from flowers to the leaves," and they said, "Today is His birthday." And I was so happy today, all the time.<br>
'Was He the Incarnation of our sustainance [sustenance]?' 'And is He within us?'<br>
He looks after our sustainance [sustenance].<br>
He was not the property of Greeks, He was everybody's property which is within us, on this green Void, as you call it. He exists there.</font><br>

They ... they want to, you see, even the Christ, even Christ, they don't think much of Him, they never thought much of Him. Now, I don't know what, they think because He's no more! What did you think of Him? You see, not one educated person went to Him, not one!<br>

"Apart from that, there is [a] third type of Incarnations which worked [pointing to the Void on the Chakra Chart:] in this gap: to sustain us. These are Ten Pri... Primordial Masters, the Ādi Guru. These people incarnated on this Earth to give us our sustainance [sustenance], our religion as they call it. They gave us those Ten Religions or sustainance [sustenance] which is important for a human being.<br>
This Principle of Primordial Master incarnated as Abraham, as Moses, as Muhammad Sāhab, as Janaka, as Nāṇaka, and recently, till recently, the One who is no more a now, is Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth.<br>
[During the translation helps with the enumeration:] Muh... mhh. <font color="red">Socrates.</font> Nāṇaka.<br>
Yes.<br>
<font color="red">Now, these people are Incarnation[s] of the one Principle, that is Primordial Master.<br> 
The energy or the power with which They work[ed] is either a sister or a daughter: is a very pure relationships.<br> 
If you read Their teachings you will find [that] They are saying the same things. Because They were worried about our sustainance [sustenance].</font>"<br>

"For example, we can say the gree... green thing is the one that represents the water, water element. This center the ... in the stomach is the water element within us. It is called as Nābhī chakra, and around it is called as the Bhavasāgara, you can say the Void, or you can say the Gap, or whatever you may say, the whole world as such, within us. So, the people who were born on this center, around this center, were born out of water element.<br>
<font color="red">In this Bhavasāgara -- oc... Bhavasāgara means the ocean of this world -- were born, through this ocean of the world, were born all the Primordial Masters, one after another. We can say Abraham, Moses, we had Janaka, were Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], and Socrates, and so many others like that, Nāṇaka, and also very recently, we had about hundred years back, a very great Saint born in India known as Sāī Nāth.<br>
They all represent the same element that is the water element. Being responsible or being born out of that, They are anxious to maintain water element as the one which is within us for sustaining ourselves. We su... we are sustained by water, so They help us to sustain ourselves. They are the sustainers: They tell us how to sustain us as a human being.<br>
And all of Them have tried to establish religion within us.</font><br>
A religion doesn't mean outside, but the religion as a man: means the capacity of a man, or you can say the quality of a man. What a human being should be like, what is the way to know if he is a human being or not, which is described in al... in the Ten Commandments."<br>

"But in the history of spirituality all over the world, we find there has been great contributions by people, who otherwise were very wise, very intelligent, and extremely generous people. They could not have been false. They could not have lied to us.<br>
<font color="red">For example let us take the case of Socrates. Socrates has told us that: 'We have to leave our body for the second life and that when we live on this world, when we live as human beings on this Earth, we have to keep ourselves in such a way that we do not spoil our being. That we have a sustainance [sustenance] within us, a quality that makes us human beings, by which we can be called as human beings.'</font><br>
What is the difference between human beings and animals?<br>
As so many others also have said the same thing: 'That we are human beings, because we are human beings we have to maintain a certain amount of sustainance [sustenance].'<br> 
<font color="red">After Socrates we had people like Abraham and Moses, They also said the same thing! There isn't much difference in what They said and Socrates had said.<br>
Socrates had said one a ... one more thing: 'That there are Deities within us, and we have to look after those Deities. We have to keep Them pleased.'</font><br>
Moses, when He found Ten Commandments, actually He found those Ten Methods by which He was telling us, that, 'We should be able to keep our existence as human being[s],' by following those Ten Commandments.<br>
Sustainance [sustenance] means the one we sustain within us. In Sanskrit knowl... language it is called as dharma. "Dhārayati [yena] sa dharmaḥ" [related to Mahābhārata 12.110.11]: the one which sustain[s] within ourselves.<br>
......<br>
To normalize you, all these Great Saints were born on this Earth, in this Void of the Big Primordial Being. And they exist within us, though they are not awakened as yet.<br>
We have had mainly Ten of Them. In India, we can call Them, from a very long time, as Ādināth, who was thousands of year[s] back. <font color="red">I have told you Socrates, Moses, Abraham, then Rāja Janaka.</font> Then we had, later on, Muhammad Sāhab, then Nāṇaka. Then the last, one of Them, was Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth. He was another Primordial Master, a great man.<br>
<font color="red">They are the Incarnations of the One Personality! They said the same thing and same thing and same thing: how to sustain yourself. Their job was not to give you Realization, but to sustain you: to make you capable of your Realization, to make you a proper recipient of God's blessings as realized Souls.</font><br>
If the pot is not all right, if it has all the holes in it, what's the use of pouring Ganges into it?<br>
<font color="red">So They clogged all the points, and said that, "This should not be done."</font><br>
But as we have made mess of everything, we have made mess of Them also. All of us! Whether you are English, Indians or this thing doesn't matter. Whether you are Christians, Muslims or a Sikh or anything doesn't matter. All of us have made a mess of Them by just disobeying. We have really disobeyed Them, because we have a freedom to disobey. We have molded Them as we liked!"<br>

Nāṇaka has created a Pan̄jā Sāhab they call it, or everywhere They have been able to create water. Whatever They touched, They could create water out of it.</font><br>
Water is the life, life force which sustains us. Without water we cannot live! The is the sustainance [sustenance].<br>

"Today I would like to say about this chakra especially that is the ... what we call the Nābhī chakra, is the central path of our evolution where you start your seeking and youge [you] cross over to [the] other side.<br>
Now, surrounding this you will find there is the Ocean of Illusion. And this Ocean of Illusion was governed by a Deity, by a special powerful personality whom we call as Dattātreya -- is the Primordial Master. And He incarnated on this Earth many a times. <font color="red">At the time of Christ, and even before that, He incarnated as, say, Abraham, Moses, Socrates, Lao Tze.</font> Later on, He incarnated as Muhammad Sāhab, then the same Great Principle incarnated as Nāṇaka, then the same Principle at the last incarnated as Sāī Nāth of Śhirḍī.<br>
So the same Great Principle of this Primordial Master has incarnated because without a master, how will you be taken away from in ... this illusion? How you are going to be exposed to that reality which you do not feel?<br>
What has to happen to you is that you have to become more sensitive, more open, awakened, enlightened to feel that's All-pervading Power around you.<br>
Now, these [masters] came again and again and told you that you must look after your dharma.<br>
Dharma doesn't mean any religion that is being established in the names of these people, because human beings know how to make a pickle out of everyone. They are great `experts'.<br>
All of Them in essence are one and the same.<br>
But like flowers on the same tree can be taken away from time to time and then when they become ugly and they become completely spoilt, then people can claim, `This is my flower,' `This is my flower.' Everybody has become a contractor of this thing.<br>
Actually these people belong to the whole universe, They are universal beings and They came on this Earth to give us a sustainance [sustenance] within us, a sustainance [sustenance].<br>
Dharma means a sustainance [sustenance], that is we can say, that is quality that is ... that is human."<br>

They are all related to each other, very closely, which you'll find out in Kuṇḍalinī also. It['s] very interesting how They are related, now They have played the game.

"<font color="red">Five hundred years before Christ [500 BC], the Great Master Socrates in this country told the whole world that, "We have to know ourselves." And He was wisdom personified. But He was killed. He didn't do any harm. He just told to everyone for their benevolence. He didn't live for Himself. And He lived for others. He did not take any ... any money from anyone, for His knowledge, nor ... nor did He punish anyone, but He was punished.</font><br>

She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā).

"The Brahmachaitanya (All-pervading Power) has Itself become very active as a new type of age called "Kṛita Yuga" has started. It is achieving results and producing miracles. It is not only talk or reading Scriptures, but it is actualization and the proof. Of course, all false people are afraid of facing the Truth, because Sahaja Yoga goes against their interests. They are challenging and opposing violently the spread of Sahaja Yoga. The Satya Yuga has to be established by the Sahaja Yogis. <font color="red">Now they are not alone like Christ our Lord, Muhammad the Prophet, Socrates the Philosopher or other Incarnations, Seers and realized Souls.</font> They are in thousands.

"<font color="red">A benevolent ruler, in the form of a philosopher king (as put forward by Socrates), is the ideal person to be the head of government.</font> Such a person must be an extremely wise, detached personality, without any desires for lust, power and money.

They discover very fast that power can give them prosperity and that this money power can whitewash and obliterate all their misdeeds and conceal the dubious business they are up to. Unfortunately for them, this false license has now gone into their heads, like a fixed idea, and they go on behaving immorally, without any fear of the Divine, ruthlessly destroying the entire value system of democracy. They may carry on for years, as they did in Italy, until, by the Law of Polarity or by Divine Retribution, they are exposed. But before this happens, such rulers unfortunately become models for the people whom they govern and gradually moral degradation in day-to-day life begins to create a decadent or dying democratic society."<br>
