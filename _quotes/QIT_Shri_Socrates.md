<font color="red">As soon as that stability is achieved, in Absolute Peace and Joy, you achieve that Witness State described by Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, by Jesus, by all the Scriptures whether by Zoroaster, Socrates, Confucius or any of Dattātreya's Incarnations.</font><br>

"So the dharma that has been established in us by God Almighty because if we want to go to the Kingdom of God, then in our freedom we must desire to get to God. If someone tries to pressurize us and says, 'You must ask for God,' then it is of no use, it is not an evaluation. That is why to reach in this state, a person has to seek the God as per his own independent sweet will and not due to any pressure, or any disease or any hardships or any sorrow, but only because of the fact and realizing that, 'It is the only motive of our life to seek God.'<br>

His birthday was celebrated the other day. And that day I was so very happy, you don't know, and it was extremely hot weather. Then I said ... I said, "All right, have any drops from flowers to the leaves," and they said, "Today is His birthday." And I was so happy today, all the time.<br>
'Was He the Incarnation of our sustainance [sustenance]?' 'And is He within us?'<br>
He looks after our sustainance [sustenance].<br>
He was not the property of Greeks, He was everybody's property which is within us, on this green Void, as you call it. He exists there.</font><br>
Ask such questions: these can be answered only on vibratory awareness.<br>
......<br>
They ... they want to, you see, even the Christ, even Christ, they don't think much of Him, they never thought much of Him. Now, I don't know what, they think because He's no more! What did you think of Him? You see, not one educated person went to Him, not one!<br>
[After 10 seconds:] <font color="red">As a person they don't think much of Socrates, now what to do?<br>
Every word that Socrates has said is Absolute Truth.<br>
And these are the human beings who, who are evaluating Him! What is your measure?</font><br>

"Apart from that, there is [a] third type of Incarnations which worked [pointing to the Void on the Chakra Chart:] in this gap: to sustain us. These are Ten Pri... Primordial Masters, the Ādi Guru. These people incarnated on this Earth to give us our sustainance [sustenance], our religion as they call it. They gave us those Ten Religions or sustainance [sustenance] which is important for a human being.<br>
This Principle of Primordial Master incarnated as Abraham, as Moses, as Muhammad Sāhab, as Janaka, as Nāṇaka, and recently, till recently, the One who is no more a now, is Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth.<br>
[During the translation helps with the enumeration:] Muh... mhh. <font color="red">Socrates.</font> Nāṇaka.<br>
Yes.<br>
<font color="red">Now, these people are Incarnation[s] of the one Principle, that is Primordial Master.<br> 
The energy or the power with which They work[ed] is either a sister or a daughter: is a very pure relationships.<br> 
If you read Their teachings you will find [that] They are saying the same things. Because They were worried about our sustainance [sustenance].</font>"<br>

"For example, we can say the gree... green thing is the one that represents the water, water element. This center the ... in the stomach is the water element within us. It is called as Nābhī chakra, and around it is called as the Bhavasāgara, you can say the Void, or you can say the Gap, or whatever you may say, the whole world as such, within us. So, the people who were born on this center, around this center, were born out of water element.<br>
<font color="red">In this Bhavasāgara -- oc... Bhavasāgara means the ocean of this world -- were born, through this ocean of the world, were born all the Primordial Masters, one after another. We can say Abraham, Moses, we had Janaka, were Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], and Socrates, and so many others like that, Nāṇaka, and also very recently, we had about hundred years back, a very great Saint born in India known as Sāī Nāth.<br>
They all represent the same element that is the water element. Being responsible or being born out of that, They are anxious to maintain water element as the one which is within us for sustaining ourselves. We su... we are sustained by water, so They help us to sustain ourselves. They are the sustainers: They tell us how to sustain us as a human being.<br>
And all of Them have tried to establish religion within us.</font><br>
A religion doesn't mean outside, but the religion as a man: means the capacity of a man, or you can say the quality of a man. What a human being should be like, what is the way to know if he is a human being or not, which is described in al... in the Ten Commandments."<br>

"But in the history of spirituality all over the world, we find there has been great contributions by people, who otherwise were very wise, very intelligent, and extremely generous people. They could not have been false. They could not have lied to us.<br>
<font color="red">For example let us take the case of Socrates. Socrates has told us that: 'We have to leave our body for the second life and that when we live on this world, when we live as human beings on this Earth, we have to keep ourselves in such a way that we do not spoil our being. That we have a sustainance [sustenance] within us, a quality that makes us human beings, by which we can be called as human beings.'</font><br>
What is the difference between human beings and animals?<br>
As so many others also have said the same thing: 'That we are human beings, because we are human beings we have to maintain a certain amount of sustainance [sustenance].'<br> 
<font color="red">After Socrates we had people like Abraham and Moses, They also said the same thing! There isn't much difference in what They said and Socrates had said.<br>
Socrates had said one a ... one more thing: 'That there are Deities within us, and we have to look after those Deities. We have to keep Them pleased.'</font><br>
Moses, when He found Ten Commandments, actually He found those Ten Methods by which He was telling us, that, 'We should be able to keep our existence as human being[s],' by following those Ten Commandments.<br>
Sustainance [sustenance] means the one we sustain within us. In Sanskrit knowl... language it is called as dharma. "Dhārayati [yena] sa dharmaḥ" [related to Mahābhārata 12.110.11]: the one which sustain[s] within ourselves.<br>
......<br>
To normalize you, all these Great Saints were born on this Earth, in this Void of the Big Primordial Being. And they exist within us, though they are not awakened as yet.<br>
We have had mainly Ten of Them. In India, we can call Them, from a very long time, as Ādināth, who was thousands of year[s] back. <font color="red">I have told you Socrates, Moses, Abraham, then Rāja Janaka.</font> Then we had, later on, Muhammad Sāhab, then Nāṇaka. Then the last, one of Them, was Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth. He was another Primordial Master, a great man.<br>
<font color="red">They are the Incarnations of the One Personality! They said the same thing and same thing and same thing: how to sustain yourself. Their job was not to give you Realization, but to sustain you: to make you capable of your Realization, to make you a proper recipient of God's blessings as realized Souls.</font><br>
If the pot is not all right, if it has all the holes in it, what's the use of pouring Ganges into it?<br>
<font color="red">So They clogged all the points, and said that, "This should not be done."</font><br>
But as we have made mess of everything, we have made mess of Them also. All of us! Whether you are English, Indians or this thing doesn't matter. Whether you are Christians, Muslims or a Sikh or anything doesn't matter. All of us have made a mess of Them by just disobeying. We have really disobeyed Them, because we have a freedom to disobey. We have molded Them as we liked!"<br>

But it happens: that a person who is more extrovert, always tries to go to something new. [Drinks water.] And when he tries to go to something new, he forgets that: 'There has been a tradition of that for ages! And why should we suddenly accept a new idea?'<br>
<font color="red">Confucius, Socrates, Abraham, Moses, later on Christ, all of Them have talked about the Spirit.</font><br>
Muhammad Sāhab has talked about the Kuṇḍalinī, calling It a 'Asas.<br>
And the word Kuṇḍalinī also is ... has a meaning that it is a coiled-up energy."<br>

"<font color="red">When they talked, say, about the flowers, say, they talked that they are Gods, like Socrates talked about Gods, like Confucius talked about Gods. When they talked, 'We have to please our Gods,' we started doubting. 'What Gods He's talking about?' Whatever They saw we could not see. All right.<br>
Then they thought, "No use talking about Gods. If you talk about Gods, then it becomes a, sort of a worship of something that is a flower. We talk about flower, then we think, 'We have become God.' And we talk about flower all the time!" "</font><br>

"Here [turning and pointing towards the Chakra Chart:] the Guru Tattwa is expressed in the Void, there, where the Ten Gurus actually incarnated basically and they re-incarnated. Say we can start uh-uh from Ādināth. Then we can come to ... other ones, uh-uh-uh ... like Nāṇaka, Janaka. Janaka was-ss much earlier. Then we can say Abraham, Moses-s-s. <font color="red">All these were Guru Tattwa, Socrates.</font> All these were Guru Tattwa people: the people who came as Prophets. The ones who came on this Earth to teach us balance, to teach us the Code of Life.<br>
That was also important part. But that was forgot[ten]!<br> 
'Why? Why the code? Why the religion?' Religion is for the ascent, to build you up."<br>

"If you go to a temple, every temple has got uh-uh-uh nice uh arrangement for you to get possessed. [Laughter.]<br>
Or even a church, or a mosque, where God has to reside, you find suddenly you get attacked. and you come out absolutely puzzled about yourself, ending up into lunatic asylums.<br>
So what sort of worshiping places are these, where you go to find God and you get the horrible satanic forces acting on you?<br>
<font color="red">That's why in the modern times, people have become so very confused. We do not find truth in anything: in any ideologies, any philosophies, anything that started, say, Confucius started humanism, Socrates started another thing, Muhammad Sāhab started another thing.</font><br>

"<font color="red">Five hundred years before Christ [500 BC], the Great Master Socrates in this country told the whole world that, "We have to know ourselves." And He was wisdom personified. But He was killed. He didn't do any harm. He just told to everyone for their benevolence. He didn't live for Himself. And He lived for others. He did not take any ... any money from anyone, for His knowledge, nor ... nor did He punish anyone, but He was punished.</font><br>

"The Primordial Master was also born as Macchindranāth, and again as Zoroaster who was worshiped by the ancient Persians, and still revered by Parsis. Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism. <font color="red">In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates.</font> He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā). Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918. Altogether there were ten major Avatāras of Dattātreya."<br>

"The Brahmachaitanya (All-pervading Power) has Itself become very active as a new type of age called "Kṛita Yuga" has started. It is achieving results and producing miracles. It is not only talk or reading Scriptures, but it is actualization and the proof. Of course, all false people are afraid of facing the Truth, because Sahaja Yoga goes against their interests. They are challenging and opposing violently the spread of Sahaja Yoga. The Satya Yuga has to be established by the Sahaja Yogis. <font color="red">Now they are not alone like Christ our Lord, Muhammad the Prophet, Socrates the Philosopher or other Incarnations, Seers and realized Souls.</font> They are in thousands. They are not in any way hampered by the few people who are trying to harm their collective progress. The Truth will be established and thus the dawn of Satya Yuga (the Kingdom of God) would be seen on the horizon. The message of Sahaja Yoga is that even these negative people have to accept the Truth and enjoy the blessings of the Divine Love."<br>

"<font color="red">A benevolent ruler, in the form of a philosopher king (as put forward by Socrates), is the ideal person to be the head of government.</font> Such a person must be an extremely wise, detached personality, without any desires for lust, power and money. There have been such persons in the recent past, people like Mahātmā Gāndhī, Atatürk Kemal Pasha, Anwar el-Sadat, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Ho Chi Minh, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, Dag Hammarksjöld, and Mujibur Rahman.<br>
......<br>
<font color="red">The Socratic ideal of serving the benevolence of the people, does not exist any more. On the contrary, they criticize it by insisting that Socrates was not a practical man. All the great Saints and Prophets were, of course, idealists and not practical people.</font> Most of the democracies of today's world are under the thumb of people who have no honorable or moral ideas whatsoever. They discover very fast that power can give them prosperity and that this money power can whitewash and obliterate all their misdeeds and conceal the dubious business they are up to. Unfortunately for them, this false license has now gone into their heads, like a fixed idea, and they go on behaving immorally, without any fear of the Divine, ruthlessly destroying the entire value system of democracy. They may carry on for years, as they did in Italy, until, by the Law of Polarity or by Divine Retribution, they are exposed. But before this happens, such rulers unfortunately become models for the people whom they govern and gradually moral degradation in day-to-day life begins to create a decadent or dying democratic society."<br>
