<font color="red">As soon as that stability is achieved, in Absolute Peace and Joy, you achieve that Witness State described by Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, by Jesus, by all the Scriptures whether by Zoroaster, Socrates, Confucius or any of Dattātreya's Incarnations.</font><br>

"So the dharma that has been established in us by God Almighty because if we want to go to the Kingdom of God, then in our freedom we must desire to get to God. If someone tries to pressurize us and says, 'You must ask for God,' then it is of no use, it is not an evaluation. That is why to reach in this state, a person has to seek the God as per his own independent sweet will and not due to any pressure, or any disease or any hardships or any sorrow, but only because of the fact and realizing that, 'It is the only motive of our life to seek God.'<br>

His birthday was celebrated the other day. And that day I was so very happy, you don't know, and it was extremely hot weather. Then I said ... I said, "All right, have any drops from flowers to the leaves," and they said, "Today is His birthday." And I was so happy today, all the time.<br>
'Was He the Incarnation of our sustainance [sustenance]?' 'And is He within us?'<br>
He looks after our sustainance [sustenance].<br>
He was not the property of Greeks, He was everybody's property which is within us, on this green Void, as you call it. He exists there.</font><br>

They ... they want to, you see, even the Christ, even Christ, they don't think much of Him, they never thought much of Him. Now, I don't know what, they think because He's no more! What did you think of Him? You see, not one educated person went to Him, not one!<br>

"Apart from that, there is [a] third type of Incarnations which worked [pointing to the Void on the Chakra Chart:] in this gap: to sustain us. These are Ten Pri... Primordial Masters, the Ādi Guru. These people incarnated on this Earth to give us our sustainance [sustenance], our religion as they call it. They gave us those Ten Religions or sustainance [sustenance] which is important for a human being.<br>
This Principle of Primordial Master incarnated as Abraham, as Moses, as Muhammad Sāhab, as Janaka, as Nāṇaka, and recently, till recently, the One who is no more a now, is Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth.<br>
[During the translation helps with the enumeration:] Muh... mhh. <font color="red">Socrates.</font> Nāṇaka.<br>
Yes.<br>
<font color="red">Now, these people are Incarnation[s] of the one Principle, that is Primordial Master.<br> 
The energy or the power with which They work[ed] is either a sister or a daughter: is a very pure relationships.<br> 
If you read Their teachings you will find [that] They are saying the same things. Because They were worried about our sustainance [sustenance].</font>"<br>

"For example, we can say the gree... green thing is the one that represents the water, water element. This center the ... in the stomach is the water element within us. It is called as Nābhī chakra, and around it is called as the Bhavasāgara, you can say the Void, or you can say the Gap, or whatever you may say, the whole world as such, within us. So, the people who were born on this center, around this center, were born out of water element.<br>
<font color="red">In this Bhavasāgara -- oc... Bhavasāgara means the ocean of this world -- were born, through this ocean of the world, were born all the Primordial Masters, one after another. We can say Abraham, Moses, we had Janaka, were Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], and Socrates, and so many others like that, Nāṇaka, and also very recently, we had about hundred years back, a very great Saint born in India known as Sāī Nāth.<br>
They all represent the same element that is the water element. Being responsible or being born out of that, They are anxious to maintain water element as the one which is within us for sustaining ourselves. We su... we are sustained by water, so They help us to sustain ourselves. They are the sustainers: They tell us how to sustain us as a human being.<br>
And all of Them have tried to establish religion within us.</font><br>
A religion doesn't mean outside, but the religion as a man: means the capacity of a man, or you can say the quality of a man. What a human being should be like, what is the way to know if he is a human being or not, which is described in al... in the Ten Commandments."<br>

"But in the history of spirituality all over the world, we find there has been great contributions by people, who otherwise were very wise, very intelligent, and extremely generous people. They could not have been false. They could not have lied to us.<br>
<font color="red">For example let us take the case of Socrates. Socrates has told us that: 'We have to leave our body for the second life and that when we live on this world, when we live as human beings on this Earth, we have to keep ourselves in such a way that we do not spoil our being. That we have a sustainance [sustenance] within us, a quality that makes us human beings, by which we can be called as human beings.'</font><br>
What is the difference between human beings and animals?<br>
As so many others also have said the same thing: 'That we are human beings, because we are human beings we have to maintain a certain amount of sustainance [sustenance].'<br> 
<font color="red">After Socrates we had people like Abraham and Moses, They also said the same thing! There isn't much difference in what They said and Socrates had said.<br>
Socrates had said one a ... one more thing: 'That there are Deities within us, and we have to look after those Deities. We have to keep Them pleased.'</font><br>
Moses, when He found Ten Commandments, actually He found those Ten Methods by which He was telling us, that, 'We should be able to keep our existence as human being[s],' by following those Ten Commandments.<br>
Sustainance [sustenance] means the one we sustain within us. In Sanskrit knowl... language it is called as dharma. "Dhārayati [yena] sa dharmaḥ" [related to Mahābhārata 12.110.11]: the one which sustain[s] within ourselves.<br>
......<br>
To normalize you, all these Great Saints were born on this Earth, in this Void of the Big Primordial Being. And they exist within us, though they are not awakened as yet.<br>
We have had mainly Ten of Them. In India, we can call Them, from a very long time, as Ādināth, who was thousands of year[s] back. <font color="red">I have told you Socrates, Moses, Abraham, then Rāja Janaka.</font> Then we had, later on, Muhammad Sāhab, then Nāṇaka. Then the last, one of Them, was Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth. He was another Primordial Master, a great man.<br>
<font color="red">They are the Incarnations of the One Personality! They said the same thing and same thing and same thing: how to sustain yourself. Their job was not to give you Realization, but to sustain you: to make you capable of your Realization, to make you a proper recipient of God's blessings as realized Souls.</font><br>
If the pot is not all right, if it has all the holes in it, what's the use of pouring Ganges into it?<br>
<font color="red">So They clogged all the points, and said that, "This should not be done."</font><br>
But as we have made mess of everything, we have made mess of Them also. All of us! Whether you are English, Indians or this thing doesn't matter. Whether you are Christians, Muslims or a Sikh or anything doesn't matter. All of us have made a mess of Them by just disobeying. We have really disobeyed Them, because we have a freedom to disobey. We have molded Them as we liked!"<br>

Nāṇaka has created a Pan̄jā Sāhab they call it, or everywhere They have been able to create water. Whatever They touched, They could create water out of it.</font><br>
Water is the life, life force which sustains us. Without water we cannot live! The is the sustainance [sustenance].<br>

One of them is Śhrī Rām. Śhrī Rām resides on the right Heart and is the Father. He is the Father and He is the Fatherhood.

To such an extent He went, that He had to sacrifice His own wife for the sake of His own state. He did that! And He had to ask His wife, who was pregnant, to go and live with a very great Sage. One may say that, 'What was He ... what was He doing about His wife?' She was the Goddess. She was so remarkable that He was not bothered about Her. He was so sure of Her Powers that He did it!

Then he went back and he was very sick. His wife said, "Now, what is there? After all, you see, we became Muslims because our parents were Muslims. And they told us that, 'Muhammad Sāhab was the last.' After all you are to be saved."<br>
Then he came and he said, "All right, Mother, whatever You say, I'm going to say." I said, "Now you pray to Nāṇak Sāhab, instead of Muhammad Sāhab, because it is Muhammad Sāhab who is angry with you."<br>

"[Pointing down from Viśhuddhi chakra to Nābhī chakra on the Chakra Chart:] The connection is that this seeking [slowly makes three and a half clockwise circles inside the Void around the Nābhī chakra on the Chakra Chart:] goes in developing and there are Ten Principles which are described as the Ten Commandments, you can say, or we have got Ten Sūtras is, in Sanskrit language they are called as Ten Sūtras.<br>

But there are Ten, which are here, which are described as [the] Ten Commandments in the Bible.<br>
<font color="red">And [doing a clockwise bandhan from right top to bottom and to left top inside the Void on the Chakra Chart:] these are the Ten Primordial Masters who were born on this Earth. Say we can start from Socrates, then we can think of other, in India was Dattātreya, is the ... Dattātreya is the essence, and He is born as Socrates, He is born as Lao Tze, He is born as Abraham, as Moses, He is born as, up till now we can say, Muhammad Sāhab, Nāṇaka, latest is the Sāī Nāth of Śhirḍī.</font> He is the One who [pointing with one more circle inside the Void on the Chakra Chart:] represents, They all represent, this Primordial Master's Principle of Religion."<br>

"Today I would like to say about this chakra especially that is the ... what we call the Nābhī chakra, is the central path of our evolution where you start your seeking and youge [you] cross over to [the] other side.<br>
Now, surrounding this you will find there is the Ocean of Illusion. And this Ocean of Illusion was governed by a Deity, by a special powerful personality whom we call as Dattātreya -- is the Primordial Master. And He incarnated on this Earth many a times. <font color="red">At the time of Christ, and even before that, He incarnated as, say, Abraham, Moses, Socrates, Lao Tze.</font> Later on, He incarnated as Muhammad Sāhab, then the same Great Principle incarnated as Nāṇaka, then the same Principle at the last incarnated as Sāī Nāth of Śhirḍī.<br>
So the same Great Principle of this Primordial Master has incarnated because without a master, how will you be taken away from in ... this illusion? How you are going to be exposed to that reality which you do not feel?<br>
What has to happen to you is that you have to become more sensitive, more open, awakened, enlightened to feel that's All-pervading Power around you.<br>
Now, these [masters] came again and again and told you that you must look after your dharma.<br>
Dharma doesn't mean any religion that is being established in the names of these people, because human beings know how to make a pickle out of everyone. They are great 'experts'.<br>
All of Them in essence are one and the same.<br>
But like flowers on the same tree can be taken away from time to time and then when they become ugly and they become completely spoilt, then people can claim, 'This is my flower,' 'This is my flower.' Everybody has become a contractor of this thing.<br>
Actually these people belong to the whole universe, They are universal beings and They came on this Earth to give us a sustainance [sustenance] within us, a sustainance [sustenance].<br>
Dharma means a sustainance [sustenance], that is we can say, that is quality that is ... that is human."<br>

They are all related to each other, very closely, which you'll find out in Kuṇḍalinī also. It['s] very interesting how They are related, now They have played the game.

As a human being, you have to have a sustainance [sustenance], and this is the center that gradually unfolds the sustainance [sustenance] from animal to higher animals and to human stage, where a person starts realizing that these sustenances exist within us.

But all the Great Incarnations who came in this tradition of spirituality, one by one manifested, every time, a new awareness in the human dimension.<br>
In the ancient time when they followed Patañjali Yoga, that time, they were hardly one or two people whom Realization was given. Like Rāja Janaka gave Realization to one person, who was the father-in-law of Śhrī Rām.<br>

Like a boy gets a lot of money, say from his parents, he uses that, and then builds up his own business. Very rarely he'll throw away all that, and start something new venture and end up into bankruptcy.<br>

Like I was in Pune the other day, and I met some very learned Sanskrit scholars. And I was amazed: that they all were suffering from all kinds of diseases of a very serious nature. They said we have a guru, another said he had a guru. I said, "How is it you are suffering from disease? If you have a guru at least your health should be all right, at least minimum of minimum." "Oh," they said, "no! This is something we are doing very ... uh serious work." "What is that?" They started giving Me names: aruṇopāy, tar[u]ṇopāy, this, that. Buthey said: that, "Our guru gives us a śhaktipāt." I said, "What is all that? I have never heard [about] it. In what book have you found it? Is it in Vedas? Is it in Purāṇas? Is it in the Gītā? Or is it in the Bible or Qur'ān, where is it? <font color="red">Did Lao Tze talk about it or Socrates?</font> From where do you get this word śhaktipāt suddenly? I've never heard about it." So they said about sixty, seventy years back there was a gentleman called Viṣhṇu Tīrth, he has written a book, a book, and all this is based on that śhaktipāt business. I said, "I've never heard of this Viṣhṇu Tīrth."<br>
And he started a new fad. And this fad you have accepted! Paying no attention to what Gītā has to say, no attention to what Vedas have to say, no attention to what other Scriptures have to say about your ascent. You accepted this gentleman out of the blue.<br>

And when you come to Sahaja Yoga, you will be amazed to know: that a new light is thrown in their lives and in the Real Religion.<br>
By just talking about them you cannot believe into such things.<br>
But when you get these Divine Vibrations, you ask the question. And when that is the truth, you start feeling the Cool Breeze flowing into your hands, and you'd know that that's the truth. Because this new awareness has not come in you, that's why you cannot definitely say that, 'This is this.'<br>
It's everything relative at this stage. But at the stage where you become the Spirit, It being absolute, you get Absolute Knowledge.<br>

All other scriptures also. I mean, what they are saying is absolutely true, that you have to be righteous, you have to be above vi[o]lence, you have to be detached. 
All these things are absolutely the same, no doubt. There's no change. In all these Scriptures they say the same thing. <font color="red">This was said about eight thousand] [8,000] years back by Śhrī Rāma, then by Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, then it was said by Socrates, Lao Tze, Abraham. All of Them have said the same thing.</font> Then Muhammad Sāhab said the same thing, Nāṇaka said the same thing."<br>

"<font color="red">Those who were Saints, in any country, take it Lao Tze, you can take from Socrates onward this side, Muhammad Sāhab, Nāṇak Sāhab, all of these people, you will be amazed to find that all these people behaved in such a manner that we cannot find faults with them. I mean if you want to find, you may with your ignorance. But the kind of life if They led, how is it that They were like that? What was so great? It was Their Divinity which expressed.</font><br>
While we all have this Divinity within ourselves, we have all these powers within ourselves, only thing: we have to use those powers, we have to manifest them. And for that manifestation, is ... is important that we have to become self-realized, in the sense that you have to get your Second Birth. <br>
......<br>
This-s old science is not only from India. It comes from everywhere. <font color="red">As I told you Confucius knew this, Socrates knew this, and, also, many people like William Blake and C.S. Lewis, all these people knew about it.</font><br>
But nobody could put it through to people because, I think, people did not want to accept it."<br>

[Śhrī Rām was the ideal husband where as Śhrī Sītājī was an ideal wife and the children born to them, known as Lav and Kuśha, were also the ideal sons.

"But if there was one Saint, all the people got after that Saint. If there was one Christ, they got after Him, they crucified Him. Anybody who talked of Truth had suffered. <font color="red">Socrates was given poison.</font><br>
So you have seen the history only all such things were happening. Because they were singled out, they were single people.<br>
But now, thousands can get their Self-realization, thousands can become Saints.<br>
Is such a collective power. It's such a great association which is so subtle and so much one. This is the love which is collective.<br>
This collective love we have never felt. We have never known this collective love. At the slightest pretext, a brother will fight another brother, the father will fight the mother, all kinds of things will go on.<br>
But, once you get collectively connected, you become like drops in the ocean, but actually become the ocean.<br>

"The Primordial Master was also born as Macchindranāth, and again as Zoroaster who was worshiped by the ancient Persians, and still revered by Parsis. Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism. <font color="red">In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates.</font> He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā). Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918. Altogether there were ten major Avatāras of Dattātreya."<br>

"The Brahmachaitanya (All-pervading Power) has Itself become very active as a new type of age called "Kṛita Yuga" has started. It is achieving results and producing miracles. It is not only talk or reading Scriptures, but it is actualization and the proof. Of course, all false people are afraid of facing the Truth, because Sahaja Yoga goes against their interests. They are challenging and opposing violently the spread of Sahaja Yoga. The Satya Yuga has to be established by the Sahaja Yogis. <font color="red">Now they are not alone like Christ our Lord, Muhammad the Prophet, Socrates the Philosopher or other Incarnations, Seers and realized Souls.</font> They are in thousands. They are not in any way hampered by the few people who are trying to harm their collective progress. The Truth will be established and thus the dawn of Satya Yuga (the Kingdom of God) would be seen on the horizon. The message of Sahaja Yoga is that even these negative people have to accept the Truth and enjoy the blessings of the Divine Love."<br>

"<font color="red">A benevolent ruler, in the form of a philosopher king (as put forward by Socrates), is the ideal person to be the head of government.</font> Such a person must be an extremely wise, detached personality, without any desires for lust, power and money. There have been such persons in the recent past, people like Mahātmā Gāndhī, Atatürk Kemal Pasha, Anwar el-Sadat, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Ho Chi Minh, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, Dag Hammarksjöld, and Mujibur Rahman.<br>
......<br>
<font color="red">The Socratic ideal of serving the benevolence of the people, does not exist any more. On the contrary, they criticize it by insisting that Socrates was not a practical man. All the great Saints and Prophets were, of course, idealists and not practical people.</font> Most of the democracies of today's world are under the thumb of people who have no honorable or moral ideas whatsoever. They discover very fast that power can give them prosperity and that this money power can whitewash and obliterate all their misdeeds and conceal the dubious business they are up to. Unfortunately for them, this false license has now gone into their heads, like a fixed idea, and they go on behaving immorally, without any fear of the Divine, ruthlessly destroying the entire value system of democracy. They may carry on for years, as they did in Italy, until, by the Law of Polarity or by Divine Retribution, they are exposed. But before this happens, such rulers unfortunately become models for the people whom they govern and gradually moral degradation in day-to-day life begins to create a decadent or dying democratic society."<br>
