<font color="red">"References to Kuṇḍalinī awakening abound in many of the Indian Scriptures. Some of these are Vāsiṣhṭha Yoga, Ṛigveda, Puruṣha Sūkta, Upaniṣhads of Atharvaveda, Yogopanishad, Yogaśhikhā Upaniṣhad, Kaṭhopaniṣhad and Yoga Kuṇḍalinī Upaniṣhad. In the Purāṇas are Devī Bhāgavat[am] Purāṇa, Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa, Śhrī Bhāgavat[a] Purāṇa, etc. In Sanhitas: Haṭh[a] Yoga Sanhita, Laya Yoga Sanhita, Rāj Yoga Sanhita, Śhiv Sanhita. In the Yoga tests: Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā, Saundaryalaharī, Śhubhodayam, Lalitā Sahasrānam, and by Saints such as Bhakt Kabīr, Nāṇak, Gyāneśhwar, etc."</font><br>

<font color="red">"But amongst all these, the middle path was that of sahaja Kuṇḍalinī awakening and Nāth Pānthis used to follow this. All this knowledge is scripted in Sanskrit language and all discussions were also done in same language.<br>
On this matter, in twelfth century Gyāneśhwarjī requested His elder brother [who was His Guru too] for His permission to write about this power within us in His book Gyāneśhwarī, the power which gives us our Self-realization, as nobody had clearly documented this before. When His Guru granted permission, He narrated about Kuṇḍalinī very clearly in sixth chapter of His book."</font><br>

<font color="red">"Just yesterday a person was arguing with Me about Gyāneśhwarī. If Gyāneśhwara was here we could ask Him today. He too was trying to find a way on how to explain it. But He could not do it as He died at a very young age.<br>
Because of many people dying before their [due] time a lot of misunderstanding has spread in the world."</font><br>

<font color="red">"The best example of this is Śhrī Gyāneśhwara: when His Kuṇḍalinī was awakened He wrote the sixth chapter, then He got His awakening. And when He was realized, by that time His Gyāneśhwarī was completed, that time He took to Samādhi. "</font><br>

<b>Version 1:</b><br>
<font color="red">"One gentleman was asking Me yesterday that, "What madness possessed a pundit like Gyāneśhwar to sing the praise of Śhrī Gaṇeśha? It is surprising that You consider Gyāneśhwar as a great pundit. Do You consider Him a pundit because He has made skillful use of words?"<br>
These Scriptures have been written by people who were born on a very high level. Their consciousness was much higher than ours and their vision was directed at something else altogether."</font><br>
<br>
<b>Version 2:</b><br>
<font color="red">"One gentleman was telling Me yesterday that, "What stupidity made a saint like Gyāneśhwar write praise [stuti] about Lord Gaṇeśha? You consider Gyāneśhwarjī a Saint, this in itself is a big surprise. Do you consider Him a Saint because of His śhabda chāturya [skill of writing]?"<br>
In these Scriptures whatever is written, it has been written by those people who were born at a very high state, whose vibratory level was very high, whose chakṣhu [eye, vision] was something different."</font><br>
<br>
<b>Version 3:</b><br>
<font color="red">"Yesterday, someone was telling Me that, "Sant Gyāneśhwar was such an intelligent man, and what foolishness that He used to praise Lord Gaṇeśha." You think that Gyāneśhwarjī was intelligent, this, itself is surprising. Do you consider Him intelligent because of His knowledge of words?<br>
Whatever is written in the Scriptures is written by those who were born as higher beings. Their attention was much higher. They had a different eye to see things."</font><br>

<font color="red">"This type of an organization [doubt] keeps going on. Even if it is the Age of Jesus Christ, even if it is the Age of Gyāneśhwarjī, even if it is the Age of Śhaṅkarāchārya, Age of Zartosht [Zoraster in Urdu], these people who think of themselves as special and overly smart (ati śhahāṇe), think of themselves to be special type, think themselves as very high scholarly, have always been there and will be there. They will all the time do these kind of true barricades (āḍ aṇge) and there are precious moments of life, those they will spend in this only. They don't have any treatment (ilāj)."</font> [<b> Variant:</b> <font color="red">"A doubt of this type lingers on, whether it is during the period of Christ, Gyāneśhwar, Śhaṅkarāchārya or Zartosht. Anytime! Those who think they are very helpful, special people, those who think they are scholars existed and will always be there. They will always create obstacles and spend priceless moments in such activity. There is no cure for it."</font>]<br>

But if you tell, that, 'Dyaneśhwar has explained that we have Kuṇḍalinī power within us, you respectfully call Him as Mā'ūlī and take out religious processions and diṇḍīs [parades] in His name but you must first read what has been written by Him.<br>
Now why has it been told to you that, 'You should not read the sixth chapter'?

<font color="red">"But in the twelfth century, Gyānadeva, Gyāneśhwara, who was another Nāth Pānthi, His Guru was His own brother, He ... asked the permission, from His brother, that, "Please allow Me to say all these things openly. At least to say in Marathi language, because the common people don't know anything about this knowledge." So He allowed Him, and He wrote the sixth chapter of Gyāneśhwarī in which He described Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
But it was in the twelfth century.<br>
After that, many Saints described, talked about him [It].<br>
Where we went yesterday, to Sātārā, you know that's the place where Śhrī Rāmadāsa lived.<br>
He said that, "Kuṇḍalinī"" -- they asked, somebody asked:  "How much time does it take to raise the Kuṇḍalinī?" He said, "That Tatk-ṣhaṇa." Means, "That moment." "But the person who wants to take it should be deserving, and the one who wants to give should be capable."<br>
[As a Sahaja Yogi starts laughing:] It's a big condition. This is such a big if, capital If I tell you. [Laughs.]<br>
As a result, very, very few people got their Realization. And those who were born as realized Souls, found ... found it impossible to talk to people.<br>

Permit Me that much." And then in His book Gyāneśhwarī, He wrote the sixth chapter about Kuṇḍalinī, that, "This is the power that gives us the Self-realization."<br>
Of course, He wrote another beautiful book, called Amṛutānubhava, where He has described what happens after Self-realization."</font><br>

<font color="red">"The writings of these great enlightened souls are mostly in Sanskrit and were not available to the general public. Whenever translated they were not even mentioning Kuṇḍalinī awakening as the only way to achieve Self-realization. It was completely deleted when translated. It was in the twelfth century that a Great Incarnation of a Saint, Śhrī Gyāneśhwara (God of Knowledge) was born. He live[d] for only twenty-three years. They were three brothers and one sister. All of them were tortured by the dharma-mārtaṇḍas. Gyāneśhwara took the permission of His Guru (Master), who was His eldest brother, and wrote in the regional language a book called Gyāneśhwarī. In the sixth chapter He clearly wrote about Kuṇḍalinī but again the people in charge of religion (dharma-mārtaṇḍas) said that this chapter was not allowed to be read (niṣhiddha)."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="red">"Then came, in the Twelfth Century, a great Saint called Gyāneśhwara in Maharashtra. It was a tradition of his time that one Master of Nāth Pānthis could give Realization only to one disciple. This Master was not supposed even to talk about the fourth dimension to normal people. They were only told that they should remember God and should sing the praise of God. But He, the great poet and a very great Saint, Gyāneśhwara, felt that it was time that the subject of spiritual ascent should be made much more clear to people.<br>
In Gītā there is no description of the Kuṇḍalinī or of the awakening, though Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, at the very outset, has said that a person should achieve the state of Sthitapragñya, which means, the one who is balanced, through enlightenment by Divine Knowledge. All this was a description, but he did not talk about how it is brought about.<br>
It was Śhrī Gyāneśhwara who wrote a treatise on Gītā called as Gyāneśhwarī. In the sixth chapter he very sweetly described the nature of this fourth power, called the Kuṇḍalinī which rests in the triangular bone and the way it is awakened by some great Soul by which one gets his fourth state of awareness. He did not take permission from his guru to give Realization to others but he only asked that he should be permitted at least to write about it. Later on, this sixth chapter was not understood by the people who were in charge of religion (dharma-mārtaṇḍas). They said that this sixth chapter was not to be read (niṣhiddha) and thus this great chapter was completely neglected by the people and they just tried to follow the path of bhakti, which means devotion to God by chanting the names of God or singing the praise of God Almighty.<br>
There were three types of movements in our country. In the first one, people wanted to know about matter, the origin of matter, the origin of this world. In this quest they came to know how our right side is built up and what the elements that build our body are. The advancement on this knowledge led to science as a new field of study. Another aspect was constituted by people who were absolutely dedicated and were singing the praise of all Deities who were created by Mother Earth (Swayambhu). They sang praise of God and prayed to God Almighty in the way their gurus told them. There were also people in the middle path who were called the Nāth Pānthis, specially in Maharashtra. These were realized Souls who had received their Realization through the "one guru, one disciple" principle. Saint Gyāneśhwara was also from the Nāth Sampradāya, meaning the Nāth Cult. He was a great exponent of Kuṇḍalinī awakening in his book."</font><br>
