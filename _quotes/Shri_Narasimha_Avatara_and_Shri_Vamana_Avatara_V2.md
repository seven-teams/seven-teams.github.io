Please find attached the pdf file <font color="blue">Shri_Narasimha_Avatara.pdf</font> obtained by searching for Śhrī <font color="red">Narasiṃh</font>.   

Please also find attached the pdf file <font color="blue">Shri_Vamana_Avatara_V2.pdf</font> which contains quotes from 6 talks of Śhrī Mātājī (the prior version sent out in December 2014 had quotes from only 4 talks).

If by chance extra quotes on <font color="red">Śhrī Narasiṃha</font> or <font color="red">Śhrī Vāmana</font> are found out, please kindly share them with all of us. Please share the files with all our brothers and sisters.

Jay Śhrī Mātājī!
