That way the Pūjā is done by heart. That time waves after waves of joy start flowing because when Ātmā Tattwa is the focal point there can not be any thoughts. The way people fill wine in a glass, same is with you performing Pūjā, your śhraddhā is the wine and the glass is nothing but the recitation of mantras and sādhana. While drinking this wine you are completely engrossed, with no thoughts, and you swim in this joy. How to express that joy in thoughts [words]? The wine which is inside the stomach, who is going to pour it back into a glass? And that too in an inferior glass made of thoughts. Joy after drinking this wine is eternal. It is your wealth. Many Pūjās like this have happened in front of Me and every time a big wave comes and takes you to a new shore. Those experiences from different shores become your own. They give grandness to your personality and open new doors of joy.<br /> It is best to do a Pūjā in the heart. If you can look at the Photo and then bring it into your heart, or after a Pūjā if you can bring that scene into your heart, then the joy of that moment can become permanent and will last for a long time. Read this letter to all Sahaja Yogis and send them copies of this letter."<br /> <br /> <b>Version 2:</b><br /> "You should say the Mantras in Pūjā but with great faith (śhraddhā). <font color="DarkRed">There is no alternative to śhraddhā.</font> You should perform the Pūjā when śhraddhā grows deep, so that heart itself gets all Pūjā performed. At that time waves of bliss start flowing because it is the Spirit that is saying, how can any thought come at that time? People pour their wine in the glass. Your Pūjā is like that. In that, wine is your faith and the glass is the recitation of Mantras and the worshiping. When you are drinking that wine forgetting everything, how can a thought come! Then only bathing in the Ocean of Bliss! How can that joy be expressed in thoughts? Who will pour that wine, back in the glass, which is to be drunk and that too in the inferior glass of thoughts? However, the joy that you get after drinking the wine is eternal and ever-present. It becomes your asset. Many such Pūjās have been performed in My presence. Every time a big wave comes and take you to a new land. Experiences of many such lands become your own. They give vastness to personality and open new gates of joy.<br /> Best is worshiping in the heart. If, the Photo by looking at it, can be placed in heart or, after the Pūjā, its view goes to heart, then the joy which you get only at that time, can become everlasting and ever-present.

I call the fraternity of the bhūts, not collectivity. Always, all the useless Sahaja Yogis will form a group, and will have a very strong objection to everything that is sensible. And they will have suggestions for everything.<br /> There has to be no suggestions at all. There are no alternatives, because Śhiva is absolute. Once what He said is said! You just do it and see, that's the best. Alternatives will be second best or third best or maybe useless. But there is no alternative for Śhiva Tattwa.<br /> I'll give an example, I told Delhi people that, "You organize, say, program for seven days outside with other people." It was sensible because I knew it was to rain. At ... it has to rain also. Rain can be stopped, but it was to rain for all the other villagers, you see. We cannot stop them for only Sahaja Yogis, can we? Of course, Sahaja Yogis are important, so I said, "Let them be with other Sahaja Yogis." Now they started an alternative, only thinking that, 'You see, they won't be comfortable and ...' I mean it was good, but on a no ... other level that, 'They will not be comfortable with Sahaja Yogi,' another level.<br /> ......<br /> So all these ideas of giving alternatives at the mental level is also wrong.<br /> I give any ... anything I say, immediately there will be ten suggestions. I try all these tricks with you. Because you are used to conferences, you see. [Laughter, laughs.] So I said, "All right, Subramanian [from New Delhi], what do you have to say about it?" [Laughter, smiles.] Because, after all, Lord Subramanian['s] mind is there, must ask him. Then I ask Venugopalan [from New Delhi], then I'll ask Gavin [Brown], Warren [Reeves], all these people. "Now what do you have to say?" And then they give their suggestion[s].<br /> But, if you see, in the conference of all the Divine Deities, there is no suggestion, no suggestion, no alternative. No alternatives to your Mother's ideas, nothing. Absolute, it's absolute. Nobody gives any suggestions to Me, never. No question. They won't listen to you, They won't listen to anyone. There's no question. Such harmony, complete obedience. And not only, They are fixed with Their qualities. They are told that you have to do it, They'll do it. [Snaps Her palms.] This is the difference.<br /> ......<br /> Every time you do something, I tell you something, is just for you to learn something. I don't have to learn anything. Do you thinks that way, that I have to learn something now anymore? Not. So you have to learn something.<br /> And that is what if you understand, then a kind of a detachment will build in you and a surrender. You will be amazed your ... [you will] be so much relieved of nonsensical headaches that you have and the burdens you carry if you understand that, 'The whole joke, the whole work, the whole drama is done by Mother, on I am just playing into it.' There's so simple. That is to be felt, to be understood.<br /> And the enjoyment lies in that. Not in judging or finding alternatives. You try! Those who have tried it have enjoyed it very much."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1983-0211 Śhivarātri Pūjā (English + Hindi), Śhiva Tattwa within Us and No Alternatives to Your Mother's Ideas, Universal Sahaja Yoga Temple, Āśhram, 78 Kṛiṣhṇa Nagar, Safdarjung Enclave, New Delhi, India</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> "So, you have to be under complete obedience of the Divine. Which is: one cannot understand sometimes that how to be like that, because we have not been brought up that way. We don't know how to do it and it's very difficult.<br /> So many people say, "Mother, it is very difficult to surrender." Is not that they don't want to surrender. <font color="DarkRed">But they say, think that, 'We are still, you see, popping up somewhere. Mother says something but we start questioning Her. Mother says this, then mm we think that we should, mm-mm mm we can suggest to Mother there's another alternative and this and that.'<br /> But there is no alternative. You see, there's no alternative for a person who is a sensible person.</font><br /> If he knows that Divine is only thinking of your hita, of your well-being, and whatever It sees and does, you see, knows much more than you do, much, much more. And in so many dimensions that, if somebody says so that, 'Do like this,' best is to do like [that].<br /> Sometimes it shocks people.<br /> People have ideas about sympathies, ideas about being, you see, kind to others and to be compa-ssionate to others. But what is a human compassion? He doesn't do anything, he just talks!<br /> While the God's compassion works! It works! It works on people. It doesn't talk that, 'Oh, I am very compassionate! I am full of compassion!', nothing. It just works, it manifests itself.<br /> So, one should understand: to be a complete egoless personality, one should try to obey the Self within yourself.<br /> Now how do you obey your Self within yourself? It is through vibratory awareness. Try to obey through your vibratory awareness. Any question you want to ask, anything you want to do, you must obey it through your vibratory awareness.<br /> Now some people are not so sensitive, that's true. The reason why they are not sensitive is because they think about it.<br /> Now you think with your brain, all right? If your brain can be enlightened, then you will think as the Divine thinks and your sensitivity will improve, because sensitivity comes from the central nervous system. Now, in the central nervous system, if there is any blockage it is actually in the brain, because all the centers are represented in the brain.<br /> So, the best thing is to say that, 'Mother, come in my brain. Please reside in my brain. Please make Your room in this brain. You be the controller of this brain. Let this brain be guided by Your Divine Wisdom.' And you don't think for yourself.<br /> And this word 'I think' should be dropped completely from Sahaja Yogi[s]. 'I think' means, goes on, you see, funny ways. It can be anything, you see.<br /> Like once we went out and we had one of My very stupid uh-uh-uh relations staying with us, a girl. And the, as I was going out, we had no servants that day, so I, I was cooking, but that day when we were going out so I tell her, "I'm going in the morning, can you make a little bit of khichaṛī for us? When we come back we'll have that."<br /> That's the only cooking she did in her lifetime, maybe she did not do [that] also.<br /> So [laughing:] when we came back, uh-uh-uh-uh she told Me that she has not cooked. So I said, "Why? Why didn't you cook? Because we were supposed to take our food here." She said, "I, I thought that maybe you may not come, maybe you're not hungry, maybe you may not like to eat, maybe I may not do well." <font color="DarkRed">You see, it's all these four alternatives not to do the cooking.</font> But I said, "Why didn't you think, that we may be hungry [laughter], that we will eat? Why didn't you think this way?"<br /> But, "I thought." You see, this is an explanation for uh not having one in the brain, I should say, that there is no Divine uh Guidance in the brain. Then the guidance comes from your ego or from your superego, which said, 'I, I thought that this might happen.' But to how, why, why did you think like that? I ... why not the other way round? Why didn't you think the other way round?<br /> But that is how it is.<br /> <font color="DarkRed">And when these things happen, we really are so much used to this kind of justification and alternative-s to be offered, that this becomes again the habit of the brain, and the brain gets separated from the Divine.</font><br /> So, you tell your brain, 'But, but why? Why did you think like that? Now will you stop thinking about these things in, on these lines? Let us think of the positive thinking.'<br /> Now positive thinking is nothing but is a thinking, as according to Sahaja Yoga, is not aggressive thinking, but it means that a thinking which helps to manifest the Divine. That is what is positive thinking. And the ... and the ...<br /> [Aside:] It's all right, you see.<br /> And, and the result of that is that: your nerves start opening out, and you start feeling the-eh ... feeling the manifestations of Divine Power in your fingers, in your being.<br /> And this is the basic thing that doesn't happen in the West or in the Western culture, because we have a very big idea of always giving an explanation for anything."<br /> ......<br /> So, one should not be extremely uh on the thought waves and on the depending on their thinking. Because, you see, thinking has an alternative. Thinking always has an alternative.<br /> <font color="DarkRed">You can say, 'I was thinking this,' or, 'I was thinking that.' But whom are you blaming? It was you who were thinking so you are responsible for that. So, if you take the responsibility for your thinking, then you may not do such a thing as to say that, 'I thought, if I had done this thing it would have been.' Because you are responsible for your thinking!</font><br /> Supposing an engine driver decides that, 'I thought I better go by [laughing:] the other route,' and had a big accident [some laughter]. People will ask him, 'Why did you think like that? What was the thing that made you think like that?'<br /> But in everything day-to-day life I find human beings are always saying, 'I think,' 'I think,' 'I think,' all the time giving alternatives. And that's why they go up and down, up and down, up and down like that.<br /> <font color="DarkRed">But for fire, or for water, or for Mother Earth there is no alternative, no more alternative. If I just touch the Mother Earth and I say, 'Suck in their problems, please!', She sucks them. If I tell the fire, 'Now, come along, you have been ignited.' I don't even tell! I don't even tell, they immediately suck in. Their Kuṇḍalinī rises you can say. You put a fire in front of My Photograph, it's vibrated. You put a light, it's vibrated. It has no alternatives! It doesn't think, it has no alternatives, is just enlightened, it has its own quality of enlightenment in the purest sense.<br /> Because thinking makes it impure. Your enlighten-ment becomes impure by your thinking, by giving explanation, by giving all these nonsensical mh-mh-mh alternatives.</font><br /> <font color="DarkRed">So one should know: for Divine there is no alternative. In Sanskrit the word is paryāy: there is no paryāy for Divine, Divine Instrument. There's nothing like that.</font><br /> Supposing, you don't want to accept it, you'll have problems. And then you'll say: that, 'Mother, how did we have problems?'<br /> As you saw in Delhi [end of January, beginning of February]: I told these people, many a times, that, "Please do not have any program for eight days, and let all these people stay with s-some friends."<br /> They wouldn't listen to Me. They arranged their program in that flat business. And they were thinking they will have a big uh pandal in which they'll give you ... give them the food to eat and all that.<br /> But you know what happened? It rained, and rained, and rained. Now rain knew what I wanted!<br /> [As laughter starts:] And -- because it had to rain for the rabi core ... uh crop! You see, you can, I ca[n], you see, you have to look after the whole universe!<br /> And that's why I said that, "For these eight days don't allow them to stay in this because it will be difficult for them to move out, better keep them with some other people so they can carry them along and do that."<br /> But they did not listen.<br /> Ultimately, it turned out to be a fiasco: they had to arrange for the stay of all other people into some houses.<br /> So this is this situation there.<br /> Now, they might say that, 'Mother, You better stop the rain.' I will not. Because it isn't, they must know that the question of rabi crop is also equally important for Me, and they have to have their share. After all, they are human beings and they are to be helped!<br /> But why didn't you listen to Me?<br /> And then he came to Me and he said that, "Mother, will You please stop the rain tomorrow?" I said, "All right. Tomorrow I will."<br /> He went back and he told the other gentleman, he said: that, "Let's put up the śhāmiyānā, let's put up the pandal, and the uh-uh-uh ... let the ... uh, let us cook there." He said, "But no, it will rain." He said, "No! It will not because I have take ... told God Himself." Uh she [he] said, "Where did you meet God?" He said, "I did meet Her. And now is done."<br /> The next [day] it was, he got up at five o'clock, the other fellow, to see the thing. And he saw the whole sky so clear, he said, "Look at that! You have told God, and God has listened to you." [Laughs.]<br /> So, this is it.<br /> Then when you are that much one with God, I mean, if you tell anything it will work out, anything. Anything you ask for it will work out.<br /> But we are not! We are all the ... always finding alternatives, you see. And these alternatives is the game the, all these people have played with you, all the gi... time giving you alternatives.<br /> You see, see now, in the market if you go, just now I asked him about how, "What car you have here? So he told Me, "There are so many combinations, this, that, if with cylinder this, that, so you go mad. You say, 'All right, bābā, give me something, whatever it is.' "<br /> And then, you see, they ... this is all playing with your brains, all the time giving you alternatives: 'Whether you want this or that.'<br /> And you feel that you are really a great personality that you can decide about: 'I'll have this color and that thing!'

But some of those who have come to Sahaja Yoga have also gone away, saying that there must be some other methods and powers that should work it out. This is just escapist reaction. Supposing you are diving a well and you find water in one place, what is the use of digging in other places? Whatever you have found, it is the water, so why not make the well there? But this is how many people are escaping reality. One should face it and get it. There is no other way human transformation can take place, as has been said in so many ancient books. Still, if people want to escape it, then you cannot help it. You cannot force them.

It is such a great pity, I must say, that this kind of convincing and cajoling of the complicated Western brain takes such an unnecessary long time. It is quite ironic that those leaders and teachers who are fake, who are modern anti-Gods, who are against the Divine, who are for the destruction of human beings, actually become very successful and achieve a worldwide following in such a short time. It is also true, however, because of the activity of the Paramachaitanya and law of polarity, that false teachers are being revealed for what they are and all the false ideas perpetrated by them are being exposed and destroyed very quickly. They appear and establish themselves easily, but in this age of Kṛita Yuga, it is only for a short time. The trouble is that after the exposure of one guru people are so weak that some immediately start looking around for another one. When they settle down with one, they usually end up lost as moneyless recluses. This guru shopping is now a common and fashionable lifestyle in the West of the seekers. It is the same with other kinds of ideology. Communism has failed in Russia, and fundamentalism and racialism have filled the vacuum and begun to prosper in the so-called democracies.<br /> ......<br /> Now they are mugging and even killing people who are only slightly more affluent than themselves. So, as these developed societies become richer and richer, by another action of the Law of Polarity, they also create increasing numbers of thieves and more and more sophisticated Mafias, who make money by kidnapping rich people who have made money and spread corruption and misery wherever they spring up.
