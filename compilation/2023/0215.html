That way the Pūjā is done by heart. That time waves after waves of joy start flowing because when Ātmā Tattwa is the focal point there can not be any thoughts. The way people fill wine in a glass, same is with you performing Pūjā, your śhraddhā is the wine and the glass is nothing but the recitation of mantras and sādhana. While drinking this wine you are completely engrossed, with no thoughts, and you swim in this joy. How to express that joy in thoughts [words]? The wine which is inside the stomach, who is going to pour it back into a glass? And that too in an inferior glass made of thoughts. Joy after drinking this wine is eternal. It is your wealth. Many Pūjās like this have happened in front of Me and every time a big wave comes and takes you to a new shore. Those experiences from different shores become your own. They give grandness to your personality and open new doors of joy.<br /> It is best to do a Pūjā in the heart. If you can look at the Photo and then bring it into your heart, or after a Pūjā if you can bring that scene into your heart, then the joy of that moment can become permanent and will last for a long time. Read this letter to all Sahaja Yogis and send them copies of this letter."<br /> <br /> <b>Version 2:</b><br /> "You should say the Mantras in Pūjā but with great faith (śhraddhā). <font color="DarkRed">There is no alternative to śhraddhā.</font> You should perform the Pūjā when śhraddhā grows deep, so that heart itself gets all Pūjā performed. At that time waves of bliss start flowing because it is the Spirit that is saying, how can any thought come at that time? People pour their wine in the glass. Your Pūjā is like that. In that, wine is your faith and the glass is the recitation of Mantras and the worshiping. When you are drinking that wine forgetting everything, how can a thought come! Then only bathing in the Ocean of Bliss! How can that joy be expressed in thoughts? Who will pour that wine, back in the glass, which is to be drunk and that too in the inferior glass of thoughts? However, the joy that you get after drinking the wine is eternal and ever-present. It becomes your asset. Many such Pūjās have been performed in My presence. Every time a big wave comes and take you to a new land. Experiences of many such lands become your own. They give vastness to personality and open new gates of joy.<br /> Best is worshiping in the heart. If, the Photo by looking at it, can be placed in heart or, after the Pūjā, its view goes to heart, then the joy which you get only at that time, can become everlasting and ever-present.
