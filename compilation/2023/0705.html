You know these five elements, all of this creation was made with them. So, these five elements had to be awakened with Yagñyas from the Vedas, and prayers and praises were recited. The five elements were awakened with Yagñyas. It was necessary to awaken these five elements, the fire, the water. It was only after they were awakened that human beings could have put them to use. Agriculture started after that as did the idea of science.<br /> If our Piṅgalā nāḍī hadn't been awakened we wouldn't have researched into science nor known how to use these five elements, how to make electricity and how to use fire. We wouldn't have known fire let alone how to make it!<br /> So that we become capable of making all this, that's why the right side had to be worshipped. That's why Yagñyas were performed. And because all these energies are formless, that's why the Formless was worshipped at that time.<br /> Once these were awakened, people wondered what to do next.<br /> Then meditation started and people came to the Central Path.<br /> Once they started progressing on the Suṣhumṇā, they could see where the Deities were seated and that the bodies of the chakras were made of these five elements. When they studied the elements, they realized that they were governed by Deities. After that, they got to know these Deities one after the other, through meditation.<br /> Then they claimed that they had Forms so the focus shifted from the Formless to Form. Those whose awareness evolved came to the Form.<br /> Then you know what happened to the ones who started believing in the Forms. `Worship this!', `Worship that!' Ritualism came into being. Blind faith and religious fanaticism came into being and things were in a miserable state.<br /> <font color="DarkRed">Then there was a great revolution, and not only that, Muhammad Sāheb took His birth. Christ came into this world. These people said that the Formless is to be worshipped and to do away with the Form.</font>"<br /> There was a lot of secrecy in this matter at that time.<br /> However, the Bible says that, `All that is made by the Earth and the Sky should not be replicated and worshipped.' If Christians could understand this and apply this understanding to the practice of idol worship.<br /> What has the Earth made? The Earth has made all the swayambhus.<br /> Now tell the Christians that the Earth has made the swayambhus Herself and if you make their replicas, they are not worthy of worship because they're imperfect.<br /> These things have a coefficient, too. Forms have a coefficient because of which there is a flow of the Chaitanya.<br /> It is impossible to replicate those forms in exactly the same way. Also, the one who makes them should be a realized Soul who should not put his creation up for sale. Keeping this in mind, mostly all the idols that we worship are of zero value."<br /> <font size="+0"><b>1979-0304 Public Program (Hindi), Day 2, Session 2 (evening), Town Hall, Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="DarkRed">""</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1979-0311 Public Program (English + Hindi), Day 2, Session 2 (evening), On Gāndhī and Collective Consciousness, Gāndhī Bhawan, Delhi University, North Campus, GC Narang Road, Timarpur, New Delhi, India</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="DarkRed">""</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b></b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="DarkRed">"Today our country needs a big spiritual revolution.}"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1986-1011 Public Program (Hindi) (8th Day of Navarātri), Sahajyog ke Anubhav (Experience of Sahaja Yoga), Ice Skating Ring, Kolkata, West Bengal, India (place and date not sure)}</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="DarkRed">""</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b></b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> "<font color="DarkRed">Modern democracies began to emerge in the eighteenth century, but at around the same time, with the advancement of science, the industrial revolution began to manifest itself.

It does not conform to the rules and regulations laid down for the human value system. Science is the knowledge of matter and matter has its own internal regulations. Unlike human beings, matter does not have free will with which to establish any ethical value system for itself.

Somehow people want to take up the challenge to become the evil force themselves. People have now to decide if they want to stop this democratic derailment by understanding what must be done.
