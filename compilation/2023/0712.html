That means you feel your Spirit yourself, and you feel very happy. Then you give Realization to others, you get Parānanda, joy of others. But when you get the enjoyment of well-being, in health and materially all right and everything all right, everything in saṃtoṣha, in complete satisfaction, then it's Brahmānanda. And like that you start feeling higher and higher joys within yourself. Because your nerves start opening to new dimensions.<br /> So you can say that at the Kṛiṣhṇa level, you get Kṛiṣhṇānanda, where you get the sweetness, the mādhurya. And when you see your generosity, then you get Śhivānanda. And when you are with children, you get Gaṇeśhānanda. And that can be described, all those can be described, but Nirānand cannot be described, because it's Mahāmāyā's Joy. All these joys put together is Nirānanda. So there is no place for ego and superego at all. The complete Sahasrāra is opened out, and nothing but the complete rapport is established with the Divine.<br /> And there is a pouring of light all the time in the head and the light going back, that you have seen in My Photograph. As if the Sahasrāra becomes like a sucking child from the Universal Mother, sucking the joy inside, and it is again reflecting back. It would be like the waves reach the shores and then they are again repleted, they go back and then they form a pattern.<br /> Now the joy out of that pattern, how can you describe? The only thing about Nirānanda is, that you have Mahāmāyā so close and so far away, that's the speciality.<br /> Completely thoughtless, silence there, complete silence, you don't think. It's just silence you cannot put into words any more, because the words break with the force of the Ānanda. They cannot hold it."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1985-0502 Talk to Sahaja Yogis, Nirānanda, Āśhram, Vienna, Austria</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> "But the first nihi means without, devoid, and nira means sheer. <font color="DarkRed">Like when you say Nirānanda, Nirātma: Sheer Ātmā, Sheer Joy. Kevalam, the only. There's nothing but Joy. But this one is used, nira or nihi, used in two forms as I told you: one for saying of ... without or devoid of, the another form is [for saying] the only, absolute, the absolute.<br /> So here the joy becomes Nirānanda: Absolute Joy, nothing but joy. It's complete freedom. So you have all kinds of joys, as I told you before: you have Swānanda, the joy of the Spirit, then you have got Brahmānand, the joy of well-being, you've got Līlānanda, Kṛiṣhṇānand, where you have the joy of the play. But when you reach the State of Sahasrāra it is Nirānand: means Sheer, Absolute Joy.<br /> Though the name Nirā is My name, it means Absolute. So, when you put such an adjective before anything else, it becomes absolute. Thus you become absolute. And when you are at that State of Absolute, then there is no place for anything else to be there but your Self.<br /> ......<br /> So this is what, at Sahasrāra you get Nirānanda.<br /> In different stages of Sahaja Yoga we had to start from Śharīrānanda, means the ā... ānand of the body, Mānasānanda, the joy of the mānasa, is the psyche. Then you can say Ahaṅkārānanda, where you have to have the satisfaction of the ego.
