They can also see good and bad souls as round bodies, their colors expressing their quality.</font> They do not see the body of the souls, but possessed people can see such bodies as they belong to the subconscious strata themselves.<br /> ......<br /> <font color="DarkRed">Spirits are of different colors, ranging from jet black to smokey black, or patchy golden if they are egoistical. By contrast, realized Souls appear like clear crystals, and sometimes shine like stars. Their face and body are of the same appearance as their body in life.</font><br /> ......<br /> In India they use also the dead spirits which are devoid of Kuṇḍalinī ... [<font color="orange">missing</font>] and Divine Spirit (<i>Ātmā</i>). They enter into the fetus about the same time. At their entry we can feel the pulse of the fetus.<br /> <font color="DarkRed">Realized Souls can see them in the atmosphere. Not in human form or colors but only as Kuṇḍalinī and Spirit engulfed by soul. Sometimes one sees bunches or sometimes loops of Kuṇḍalinī, and also in the forms of black or white dots. These souls carry the Spirit and the body of the Kuṇḍalinī as small coiled structures. These are the chakras, and to some are visible as different varieties of light.</font> The only one which is one with the Kuṇḍalinī is the Spirit (<i>Ātmā</i>) which is the light of the heart.<br /> It should be quite clear what one means by the word 'soul'. The soul, is the subtle body (<i>sūkṣhma śharīra</i>), the subtle form of the subject's body without the water element and the earth element. The soul consists of five sheaths. Two of these disintegrate on the physical plane at the time of death. They form the chromosomes. The rest of the bodies (<i>śharīra</i>) depart into the Collective Subconscious. <font color="DarkRed">This soul-body can vary in color from black, blackish violet, through green, light blue, and golden crystal to white.</font> These bodies dissipate in the atmosphere around an individual according to his unfulfilled desires. Those spirits which have spontaneously dropped all material desires rise effortlessly to great heights, beyond the atmospheric realm and human vision. They can sometimes descend to Earth, though, to appear as apparitions, or communicate certain revelations."<br /> <font size="+0"><b>The Book of Ādi Śhakti, Chapter 5: The Subconscious and the Collective Subconscious}\label{The Book of Ādi Śhakti, Chapter 5: The Subconscious and the Collective Subconscious</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> "<font color="DarkRed">In a Divine Incarnation this [Mūlādhāra] chakra has the color of clay, and it shines.</font><br /> ......<br /> <font color="DarkRed">In realized Souls the Mūlādhāra chakra shines like a neon misty or orange light. It appears as if the wicks of the Swastika are illumined with beautiful radiant lights. They look like four pinkish-orange colored tongues of flame which are silent yet living. The whole vision is of a four-petalled lotus with silent flames for petals. The lotus has a center which is deep blue or misty gray depending on Śhrī Gaṇeśha's mood. Realized Souls can peep into this ocean of deep color and visualize the melting of deep blue into light blue, and see sudden flashes appear like clouds and lightning. This vision spreads beautiful clouds of joy around the seeker.</font> The lightning is followed by the trunk of Śhrī Gaṇeśha, and after some time the elephant-headed Deity appears as a small child. At first He looks static to most realized Souls, but later on expresses a great deal of movement. Each movement creates a new wave of joy and tranquility. At a later stage, Śhrī Gaṇeśha becomes a living personality to such souls.<br /> ......<br /> <font color="DarkRed">In ordinary human beings (<i>Asahaja</i>) this chakra appears as coral color, and looks like four threads or wicks joined in the shape of a Swastika.</font><br /> ......<br /> <font color="DarkRed">In the case of misguided seekers (sādhakas) this subtle center appears red. In a clairvoyant, who is misguided because of misuse of his sympathetic nervous system, it appears deep red. Sometimes one sees only the wheel-like chakra rotating in a colored circular pattern of various shades of deep red and blue-black. This happens when Śhrī Gaṇeśha expresses His temper against the clairvoyant <i>sādhaka</i>.</font> Clairvoyance is only achieved with the help of 'dead spirits' by non-realized souls working through the sympathetic nervous system, and is an unauthorized disturbance to Him.<br /> ......<br /> Any effort at obstinate abstinence or overindulgence excites the sympathetic nervous system. With the pressure of overactivity, the subject's attention starts moving along the Iḍā or Piṅgalā nāḍī as the case may be. <font color="DarkRed">At first, a vision of the Mūlādhāra chakra as a deep red, multicolored kaleidoscopic wheel becomes visible to the individual. The deep red color is the result of Śhrī Gaṇeśha's anger due to unauthorized probing in His Realm. This unceremonious approach is insulting to Him and His Mother Kuṇḍalinī. Inside the very center of this wheel one can even see the angered and inflamed Śhrī Gaṇeśha if one attempts to force the probe further.</font> A misguided seeker may even get a shock, or feel terrible heat in his body and suffer inexplicable restlessness. Particularly horrible experiences of the past, known as 'flashbacks', may occur. Some people howl and jump around like wild animals; others who are impotent and exhibitionistic often end up taking off all their clothes.<br /> ......<br /> So the seeker who insults the Primordial Mother is greatly punished by Śhrī Gaṇeśha. No one can harm Him as He is inviolable under the Holy Aura of love of His Mother. His indestructibility is proved in the Resurrection of Christ. Seekers trying hard to reach Him can only work through the sympathetic nervous system, and their attention moves through the right or left channels as the central parasympathetic nervous system is beyond their reach. Eventually, by such stupid persistence, such misguided seekers are dangerously sidetracked and become clairvoyant. Their attention only goes onto the fringes of His chakra without any control and rotates on the outermost border. <font color="DarkRed">Sometimes such individuals describe their vision of this chakra. It seems like the wrath of Śhrī Gaṇeśha bubbles as a red and blue colored fire which rotates at the surface of the chakra.</font> It does not make any sense to these ignorant people. In reality, the chakra is like a bulbous bloom in the shape of a morning glory flower. <font color="DarkRed">If the misguided seeker persists in his obstinate pursuits, then Śhrī Gaṇeśha appears in red hot hues, and warns the seeker to stop the unauthorized probing.</font> At this stage, if the seeker does not give up he is punished by Śhrī Gaṇeśha's anger expressed as tremendous heat or a burning sensation. Sometimes blisters may appear in an elliptical line, starting from the navel and going around the neck. This can occur without any advance warning. The seeker may jump like a scalded cat, or experience agonizing burning sensations. All these symptoms are due to the insult the misguided seeker bestows on Śhrī Gaṇeśha and His Mother, and not to Kuṇḍalinī awakening, which many stupid people identify it with. This kind of physical resistance is apparent only in people who do not mentally accept the sin (<i>adharma</i>). But those who by their previous karmas or weaknesses accept sin, feel as if their responsibility is over. They feel relaxed and the entities working through them enjoy the pleasures, while they themselves feel pure. Actually, such a subject is dominated completely by these entities, and turns into a slave and an insensitive person."<br />" <font size="+0"><b>The Book of Ādi Śhakti, Chapter 12: Mūlādhāra Chakra</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="DarkRed">"The earth element created the Swādhiṣhṭhān chakra and gave it its yellow color. It thus appears as six yellow-colored threads in most people when it comes into vision in meditation. The color ranges between pale yellow to mustard from person to person, depending on their state of mind as far as their creativity is concerned. In a realized Soul the color is golden, and in an Incarnation it looks like a brilliant Sun. In its center there is a round deep hollow, bluish-yellow in color. In the wrong type of seeker (<i>Asahaja</i>) this appears as a deep blue-black coloration. For a Yogi, though, who is able to peep into this hollow, the form of Brahmadeva in pale yellow colors is clearly visible.</font><br /> ......<br /> <font color="DarkRed">Animals have no sense of beauty; only human beings can feel the esthetics of a composition of different colors, or the movement of lines and the melting of forms.</font> The feelings of joy acquired through this esthetic sense create a <i>Rasa</i> (a secretion of the essence or juice of a feeling). This Rasa gives one a stimulative feeling that sets in motion waves of esthetic joy within the Inner Self. These joys are of different frequencies and vibrations. One does not need to dissect them but as I look at the different petals of this chakra, I shall try to explain the kinds of joys present in the realm of creativity expressed through divine enlightenment.<br /> ......<br /> I know a gentleman from Africa who possessed a huge piece of jade. After getting his Self-realization he felt that the stone was emitting vibrations. <font color="DarkRed">He sensed that jade had three colors: green, pink and white in circular layers. He made a unique flowerpot out of that piece of jade which was white in color with a pattern of green leaves and pink flowers. Quite ordinary stones can be transformed through esthetic sensitivity into such priceless works of art through the Grace of the Power of Saraswatī.</font><br /> There are no temples to Brahmadeva because He is never there to attend any pūjā or worship. He is too busy looking after the creation which represents Him, and is His witnessing power in human evolution. <font color="DarkRed">But the main activity of this Deity is to create absolute beauty, beauty emitted through a variety of textures, colors, lines and forms in matter.</font> Variety is the essence of beauty, and the harmony of those varieties creates a bliss which is felt by an awakened mind. It is also felt, much more, as joy. The artist produces a work to express the joy he felt glimpsing the beauty of creation. Many artists who are great Souls and worshipers of Saraswatī have added to Brahmadeva's material creation, establishing a new community of subtler human beings called artists. <font color="DarkRed">The joy poured into nature by the Primordial Mother is enjoyed by artists, and is revealed in the universal language of colors, lines and forms they use to express it.</font> They fill human lives with exquisite creations of music, art, dance and other art forms. All this is the blessing of the Goddess Saraswatī who is in the image of Mahāsaraswatī, Deity of the Piṅgalā nāḍī. This channel is responsible for supplying Praṇava for the creation of all human endeavors.

It is as if Her assuring love asserts matter to hold all its aspects together through its sustenance, like a nugget of gold, which is yellow and shines and has a peculiar character all of its own. <font color="DarkRed">All that is yellow or shines is not necessarily gold, but real gold is gold because it is yellow in color, shines and does not tarnish.</font> Its quality of not tarnishing is gold's sustenance (<i>dharma</i>).<br /> ......<br /> When a seeker gets his Self-realization, Praṇava manifests the existence of the five elements. A Sahaja Yogi feels an energy like electricity oozing out of his extremities (<i>Chaitanya Laharī</i>). These are the Divine Vibrations of Praṇava but they also express the electrical part of his nature.

This sort of ignorance may appear very funny to us, but armed with this special kind of rationality, or rather with the rationalizations of imperialism and colonialism, they actually killed thousands and even millions of people, plundering their land and making slaves of the population. As a result, one cannot find a single Red Indian in North America living freely and naturally in the traditional way, because they are all locked up in reservations "generously" given to them by the invaders. One has to go to the museum to see their pictures painted with the head dressed as of Red Indians but, strangely, with the faces of Anglo-Saxons.</font><br /> Thank God some divine providence took Columbus to America and kept him there, instead of to India where he thought he was heading. <font color="DarkRed">Otherwise, the "colored" people of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Tibet, Nepal, Afghanistan and all other "stans" with their ancient and sophisticated cultures, would have also been completely devastated and destroyed by the superiority complex of the Conquistadors, those bull fighters of Spain, whose great contribution to civilization was creating the "peace" and the "calm" of the Catholic churchyard.</font> But to make up for Columbus' neglect, the great Anglo-Saxons came to India from England, did their best to neutralize the heritage and deep wisdom of India, and then gracefully left after 300 years of respectable hospitality from their unasked hosts. They left India peacefully, but with this great country disastrously divided into two different parts into which the seeds of violent destruction were already sown.<br /> ......<br /> <font color="DarkRed">When the Anglo-Saxons were busily plundering those "inferior" cultures of the "colored" races (especially in America), their ego developed to the extent that they were thoroughly blinded to reality and they began to think that their arrogance and their inhuman behavior was perfectly normal and quite all right. They found, according to all the rules and logic of rationality and to their great satisfaction, that they had nicely plundered the whole world, crushed all the "inferior" races into submission and had now settled down comfortably to enjoy the fruits of their arrogance.</font> Of course, polarity started manifesting itself. America, particularly, began to prosper and, despite the great idealism of the American Revolution against colonialism, the people gradually became slaves to luxury, and the victims of their own egoism.
