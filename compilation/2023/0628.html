At first, only a few flowers come up, but at the time of the blossoming the phenomenon of en masse Self-realization is manifested. <font color="red">This Divine Love that I pour is your own right for this is the culminating point of the human evolution which has been promised by the Scriptures.</font> ...... <font color="red">Can you conceive of an energy which thinks, organizes, feels and love?</font><br /> ......<br /> <font color="red">If love cannot blossom in the optimum conditions of marriage how can it blossom out of it?

If one wheel is bigger than the other, the chariot cannot move properly. Both must be respected. The husband-wife relationship has to be absolutely informal; all artificiality must be dropped. <font color="red">They must love and also sometimes quarrel to show their concern. This is the sign of a healthy relationship. But a woman has to behave like a woman and man has to be like a man. Spontaneous fidelity, love and mutual sharing are the only way one can give and receive the joy of married life.</font> The slightest deviation from conjugal fidelity must be absolutely avoided, and if committed, openly confessed. A person who does not believe in a one-woman one-man relationship should not marry at all; why make another person unhappy? The effects of secret infidelity are of the worst kind and can ruin the whole society?<br /> ......<br /> What sin can you commit that I cannot devour? <font color="red">You know, the Devī's Love is like the bottom of the ocean; no matter how big the ocean is, its bottom is always bigger.</font><br /> ......<br /> [Related to the seekers that come to public programs and then they fizzle out due to the escapism that Śhrī Mātājī is too pure and too great:] <font color="red">The ocean of sin cannot be greater than the heart of your Lord who loves you.</font> He can drink all the poison.

This magnanimity lies within human being and is awakened by Kuṇḍalinī. But how can those people have this joy of spontaneity who are living in artificial atmosphere? Although Kuṇḍalinī has been awakened and She has pierced Brahmarandhra yet heart must be pierced. <font color="red">But some Sahaja Yogis have hearts like stones, absolutely devoid of love; they use sarcastic words while talking to others and want to show that they are great. On many occasions I have seen, people push others or shout at others even in My presence. Particularly, when you shout at the children, I feel pain in My heart. At least Sahaja Yogis should have deep love for each other. When you know that you are the children of the same Mother, why do you look down upon some people? Are you perfect? Are there no faults in you? We only talk of Universal Love. If you have no love for each other amongst you, then in which mankind will it be seen? All I want to tell you is to clean your minds of venomous thoughts that you have for other Sahaja Yogis.</font><br /> If a Sahaja Yogi visits your town, invite him, look after him, as if he is your brother. His happiness will purify your homes. I cannot understand how there can be groups among the Sahaja Yogis, because every moment your condition is improving or going down.<br /> Know that making such groups is disastrous. <font color="red">Look at the good qualities of others and enjoy their love.</font> Don't worry about their bad qualities. Leave them for Me.

It is something that's just flowing. Not rationality, nothing. It is to feel, feeling for the pain of others. Feeling for their longing and feeling for their aspirations. Just feel within.</font><br /> With Yoga [Self-realization] we become collectively conscious. We can feel our centers and that of others on the fingertips. As Muhammad Sāhib had said, ``At the Time of Resurrection, your fingers will speak."<br /> The Namāz has the real ritual to know the Spirit.<br /> The Pūjās and worship all pour joy on our central nervous system. We feel the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost, the Chaitanya Laharī in living experience. We become one with the Divine and the rapport is established. The Divine Vibrations indicate and the coding if we know them, we know their meanings. <font color="red">Love has its own bondage -- very sweet and beautiful. We have to know the waves of the Divine Ocean of Grace and enjoy them.</font><br /> If a child comes and spoils our house then we should enjoy the fun of spoiling. If our freedom is challenged by a little child's crying, we are not a wise person. It's abandonment, it's loneliness, it's cutting off from the Primordial One that we are not being able to tolerate other people's freedom. We have to be truly free. When a little child cannot cry in its own home, what kind of freedom is that? If a child cannot eat what he wants in his own home what kind of freedom is that? <font color="red">Of course, this freedom is to be pruned, nourished and developed in the Correct Way of Love.</font>"<br /> <font size="+0"><b>1900-0000 Quote from the book Gita Enlightened (2014) by Yogi Mahajan, Pages 56 and 57</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">"It [Kuṇḍalinī] organizes and plans everything, and above all loves you."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1900-0000 Quote from the book Gita Enlightened (2014) by Yogi Mahajan, Page 322</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> "Kuṇḍalinī gives Self-knowledge, that is She points out problems on chakras.

Many chakras that were dormant until now became active. I was witnessing a miracle of your love. Keep sending such pure love. I bless you that you all will achieve all the infinite that is beyond this mahāmāyā.<br /> This love is not the regular human love and is like Ambrosia. It is like a drizzle but there are waves of the ocean behind it. That ocean has decided to drench you. You should remember that the actions of Me going away from you or Me running towards you, are the two ropes used for churning. I enjoy this as a witness. My chakras are the churner that are churning you and the butter of love comes up. I am standing just like a pole -- immovable and inevitable.<br /> You are worthy of this love. You should stay immersed in that love and share it with others.</font> And distributing this Nectar is the only condition. That Kṛiṣhṇa who stole the butter to share with others should be awakened in you. Somehow you must acquire that butter.
