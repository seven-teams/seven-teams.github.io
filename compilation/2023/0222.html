Yes, He created this world because He wanted to reflect Himself, His Truths, His Beauty, His Grace, His Compassion, His Sweetness, His Righteousness, all that can be termed as culture." ......<br /> Artists have to raise the taste of public eye to their standards of taste and not to stoop down to the cheap demands of the public and thus surrendering their freedom. This can be done by contacting educational and social institutions by the enlightened artists. Through articles in magazines and newspapers, the idea[s] of such artists can be propagated. Through dramas, films and radio talks, people can be educated for the understanding of real art. Thus the dignity of art can be maintained.<br /> By coming in contact with the public at large through these societies, the social self of an artist will develop into a keener and a [more] sensitive being. It will react to the slightest unrest in the nation, to the slightest imbalance in the society. If he sees a leper on the street, his heart will pour out with such sympathy through his art that he can create an atmosphere by which social workers, doctors, scientists and the people in charge of the state will be forced to think of some solution to the problems of leprosy. If an artist finds his countrymen being unpatriotic or cowardly, he can through his art inspire them and can serve the role of a brave soldier. Thus he can serve the society through other by creating a deep impact on their minds. Such is the motivating power of an artist. They are the loveliest flowers of the creation, the sweetest dreams of the Creator and the dearest parts of the human society. Perhaps, they do not know how they are loved, worshiped and followed by their spectators. This is my humble concept of art, culture and artist. In my honest efforts, I have tried to suggest certain ways and means by which artists can get united and give a lead to further the cause of art.</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1961-1000 Article 'Art Culture and Artist' published in the souvenir 'Dignity of Art' brought out to commemorate the Inauguration of the 'Youth Society For Films' by the Union Home Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri on 1961-1008, the function presided over by the Chief Minister of Maharashtra Y.
