It is through this channel that we become collectively conscious and all the disparate factors of our being are integrated in one whole. It makes the connection between our conscious mind and the 'auto' of the autonomic nervous system, the Spirit, which is the reflection of God. <font color="DarkRed">Suṣhumṇā is the Way of Dharma, the straight and narrow path by which we pass through the gate of the Āgñyā chakra to enter into the Kingdom of God in the Sahasrāra.</font><br /> So with the Sahasrāra open and the connection with Suṣhumṇā established, we are open to the source of all awareness where all knowledge dwells, and is sustained by the Primordial Source of All Power (Ādi Śhakti). Meditation in thoughtless awareness is the key to the development of a strong Suṣhumṇā. <font color="DarkRed">Another basic requirement is to enjoy a virtuous and dhārmik life. After Realization, try to keep in thoughtless awareness as much as possible, with attention centered in Suṣhumṇā nāḍī, the channel of the eternal present, where the only time is 'now'.

Understand that it is final and ultimate goal of our evolution. When Kuṇḍalinī is awakened, It pierces the Brahmarandhra but post this connection, the Yoga has to be established. Not for too long but meditation for a short while has to be practiced every day.<br /> ......<br /> <font color="DarkRed">Another big change that happens is sense of righteousness (dharma) is awakened within us, it's within and not without.</font><br /> For example, any Hindi, Muslim or Christian can commit any sin or do wrong deeds, his religion has no binding upon him. <font color="DarkRed">But it's such a thing that once dharma is awakened within, you cannot commit anything illicit.</font><br /> Compassion, mercy, etc. are awakened within you and despite this you become extremely energetic and dynamic. Whatever you keep doing, you won't feel tired. You do your work in very loving and peaceful way.<br /> With this, you attain peace with you, become absolutely peaceful. A person who has very angry temperament becomes absolutely calm. Because whatever angularities you have within, become all right. All deformities within us are due to problems in plexuses [chakras] and once these chakras become all right, they get all right.<br /> ......<br /> This work is going on in seven[ty] countries. Thousands of people get together, but never ever there is any tussle. All live-in harmony together. Yes, sometimes they do tease each other but jokingly, in a friendly manner. You would not have seen such friendships otherwise. Whether this person is from Russia, England, Japan or anywhere they build a collective love amongst themselves.<br /> <font color="DarkRed">Because of this, when true religion (dharma) is awakened within, they understand that all religions are one, understand totality of all religions. You don't criticize any religion and worship all Dharma Pravartaka [Founder(s) of Religion].</font>"<br /> <font size="+0"><b>1907-0000 Interview (Hindi) with a Lady for a TV Program Directed by Ashok Agarwal, Ardhamātrā Volume 2, New Delhi, India</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="DarkRed">""</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1972-0409 Public Program (Marathi), Dhule, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="DarkRed">""</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b></b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p style="color:red;">Jay Śhrī Mātājī!<br /></p></font></p></section><footer class="page__meta"></footer><nav class="pagination"> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/compilation/2023/0712" class="pagination--pager" title="Post 43: Joys or Types of Joy ">Previous</a> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/compilation/2023/0729" class="pagination--pager" title="Miscellaneous Post 3: Step 5 (Drawings, English Letters, Handwritings, Hindi Letters, Marathi Letters) ">Next</a></nav></div></article></div><div class="page__footer"><footer><div class="page__footer-follow" style="width: max-content"><ul><li><strong>Follow:</strong></li><li><a href="/feed/festivity.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Festivity RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/compilation.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Compilations RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/quotes.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Quotes RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/scriptures.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Scriptures RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/yearly.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Yearly RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/divine.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Divine Message RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/chronology.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Photos RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/archives.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Archives RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/events.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Divine Events RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/news.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>News RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/chronology.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Chronology RSS Feed</a></li></ul></div><div class="page__footer-copyright"> Site content created by the Seven Teams. <br> Website powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" rel="nofollow">Jekyll</a> with <a href="https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io">AcademicPages</a> as a theme, modified by Sean Xiao, and a fork of <a href="https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/" rel="nofollow">Minimal Mistakes</a>.</div></footer></div><script src="https://seven-teams.github.io/assets/js/main.min.js"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', '', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script src="https://unpkg.com/vanilla-back-to-top@7.2.1/dist/vanilla-back-to-top.min.js"></script> <script>addBackToTop()</script></body></html>
