Is it Logos or something? What is that? What is it comprising of, what does that mean, how it starts, from where it has come? It is Auṃ. Auṃ comes from three words uh, ooh, muh. Uh, ooh, muh.<br /> Uh stands for the first creation of the left-hand side, what we call the Mahākālī Power. First only in the world manifestation of the superego took place, so we can say that uh stand for the beginning when only up to the stage when life was not created.<br /> Ooh stands for the other stage, where, now sound is the same. Sound is the same, manifestation is different. The voice is the same, My sound is the same, for example whatever is My sound, you can make it out wherever I speak, this is Mātājī speaking.<br /> Maybe the manifestation is different in uh, ooh, muh, so first uh starts, then comes to ooh, which is Mahāsaraswatī Power. We can say the three notes which we have as, I don't know in English what you say to the notes but we say sah, uh sah [<font color="orange">unclear</font>], the basic three notes, so the second note is that of Mahāsaraswatī by which the life -- sun life -- started working.<br /> And the third one is the muh through which evolution started taking its place. So that is the Mahālakṣhmī stage.<br /> So you have got these Three Powers working together, and that is, in a very short form, we say it is Auṃ.<br /> But it is not only that human beings have said it. When you meditate you have seen that Auṃ. I'm saying that these Three Powers have a third, these three sounds, and that's how this word is created, of Auṃ.<br /> For a realized Soul, Auṃ is a most powerful thing. For example, if you want to protect yourself, the word Auṃ itself can protect, and when these Three Powers combine as Auṃ we say that this only the Child or the Son God represents in its purest form Auṃ. That's why in the life of Christ, or we can say in the life of a personality that represented the Son of God, Auṃ is very important because He embodies that Auṃ within Himself. All these Three Powers are in Him, and in the most innocent form.<br /> ......<br /> In this sound of Oṃkāra, the complete sounds of the worlds are there. All the permutations and combinations, the complete melody of this universities within these three sounds uh, ooh, muh. It is based on Auṃ.<br /> When the Kuṇḍalinī moves also, it moves in three ways uh, ooh, muh, because in the lower portion it is the uh. In the center portion it is the ooh, and here it is the muh. Meaning that at the lower portion of the human being we are what was created as dead matter. In the center we are what is creation, means creativity, and in the third is the evolutionary, so even we are divided in three ways -- is, we are, our upper part is muh, central part is ooh and the lower part is uh. That is how we are, and when you say Auṃ in a proper way, you find the Kuṇḍalinī rises.<br /> ......<br /> Auṃ works like anything. Now you may say that where is the word Auṃ in the Christian religion? It is in Amen. Amen is nothing but Auṃ, because muh means a nasal sound, and end of a nasal sound, and nuh also means nasal sound, because in the Arabic language it's written like a nee, you see, and nee with My name, you say, nuh, with My name starts nuh, also written with a dot, all of them have got a dot. It's a dot which shows that it's a nuh. And in the Sanskrit language, dot means nuh. And that is why it is muh and nuh. Amen is the same as Auṃ.<br /> Now the problem is everything, as evolution goes up, changes and that's why Auṃ was brought to the level of Amen. Uh became Ah and Ooh became Muh, and Muh became Nuh. As I told you that Christ came as a human being, but He was Gaṇeśha. And the Swastika became the cross. The same way, Auṃ is Amen.<br /> So after every prayer, you are supposed to say Amen. Why not Amen? What does that mean? From there the word Auṃ ends in English language.<br /> ......<br /> Now the same word Auṃ is used by negative forces also. How do they use it? They will give this name to some devil, normally they do not, because this is one of the purest words which cannot be Contaminated. Normally they will not, normally they will not. I have not met anyone so far who has got a devil on him with the name Auṃ, and nobody so far has given this name to anyone, but I have seen.<br /> ......<br /> He [person giving names] can use, but he cannot use the name of Auṃ, and he cannot use the name of Jesus. He cannot give the name of Śhrī Gaṇeśh. These names are beyond their [<font color="orange">unclear</font>]. You see because they are terrible. ...... They might say all kinds of Auṃs and everything. But with all of these they can attack someone, like this, they say Auṃ namo Śhivaya, it's all right. Auṃ namo Śhiva, now, Auṃ you have put it, in that it neutralizes, they perhaps do not know it neutralizes a little bit. Auṃ namo Śhivaya.<br /> And it means so great, means you bow to Śhiva. That aspect of God which is eternal. But they will say that you take the name Auṃ namo Śhivaya because with that the thing you see, it's overpowered by Śhiva, and that's how they will put Auṃ with that, but they'll never give a single word as Auṃ at [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] point, because no devil will own that name, it's too great. And these are the tricks these people play with the word Auṃ, and you should play with the same. Whenever you feel like that, you just say Auṃ. Don't say anything else, say Auṃ. For you, every sentence has an end. Even if you say Auṃ namo Śhivaya [<font color="orange">unclear</font>]. But even if you say Auṃ Jesus, it's enough. Now in a circle, if you say the complete universe into a circle, then you make three portions of that, you get three arches. Say one is uh, another ooh, another muh. When you try to reconstruct them, then you get uh ooh and muh, there are three arches, you reconstruct them. First arch is bent like this ... uh, ooh, second one like that, and the third one is muh. And the dot on that is the center point Is the center point of the circle, dot on that. Now you have seen how Auṃ is written down, and that is how it is, the three arches are described like that, so the whole creation and the center dot, which is the God Himself, all put together makes the Auṃ, and that is how it is being named. I think I have told you now first of all when the creation too, place, how first the Auṃ was formed. Did I tell you with the parabola, with the drawing, so the first sound, the first sound that started because of the separation, the first separation when it too, place between the two identities, God and His Power, that was the time the sound started, and that sound is nothing else but Auṃ. That sound will be there and will work out till these two identities become one, then there is no relativity left and so there is nothing, so people think the world has come out of nothing, because there is no relativity, when they become two then there is something, otherwise they are one and absolute, and so there is nothing, when the sound merges or finishes or, as we say, disappears [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] That is the time when the whole creation merges into one action. So that is the point where one has to go.<br /> Now, in your own being it happens. First you feel the Auṃ, you feel it sometimes the sound coming, sometimes you feel some sort of tingling going on, because there are seven sounds, which are easily discernible out of this Auṃ. Easily. But there are many, but I am saying at least seven you can easily find out. If you sit down sometimes you might hear some sort of a bell ringing, sometimes you'll hear as if there is a waterfall, and sometimes you'll hear as if in the night, the small crickets are singing. You see all kinds of sounds are coming, you see you feel that they are there, something is happening, in the night, you see, that sort of a feeling you'll get, all different types of sounds there are, but seven sounds you can easily find out, and all of them put together make the Auṃ. So, if you play all of them in a proper manner, in a melodious manner, well we can say in a harmonious manner, then you'll hear the sound Auṃ.<br /> ......<br /> So this Auṃ is, is a sound that understands, that talks, hat organizes, that informs, and that is the sound of the Divine Love. This is the electrical feeling that you get on your hand. But this is the sound.<br /> ......<br /> So we have got also five very subtle type of expression of five elements, and those are this fine sound of Auṃ, the vibrations are the electrical, there is a magnet in that sound, or in that powered, for a person who is, who is realized. The person who is blessed by God has a magnetic power. That person attracts. That person might not even speak about, but people know about these things. They know that he's a man who's realized, there's something special about him. Immediately you can find it out, what he is. It is because of this sound and the magnet. You must have heard that sound when we converted into matter. In the same way, all these things are converted, the sound becomes a magnet, the magnet becomes the vibrations, the vibrations can become the Spirit. So these are all convertible, and part and parcel of the same thing, the same energy which is the Divine Love, which is Love. Love has a sound, and love has electricity, it has got magnetism. And it has got the power. When all these subtle powers are poured on to any human being, it acts, it acts, and people start improving in their health. You must have heard of experiments where people have tried music on some people who are hot well, and they have been cured. And what happens is that they, the subtler, subtler powers of the sound that we are manifesting, that behind it, the power that is manifesting it, comes into play. Which is a very small thing there, but with you people, when you put you hand this is the sound of Auṃ which is vibrating, it is so micro, microwaved, vibrations, that you cannot see with a magnifying glass, you will not see My finger shaking at all, you'll say they are very steady, but they're very microwaves. And the microwaves, when they pass into the body of the human beings, or anything, there they awaken the microwaves that are sleeping in the body of the human beings, or whatever things you use, and they start generating the second, what you call, phase as the [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] of the outside [<font color="orange">unclear</font>].<br /> ......<br /> Now, when you people say Auṃ, realized people, when You say Auṃ, the sound waves of Auṃ, you just try on a person who is. Just now you are having some pain there. All right. Now, just now you put your hand there and say Auṃ. Try it."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1977-0400 Talk to Sahaja Yogis, Auṃ, (likely) Living Room, Gavin Brown's Geological Institute (Terrace House), 160 North Gower Street, 2nd Floor, Euston, London, UK (month and location not sure)</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="DarkRed">""</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b></b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">"Today as Yogi has asked Me to speak about Auṃ, I would like to tell you about the great word called Auṃ: what it is, what it represents, and how it came into being.<br /> ......<br /> Auṃ is a word people don't understand because it is at the very beginning of this creation that the energy of God, energy of His Love separated from His identity. He pushed Her, called it as Lāsya, He pushed Her to create, and He became the spectator and She had to create. At that time when She was pushed -- we don't have here something to show you how it worked -- but when He tried to push Her, Her movements went into a kind of a word which is [draws with the right index finger in the air]: written as like this three, A, U and M. So there are three words in it. At the time of that pushing, when the separation took place, there was a sound, this the first sound and that sound is called as Auṃ.<br /> So many people call it as Logos, but to understand it you have to go deeper into it to und[erstand] what it is was.<br /> So Her power got divided into three: A, U and M. And that's how She became Auṃ. So Auṃ is the sound which is emitted when She creates, which acts as the basis of the essence of Her Love.<br /> Then how She started creating is a very long story which I won't be able to tell you today, but this Auṃ is the one that She first used to create the innocence on this Earth. So this Auṃ was the innocence with which She filled the whole universe. So Auṃ is nothing but the innocence that you see in children, in so many people, in Saints and in most of the Incarnations, that they are empowered by Their innocence. And this innocence first filled the whole space. Even before creating the space the innocence was there. That was the first creation of element and that was the innocence. So Auṃ is innocence which does all the living work on this Earth.<br />"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1983-0929 Public Program, Day 2, Auṃ, Cultural Integration Fellowship, 260 Fulton Street, San Francisco, CA, U.S.A.</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="DarkRed">""</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b></b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">"<font size="+1">The Sound of Praṇava</font><br /> Praṇava's sound is known as <i>Anāhat</i>. It is generated when the Primordial Cell breaks like the hatching of an egg. It is audible with the departure of the nucleus from the ellipse.<br /> <br /> * The first linear movement of Ādi Śhakti makes the First Primordial Sound -- 'Ā'.<br /> * The push of Sadāśhiva causes the Second Primordial Sound -- 'Ū'.<br /> * The Third Sound -- 'MA' -- is caused by the pause stage, which follows the breathing in and breathing out of the Primordial Zygote.<br /> <br /> Praṇava is therefore the All-pervading Divine Power of Ādi Śhakti, and Anāhat is the sound created, without any percussion, by this Power. It can be understood better by describing Anāhat as the sound announcement of Praṇava.<br /> These three Primordial Syllables 'Ā', 'Ū' and 'MA', represent the Three Powers of the Primordial Mother:<br /> <br /> * 'Ā' represents the existence and Destructive Power of Mahākālī<br /> * 'Ū' represents the Creative Power of Mahāsaraswatī<br /> * 'MA' represents the Sustenance or Evolutionary Power of Mahālakṣhmī.<br /> <br /> These three Primordial Syllables, later on, form the Primordial Words (<i>Bīja Mantras</i>) 'Aim', 'Hrīm' and 'Klīm'. All together these comprise the phonetic words of the Devanāgarī script (Sanskrit), and will be examined in greater detail in the chapter on chakras.<br /> Much before the hatching of the Primordial Egg, the Primordial Zygote reaches the embryonic stage. It starts breathing and creates the Primordial Sound (<i>Anāhata</i>) that fills the entire embryo, which encircles the central point. The breathing of Ādi Śhakti is the Praṇava or Divine Power, while its sound is called Anāhata. This sound is without percussion and is heard on the heart as a pulsation. This sound is a mixture of seven component sounds (<i>Nādabrahman</i>), which when heard together creates the beautiful Word, 'Auṃ'. When it is broken into its component parts it sounds like 'Ā', 'Ū' and 'MA'.
