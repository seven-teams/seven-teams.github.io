Recently, saw William Blake's book called Milton. He was very philosophical and in His prediction He mentioned the place where Sahaja Yoga started (Surrey Hills) and the place where the foundation of the first center was established (Lambeth Vale), writing about both places is very surprising. It is also written that a common person will be becoming a Preṣhit (Prophet), who will be bestowed with special power. With this amazing power he will create many more Preṣhit [Prophets]. After reading this so deep and so correct information about Sahaja Yoga in His poem felt tremendous joy.

Things go beyond words and you cannot express yourself.&gt;br&gt; Many people do not understand Him because He wrote it, according to them, in abstract language, or in the language that He understood. But I am happy that Sahaja Yogis understand Him so well.<br /> And the prophesies that He made about England, people used to riducule [ridicule], ridicule it. Even today they can't believe that Jerusalem can be built in England. They cannot believe that people who have been all their lives, for ages together, thought of nothing but materialism, can take to spirituality to this extent that it becomes Jerusalem, and that the whole world comes to pay homage to this Holy Land: that this becomes the Holy Land. Is a fact! He dreamt, He wished it. Because He knew the value of this land.<br /> ......<br /> Since long, people knew about Kuṇḍalinī.<br /> Even if that is lost, for history, it remains it.<br /> And He knew about It, He spoke about It.<br /> In His lifetime, maybe, people never understood Him: He ... they must have thought that, `He's really a madman, or something, a fantasy, or some sort of a poet,' who doesn't understand.<br /> For what He wrote, every word of it, is the Truth.<br /> Such a great Soul should live, in Hampstead itself, is such a blessing. Great blessing.<br /> Such people, even if They write or not, They leave Their mark. Their ascent becomes the milestone for the people who live there: their aspirations become different, their priorities become different. The change is so subtle: is to be seen, is to be felt, to be understood.<br /> And very sensitive people only can be born in such places. Of course, there could be very bad people also who counteract. But the sensiti-vity of the atmosphere attracts such souls to that place who are sensitive.<br /> You can see from His poems that He was absolutely authoritative. He knew the authority, He had the authority. He talked like a man with complete authority. He had no doubt even. He has no doubts. He just said, ``This is going to happen!"<br /> And, like a great warrior, that He knew ... He knew that one has to fight the negativity, one has to fight all these dark problems.<br /> The Spirit has to fight all the time the matter.<br /> And that's how He talked, spoke, wrote, [as] a warrior would do, because He started the fight when He was born here, hundred years back."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1981-1128 Public Program, You Are the Spirit, Friends Meeting House, 120 Heath Street, Hampstead, London NW3 1DR, UK</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">""</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b></b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">""</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1981-1212 Conversation with Sahaja Yogis, House, 48 Brompton Square, Knightsbridge, London, UK (date not sure)</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">""</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b></b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">""</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1981-1231 Talk to Sahaja Yogis, New Year's Eve, Āśhram, 44 Chelsham Road, Clapham, London, UK}</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">""</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b></b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> "So, try to gather nourishment.

And suddenly I told the Sahaja Yogis, that I would like to go and see Tate Gallery for William Blake's paintings. They were surprised because I seldom go to any one of them, specially the libraries and the books.<br /> And when I went there, I saw this great poet, this great personality, pouring out His heart, with such concern, with such honesty, with such understanding and perception of the Divine, to the people of England, to understand the Great Powers of Divinity. But to My surprise, there were some sph-funny people: they had brought some magnifying glasses, and they were looking at the drawings, and were watching the private parts of people. I said, ``Look at these wretched, absolutely baser people, who cannot see the sublime, the highest, which He wanted to paint!" And they were taking photographs. I was surprised the way people reacted.<br /> And then I realized: `How tormented He must have been in His lifetime to live with such people, who have no sense of Divine! He must have cried in the wilderness, He must have wept.' He could not have been accepted! It's impossible! Such low-level minds cannot accept something that's sublime and great!<br /> And My heart bled with pain. `Oh God! Why did He take His birth in a place like this? To torment here's ... Himself, to torture Himself, saying something which cannot be accepted.'<br /> But's not so! I knew who He was, what He is doing, why He was here.<br /> We do not know about Him much, because from the books you can't understand who He could have been.<br /> He was an Incarnation, of Bhairavanāth. That's whom you call the Saint Michael, or Saint George, who is, as you know, the Saint ... Angel of England. That's why He had to incarnate! And for Him, this was His role, to talk about Divine in a[n] open, fearless manner.<br /> He had to use symbolic ... symbolic language. He had to use!<br /> Is not difficult to understand Him, at all. If you are a realized Soul, you'll read through it, sometimes laughing, sometimes weeping, enjoying the whole drama, what He has tried to express. <br /> When I read Him, I am amazed at His s-s-sense of humor: how He openly comes out with such remarks. I feel He is like Mārkaṇḍeya in India, or Kabīr Dās in India, who slashed the whole society with their sword all the time to see that they are brought to the proper shape, without fear. But so gentle. If you read the song of the '[Book of] Thel' [by Śhrī William Blake], is so gentle.<br /> And all of them, who were Him perhaps or are of the same style, [were] extremely open, straightforward, you can say even blatant and extremely gentle.br&gt; ......<br /> Traditionally we have known for thousands of years!<br /> I talk of Mārkaṇḍeya, who was there twelve thousand years back! Who incarnated here as William Blake. Twelve thousand years back He said the same thing which is said in England after twelve thousand years, because that time I don't know what was here! Maybe only jungles, I think.<br /> And that is also waste! Isn't it? Tell Me, isn't it?"<br /> ......<br /></font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1985-1128 Public Program (Śhrī William Blake's Birthday), Building the New Jerusalem, Hammersmith Town Hall, 1 Riverside Gardens, Hammersmith, London W6 9LE, UK</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">""</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b></b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">""</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b></b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">""</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>2001-0716 Public Program, Day 2, Hall, Holland Park School, Airlie Gardens, Campden Hill Rd, London W8 7AF, UK</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">"Also the leader can read books which are written by some enlightened people to show where they have gone wrong.

In this age of Kṛita Yuga, through the compassion of the Paramachaitanya (or Divine Love), the Kuṇḍalinī is being raised in countless human beings, so that it is actually happening: God's people have become Prophets and, what is more, they have powers to make others Prophets too.<br /> ......<br /> Most of the seekers that I met during that time told me that, although they knew they were looking for something, they were completely ignorant of what it was and had been mesmerized by these negative and false teachers. I have to say that it is truly lamentable the way earnest seekers have been exploited by these horrible so-called gurus from India. For seekers are a special category of people and, as such, they are very precious. William Blake describes them as "men of God". They are the ones who have been seeking in many lifetimes to find the Divine and have often become lost in the web of words of false ideas ("śhabda jālam" in Sanskrit, as described by Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya).<br /> ......<br /> On the firm foundation of Absolute Truth only, can one have complete confidence and an absolutely peaceful, nonviolent stand in the face of the relative world of uncertainty, contradiction and confusion. Such a person, like William Blake, for example, is truly what is meant by the word Saint &#8211; a person who states the truth simply as he sees it with his higher vision, and does not react vehemently or violently to contradiction and scorn, but pities his or her aggressors as blind and ignorant.<br /> ......<br /> Of course, modern art can also have a very evolved manifestation if it is emitted from the formless Spirit. It breaks the lines and forms of conventional art to create a formless substance which is full of light and transparent meaning. But to achieve this potential, one has to be a realized Soul, who can paint his formless joy in such a way as to represent and emit that abstract spontaneous enjoyment of the Spirit by the Spirit. Such art requires no commentary and no discussion. Only a poet can describe it. A poet like William Blake, who was a great evolved Soul and Seer, could also draw and paint the visions He describes in His poetry. The imagination of such poets touches all the beautiful heights that only an enlightened Soul can appreciate and enjoy. All those evolved souls, whether they are sitting in a simple village weaving a shawl for the Goddess, or singing the praise of the Eternal and Everlasting in divine poetry, or playing the divine music, are all the Creator's own Divine Ripples. They may sometimes not be understood, they may be criticized by ignorant, blind people, but they work and sing and play for themselves and for those who have Divine Knowledge and who can understand the world they portray."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1995-0929 Meta Modern Era, Chapter 1: Modernism and Rationality</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">"These are the seekers all over the world. What they are seeking is the peace of their own mind. It is a good news for such people that a unique discovery has been found out by which one can achieve the peace within. One has to go beyond the mind. This was very old knowledge in the East, especially in India, and there were Seers in the West who also knew about this knowledge by which one can achieve that state of Self-realization.
