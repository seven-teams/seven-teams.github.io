He wrote many texts: Saundaryalaharī, Upadeśhasāhasri, Vivekachūḍāmaṇi, Ātmabodh, etc. In most of these texts, there are various references to Kuṇḍalinī awakening, as some of the following stanzas [10 and 9 from Saundaryalaharī] will illustrate."</font><br /> [Having in-filled in the pathway of the nāḍīs with the streaming shower of Nectar flowing from Thy pair of Feet (Lotus Feet), having resumed Thine own position from out of resplendent lunar regions, and Thyself assuming the form of a serpent of three and a half coils, sleepest Thou in the hollow of the Kulakuṇḍa.] [Kulakuṇḍa=the hollow of the Mūlādhāra -- sacrum bone.]<br /> [Thou art diverting (residing) in secrecy with Thy Lord (the Spirit) in the thousand-petalled Lotus, having pierced through the Earth situated in Mūlādhāra, the Water in the Maṇipūra, the Fire abiding in the Swādhiṣhṭhāna, the Air in the Heart (Anāhata), the Ether above (the Viśhuddhi) and Manas between the eyebrows (Āgñyā) and thus broken the entire Kula path.]<br /> <font color="red">"Śhrī Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya propounded that it is the Kuṇḍalinī who has to be awakened and unless and until you get your Realization you are nowhere near religion. Śhrī Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya also had given a very befitting answer to the so-called proponents of Haṭha Yoga, Gyān Yoga, Karma Yoga or Rāj Yoga. "Neither by Yoga, nor philosophy, nor by work, nor by learning but by the Realization of one's identity with the Brahman is liberation possible and by no other means."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1900-0000 Two Quotes from the book Divine Knowledge through Vibrations (1992) by P.T.

By doing all this you cannot get God. You must understand by doing all this you will not get God.<br /> What I am saying? Read Vasiṣhṭha, or Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, because it is a historical thing. They have said the same thing that you get to God you cannot do anything. But there is a slight difference between them and Me that they had said that are very few who have the authority to get to God. Some should remain in bhakti and others should do some yogas so that they can keep their discipline. But they also said that a disciplined mind or a mind that is running after indulgences, both minds are useless for ascent. One has to have a mind like a small child which is without sin, and is innocent. Such a one has the right to attain God. This is what they have clearly said. But who reads them?<br /> The question is that we read a lot and we read about those who know nothing about dharma. And even if they know it is just a little bit.<br /> The ones who think they are very great Hindus they must first read Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya. Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya had established the Hindu Dharma. Then why not read Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya?<br /> You read all the books of the world, but why don't you read Him and know Him?<br /> The difference between what He said and I say is that He said that in crores there are just one or two and I say in crores, there are lākhs.<br /> ......<br /> There is no need to fight with people who talk useless things. Those who want to come should come and those who don't want to come should not come. There is no time left to argue and have discussions with them, because such people will go on discussing and arguing.<br /> As Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya has said that low-level people should keep their minds disciplined and somehow live properly and protect themselves from becoming thieves, etc. They should live like good citizens."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1973-0715 Guru Pūjā (Hindi) (Guru Pūrṇimā), Sahaja Yoga is a New Discovery, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">"Who is sitting on Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya's seat now, someone who is non-realized, so nothing doing.<br /> Nobody is going to sit on any seat.

Those who have not yet developed fully as a human being.'<br /> ......<br /> Now the only difference between him [Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya] and Me is that He used to say there that there is one in millions and I say that there are thousands in millions.

I bow to Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, who is the eldest Son of our country: He is very big man of our country. Although, Hindu religion is very much degraded and we just could not understood what Hindu religion is all about. Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya has clearly said, "Na Sāṅkhyen na Yogen" [an inversion of the first part of line 1 of Vivekachūḍāmaṇi 56], "God can't be achieved by anything." And He also has said that there are three types of people.<br /> First types of persons are those who seek God in devotion, they do not have intelligence. They do not understand they have not yet established a connection, then how they can talk to God? They cram like mad, shouts like mad and die after getting mad. But I would have no objection if it would have stopped just here, sometimes in this madness a man gets connected to Paralok [Collective Subconscious] and bhūt vidyā, etc. enters in him. It may happen.<br /> Second type of person is a person with very sharp intelligence, very intelligent, but he has very unstable mind. He runs here and there, run this way and that way. So such a person thinks of yoga practice, so that one can control mind. This is also very wrong attitude. You cannot reach there by controlling mind. So that person controls the mind, thinks that by controlling he will reach [there]. Such disciplined mind, such mind cannot take you to God, the car in which brakes are applied cannot take you there.<br /> But from this it should not be understood that the one who is indulgent or is very voluptuous, he can reach God. He can never reach to God. But the person who leaves all these things to think that, 'I have to seek that,' and he disciplines himself too much in the name of religion, he also does not reach.<br /> Actually, we have to become, we have to just become."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1973-1219 Public Program (Hindi), Nagpur, Maharashtra, India (other date 1222)</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">""</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1974-0327 Public Program (Hindi), Day 3, Chaitanya Laharī kyā Hai (What Are Waves of Vibrations), Biralā Krīṛā Keṃdra, Chowpatty, Girgaum Chowpatty, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India}</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">""</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b></b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">""</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b></b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">""</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b></b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">""</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b></b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">""</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b></b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">""</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b></b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">""</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b></b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">""</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b></b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">""</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b></b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">""</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>2001-0716 Public Program, Day 2, Hall, Holland Park School, Airlie Gardens, Campden Hill Rd, London W8 7AF, UK</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">"The roots of Tantrism are as ancient as the awareness of religion, but it came into full force during the years 900 -- 1400 A.D. Following the Advent of Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, the great Hindu reforming Saint, or even earlier under the Emperor Aśhoka, anti-religious forces built up in India as a reaction to extreme asceticism. Jainism had reached its spiritual height through the achievements of very few adherents, and was embraced by many government ministers. They created a sense of artificial and outwardly austere asceticism. The kings, feeling oppressed by this extremely unnatural lifestyle, gave royal support to Tantrism. Later on, many other Court officials also played a great role in creating the necessary atmosphere for Tantrism's rapid spread. In retrospect, by the 6th century, absurd monastic ways of life in the three official religions, Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, made people colorless and stereotypical. Ironically, all the three religions believed in the middle Path of Righteousness.

For seekers are a special category of people and, as such, they are very precious. William Blake describes them as "men of God".

He has written about this fourth dimension and has described it as the blessing of the Primordial Mother. The second person who was very well equipped with this knowledge, was Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya who has written many books. The first book he wrote was Vivekachūḍāmaṇi, in which he describes this fourth dimension and explains why we should try to attain this fourth dimension. An intellectual, one Mister Sharma, challenged him and told him that he could not do anything as an ascetic and win over my intellect. Thus he felt that for the common people all this discussion might just seem to be mental acrobatics. So he decided to write books just praising the Primordial Mother, especially in Saundaryalaharī, where he described all the Divine Vibrations as the vibrations of the loving beauty of the Primordial Mother.
