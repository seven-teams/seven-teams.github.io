He announced some prophecies which none of the incarnations, such as Jesus, had described. The first thing he said was that we must have Meerraj [Mirāj], meaning the ascent through different levels. And at the third level he described how he met with all the previous Prophets such as Ibrahim, and he described the ascent on the white horse which is actually the power of Kundalini [Kuṇḍalinī]. Secondly, he said that when you receive your realization you have to fully surrender, meaning "Islam", and then your hands will speak. He did not condemn any previous religion or incarnation. For example, the Kabe Makeshwara [Kaaba Makkeśhwara] is also described in the Indian Koran [Qur'ān]. And thirdly, he described the next advent that is going to come. He never said that he was the last one. What shows that he never said he was the last is that he said that I am the seal, meaning that he was the stamp of the Prophets. He described the work of the advent of Mandi [Mahdī]. The word of Mandi [Mahdī] actually means the incarnation of the great primordial Mother -- Ma + Adi [Ādi]. No one has prophesised [prophesized] so clearly about Sahaja Yoga except for Hazrate [Hazarat] Muhammad who has described Sahaja Yoga in his great book of Koran [Qur'ān]."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1901-0000 Letter Published in the Turkish Newspaper Bursa</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">"In the life of Jesus Christ (incarnation of Maha Vishnu) the highest expression of the essence of spiritual innocence came on this earth.

The crucifixion of Christ happened at a time when people knew about Go almighty the Father but did not know how to crucify their human self to make the spiritual self express itself; tis is the meaning of the Resurrection of Christ by which man could be the physical witness of the immortality of the spirit which does not suffer or perish.

The meeting is quoted from an ancient book of Purāṇas, in Sanskrit, which perhaps, the writer doesn't know. It is written that Śhālivāhana King asked Jesus his name, and he said his name was Īsā Masīh and he asked him: "Why are you here in this country?" He said: "I have come from a country where people are 'Mlecchas'. Mlecchas are the people who have a desire to be only filthy or to be vulgar and immoral." In those days, foreigners were all called "Mlecchas" in India because Indians believed that they had no idea of purification or transformation. Whatever may be the case, this was the conversion between Śhālivāhana and Lord Jesus Christ. So Śhālivāhana asked him: "Why you do not go back and cleanse these people and teach them about Nirmal Tattwa?" (means the Principle of Cleansing). Thus, I think Christ went back and was crucified within three and a half years by the Romans who were not keen about their salvation. Now the way the Church of England is trying to support illegal marriages, etc., taking the support of the gene's theory shows how the Indians were right calling the Westerners "Mlecchas." I have dealt with this gene's theory in the chapter of Metascience.<br /> ......<br /> Christ has said that you have to cleanse yourself, you have to control your attention and you have to see, through your introspection, what is wrong with you, and try to cleanse yourself. Otherwise, he said (in the chapter written by Matthew, in the Bible) "that if your one eye does the sin, (even if you look at a woman twice) you better take out your eyes. If your hand does anything wrong, anything sinful, cut out your hand." He said: if somebody slaps you on one cheek, to turn the other cheek to that person. Imagine Christians tolerating even one slap on the face?<br /> When you see the Christian people in the Christian nations, the way they killed people all over the world, one wonders, by what yard-stick they call themselves Christians. One can very well understand that these are all absolutely impossible rules and regulations for the advanced modern persons to follow. These hard rules may not have been propagated by Christ, but may have been introduced by Paul who was a squatter in the Bible and who edited it. He was epileptic according to the Principles of Sahaja Yoga. He was possessed and wrote all kinds of lies through Peter who was the weakest disciple of Christ. How could Christ give him the keys to build a church on seven hills? On the contrary, He said: "The Satan will take you over". Who is this Satan? The anti-Christ.<br /> It's not possible for anybody to be worthy of the Christian religion because they have to be extremely sensitive to sinful actions like Saints or angels. I haven't seen anybody with a cut hand or with eyes missing in the whole of the Christian kingdom. This proves that their belief in Christ is followed only up to the point of going to the church, listening to the sermons preached by a person who is not even a realized Soul, and who has not had his Divine Baptism.<br /> It is very surprising, because our mayor in Italy asked me: "How is it there are so many people attending your program for hours together. They never get bored. While when we are in the church, after fifteen minutes, we start looking at our watches, and after half an hour, we just run out of the church. It is just a social event but it so very boring that after the lecture we feel like going to the pub, otherwise we start fighting with each other." After the blessing of the Trinity, why should they be so anxious to drink and get lost?<br /> Thus, we find that, in the Christian countries, people are behaving in an absolutely opposite manner to what Christ had asked them to do. He had gone into a very subtle side of purity that says, "Thou shall not have adulterous eyes" while in the Ten Commandments, it was only said: "Thou shall not commit adultery". If you are observant, you will be shocked to see that it is very hard to find any man or woman in the Western countries who does not have adulterous eyes. Of course it is different, if they are blind, or too old to flirt with their eyes. They are always moving their eyes from one person to another person with lust or greed. It's impossible to understand how they can move their attention so fast from one person to another, unless some screws are loose in their brains, like a doll, which has screws that control the eye balls. The eyes start moving very fast like flirts. They might become mad or get possessed by one thing or another. In fruitless pursuit, how can the human attention be so mobile?<br /> After Christ came Muhammad Sāhib, and perhaps He felt that if all these rules and regulations were written down they were only for men. But what about the women? So He said something should be done about the women. If they follow an absolutely moral path, then men will be also automatically moral. He respected holy women. He had great respect for Christ's Mother and also for women as a whole. In the Bible She is called as an ordinary woman. The idea of Madonna came from the Pagan religion which existed before Christ. But Muhammad Sāhib, who was the Incarnation of the Primordial Master (Prophet), knew who was the Mother of Christ. In Sahaja Yoga She is worshiped as Mahālakṣhmī. He did not want many women to be immoral and take to prostitution. For a married woman, there are very strict punishments. It is said that in the Qur'ān He said: "Any woman, who is immoral, must be buried in the sand halfway and should be stoned," (sometimes, she could be dead.) I wonder if He said such a thing, or if it was Muʿāwiyah [ibn Abī Sufyān] who edited the Qur'ān. But the way they follow it in the Islamic countries is really sinful to give this kind of punishment to all those who are considered immoral women. Whatever it is, it is very difficult, in these modern times, to find very moral people after the pattern that Muhammad Sāhib thought.<br /> He accepted many marriages because He didn't want women to have relationship without marriage. In those days, there were many women who survived after the death of their husbands, in the wars they had among the tribes. There were many young girls who had no chance of marriage, as many young people were killed in the wars they had in the different tribes against Muhammad Sāhib. Whatever He did at that time (samayāchār), was very essential to create a new generation of very pure and compassionate people. Both Jesus Christ and Muhammad Sāhib were not only divine but they were Incarnations who had a Special Mission to come on this Earth. ......<br /> Now, in Islamic fundamentalism, the main problem Is that they say they are fighting the Western culture. Firstly, we must understand that Western culture, which today is nowhere near what Christ has talked about. Immorality has become the lifestyle of human beings in the West, but what about the immorality the Muslims are indulging in secretly whenever they get the chance? They can be worse than Christians.<br /> ......<br /> In these nations, in their private life, or in society can one find that they try to imbibe the great qualities that our Lord Jesus Christ has taught? Only in name are they followers of Christ; for political control, they use religions without any substance of these great religions. All of them are making money and are not willing to accept the universal pure innate religion, which is the fountain-head of all these religions. Their own standard of understanding moral life is really very shocking. For example, they believe in heavy drinking, because they say that in the Christian religion, drinking is allowed as Christ went to a wedding and there he made wine out of water. The word "wine" is used in the Hebrew language, even for grape juice, and also for grape wine.<br /> How did they interpret that he made Benedictine, French wine or Scotch Whisky. It is very simple to understand the logic that you cannot create alcoholic wine in a short time spontaneously. It has to ferment, and then it becomes a very good, expensive alcoholic wine that can cause intoxication. If it is a very, very old smelly, rotten wine, one can sell it for a very high price. This is not the same wine that was created by Christ at all. It is very easy to understand that he was constantly preaching for a higher awareness. Therefore how could he try to subscribe something like alcoholic intoxicating wine, which is anti-spiritual in nature and which reduces awareness.<br /> In Canada, I met a scholar who had a doctorate from some English university. To my surprise, he had written a thesis on how alcohol creates more awareness for Divinity. Moreover, many people in Europe believe that by taking drugs they can get a very high awareness to achieve their divine ascent. It is all absurdity to the last limit, but who can tell them. They can't talk to you after six o'clock anyway, especially in France, as they all start drinking quite early. It is impossible to understand why all these people have taken to drinking in the name of religion and even when they give the communion to God, which they call in their language, Holy Communion (it is given with wine and some sort of rotten bread). How can any one believe that this wine and alcohol, which makes a person so sick and causes so many diseases and which is so dangerous for children to consume, has something to do with the divine ascent, because it is the blood of Christ, our Lord. What an insult to the great life of Jesus, who was a pure Incarnation for innocence, Logos or Auṃ.<br /> ......<br /> On the whole, if you see, Western culture denies Christ who sacrificed his life for the sins of the people. Those who call themselves Christians indulge in all kinds of activities which are anti-Christ. When Christ came into this world in the Realm of Divinity, one had to go through penance (tapasyā). Buddha and Mahāvīra had to do the same at that time. Christians do not know what is penance and they cannot sacrifice even a pin for others. They are very good at lip service. Big conferences are held in the developing nations for monetary help, who pay for these conferences and the outcome is that nothing can be done for the poor countries while Westerners spend their superfluous money on all kinds of waste.<br /> ......<br /> Ego is against Christ. As they don't respect themselves they also do not respect others. Thus, the people in the West are extremely egoistical and arrogant. They feel that if somebody is humble, he is a weak person, while Christ has said: "The meek will inherit the Earth." They advertise openly about their ego and what things can please their ego. I have seen advertisements about smoking stating that it makes you look egoistical. The training of children in the West is to develop the ego and also, very surprisingly, children are told to grab things from others rather than to share with others. I am talking about democratic countries where there is no understanding of compassion and humility, although they are Christians they do not practice Christianity.<br /> So the fundamentalists of the Christian religion have now become a new type, those who believe in a new culture of people. They go to church with their skin heads and on their return they kill Hindu ladies who wear kumkum (mask of marriage). They worship Christ and call themselves "dot-busters" and look like lousy vagabonds. They never wear any suits anymore, neither do they have any proper dresses. They wear the same clothes for the whole year and hold very high positions in the media or in other organizations. People laugh at a person who is not in this kind of lousy, shabby, repulsive attire. One has to appear rustic and innocent like a primitive villager, while the brain is ultramodern. Islamic fundamentalists are fighting these Western modern fundamentalists who believe in all kinds of absurd modernism.<br /> Even in art, in writing and also in expression in different types of literature, you find that books which are popular are usually very grotesque.<br /> France is full of these ideas and perhaps all these ideas really come from France, where the politicians, at a very high position, have keeps. There is no ideal for the people to follow. Idealism ended with Marie Antoinette, who was killed by the public, who themselves, had become bourgeois. All their lives have changed and they have taken to all the mannerisms of the bourgeois which they condemned and therefore hanged their king and queen. Thus, we have a society of very licentious and vulgar people. The qualities that were very important in the West were given by Christ, but nobody cared for them.<br /> ......<br /> Actually Hazarat Muhammad never made Islam an exclusive religion in the Qur'ān. He very respectfully talked about Moses, Abraham, Christ and His Mother, one after another. Even so Muslims believe they are exclusive. Jews and Christians also believe theirs are exclusive religions. There is another problem -- they believe that Muhammad was the exclusive messenger of God and Christians believe that Christ is the last word, while Jews believe that their Savior has yet to come. If these Incarnations were the last ones why did Muhammad say, "I will send you the Twelfth Mahdī?" Also why did Christ say that He would send the Holy Ghost? We cannot say how long the Jews are going to wait for their Savior to come. They are wailing and crying before the wailing wall wearing the Torah in small amulets, but actually the most important thing for them is to collect the money that they have lent and buy diamonds at any cost.<br /> ......<br /> The Christians are converted in India. They usually come from very poor back grounds. They believe that Christ was an Englishman born in Buckingham Palace. There is a joke about a villager near Allahabad. He was converted and given the name Sikander (Alexander), so he became Alexander Bhura. Bhura was his own name meaning Blondy. Every time he came to Allahabad, he would go for a dip in the Holy River, the Ganges. The missionaries who converted him said that now that had become a Christian he could not worship the River Ganges. He was amazed at this absurd proposal and said in his village language: "I have become sāhib, but how can I leave my religion (dharma)?"<br /> ......<br /> Now we find statues of nude Mahāvīra everywhere, with his private parts shown meticulously, as if Mahāvīra was nothing but his private parts. This really irritates any sensitive person. Why should they insult Lord Mahāvīra like this? If you notice the work of Michelangelo who has done the Sistine Chapel so well, he did not show Christ or Mother Mary or the Father, God without clothes. He showed other people, but never them. So it is very insulting to see a Great Incarnation like Lord Mahāvīra exhibited in the nude all over in India."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1995-0929 Meta Modern Era, Chapter 6: Religions</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">"I have met many people who cannot accept the Truth because of their ego. Once a very rude and arrogant interviewer from the television came to interview me. Of course, most of them are brought up that way so one should criticize their stupidity. Now this one was very special. He asked me what was I doing in London or England. He said I should help my own poor, India. I told him: "I am not here of my choice but as my husband has been elected to a UN post with headquarters in London, I have to be with him. But I am in India every year at least for half a year". Very humbly I asked him: "Who is responsible for India's poverty? If a country has "guests" for three hundred years without any visa or immigration, how can you expect such a country to be rich? While all the wealth is sucked out of India without any consideration, who do you think will become poor and who will become rich?" He felt quite upset with this answer from an ordinary Indian housewife. Then he asked another question: "Why do you have such a large population in India?" I said very calmly: "Sir, I may say that for this overpopulation also perhaps you are responsible." The ego explosion of this English interviewer was really worth viewing in silence. He jumped with temper: "How do you put the blame on us for your mad population?" To this I answered with great peace. I said: "Sir, I read in the newspaper that in England, sorry, in London itself, two legal children are killed by their parents every week. So sir, please tell me which sane child would like to be born in a country where there is not an atmosphere of love for the children. Even the neighbors do not like children. If one has children one may not get a flat on rent. Perhaps children are very happy to be born in India to loving and caring parents. Children do not want to know what bank account one has. They want love which is the most valuable thing". All this answering made him mad with fury. So he attacked me: "I am told you do not take any money for Self-realization work. This no Anglo-Saxon brain can understand." I answered him very politely: "Sir, how much can you pay for Divine Love? How much did you pay to Christ? By the way can I now ask you a question?" He said: "Yes, go ahead". I asked: "Will you tell me which God has made this special Anglo-Saxon brain?" That settled him. He walked out with his gear and cameraman who never took any photographs. Later on people told me about him, and that he is called a Bulldog, even in the media.<br /> ......<br /> For example, the war in Bosnia is the misidentification of Croats, Muslims and Serbs. They follow the Christian and Muslim religions. The Croats are Catholic Christians but do they follow Christ? What about Muslims who believe in the Formless God and despite this fight for land? Actually, Muhammad never talked of an exclusive religion. He talked about Abraham, Moses and Christ in a series and the fourth was Himself. Even Christ talked about Abraham and Moses. Why do people who follow Moses, Christ or Muhammad fight? They have the same roots. At least these three religions should produce people who understand the oneness of their religions. Of course, the Hindu religion is not exclusive. It accepts all the religions but even Hindus in charge of religious affairs have made different laws for different religions. They are taking advantage of the minorities for votes in the Democracy."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1995-0929 Meta Modern Era, Chapter 7: Peace</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">"For example, some of them project a kind of missionary in a developing country who collects money by showing off Christ's compassion, etc. all the time. Substantial donations are collected and these are perhaps shared with the media. Altogether, this seems to be a profitable business. The media can build up even a Nobel Prize-winning image. No one knows where all this money is going and what is happening. There are no properly audited accounts. People who are sensitive, especially those in the West get very impressed by such persons. Once a missionary came to a conference and started saying: "You must think about the poorest of poor, you must take something out of your lunch for the poorest of poor" and so on and so forth. All the Western people in the audience heard these three or four sentences and, to our amazement, they started crying. They donated so much money to that missionary, and it is said that this missionary collects people from the streets, baptizes them, and converts them into Christians. Those who fall sick and die are buried or cremated unceremoniously. The media are promoting the images of such missionaries practically in every developing country.<br /> ......<br /> Muhammad Sāhib has talked about Abraham, Moses, Christ in a series as They came one after the other. He has talked about the Mother of Christ especially with great respect. In the Bible She is not given so much respect because of Paul who edited the Bible. She is just called "the woman". But Prophet Muhammad says that anyone who talks against this Holy Lady will be punished, or something to that effect. So one can see that Muhammad Sāhib never talked of an exclusive religion called "Islam" (i.e., I surrender to God Almighty). But so many followers of Islam are fighting the followers of other religions and even amongst themselves.<br /> ......<br /> "</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1995-0929 Meta Modern Era, Chapter 8: World Peace</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">"Śhrī Gaṇeśha establishes within you the higher self. The baser self which enjoys all baser things of lives are If you see Mona Lisa, I don't know, she cannot be an actress, she cannot be in any beauty contest. Her face is very serene, very motherly, very pure, her eyes, and that's why it is that she is eternally so much appreciated? The reason is, there is Gaṇeśha Principle in her. She's a mother. The story about that one is that this lady had lost her child and she would never smile, she would never cry and one little child was brought to her. She saw the child, and then the smile that came on her face of that love for the child is being depicted by this great artist, that's why people are appreciating it. You have seen in the West though the people don't show much interest in the mother-child relationships, anywhere you go, the mother and child theme is the best. They will show you a photograph, this is Mother and Child. This is Christ's Mother and Child. When Christ was brought down, the Mother is there. They have to have Mother and the Child Principle acting otherwise that picture is not regarded as something great. Or you have to have actually Christ who is a Gaṇeśha Principle Himself, to be shown. I haven't seen any picture as such of those days where these principles are not there. Even Picasso has used it. Even people who have been quite modern had to use this principle to popularize. But some people had used to popularize not the Gaṇeśha Principle, just anti-Gaṇeśha principles.

While we are so much attached to our children. What are we teaching them? Are we teaching them any sacrifices? Are we teaching them any sharing? Are we teaching them any tolerance? Are we teaching them forgiveness? Leave alone crucifixion, leave alone even little punishment, the child has now become the biggest ordeal for Sahaja Yogis. Everybody gets children.
