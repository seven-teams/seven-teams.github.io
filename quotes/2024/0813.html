It was in the twelfth century that a Great Incarnation of a Saint, Śhrī Gyāneśhwara (God of Knowledge) was born. He live[d] for only twenty-three years. They were three brothers and one sister. All of them were tortured by the dharma-mārtaṇḍas. Gyāneśhwara took the permission of His Guru (Master), who was His eldest brother, and wrote in the regional language a book called Gyāneśhwarī. In the sixth chapter He clearly wrote about Kuṇḍalinī but again the people in charge of religion (dharma-mārtaṇḍas) said that this chapter was not allowed to be read (niṣhiddha)."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1991-0700 Book `Sahaja Yoga', Chapter 2: Vishwa Nirmala Dharma</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">"Then came, in the Twelfth Century, a great Saint called Gyāneśhwara in Maharashtra. It was a tradition of his time that one Master of Nāth Pānthis could give Realization only to one disciple. This Master was not supposed even to talk about the fourth dimension to normal people. They were only told that they should remember God and should sing the praise of God. But He, the great poet and a very great Saint, Gyāneśhwara, felt that it was time that the subject of spiritual ascent should be made much more clear to people.<br /> In Gītā there is no description of the Kuṇḍalinī or of the awakening, though Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, at the very outset, has said that a person should achieve the state of Sthitapragñya, which means, the one who is balanced, through enlightenment by Divine Knowledge. All this was a description, but he did not talk about how it is brought about.<br /> It was Śhrī Gyāneśhwara who wrote a treatise on Gītā called as Gyāneśhwarī. In the sixth chapter he very sweetly described the nature of this fourth power, called the Kuṇḍalinī which rests in the triangular bone and the way it is awakened by some great Soul by which one gets his fourth state of awareness. He did not take permission from his guru to give Realization to others but he only asked that he should be permitted at least to write about it. Later on, this sixth chapter was not understood by the people who were in charge of religion (dharma-mārtaṇḍas). They said that this sixth chapter was not to be read (niṣhiddha) and thus this great chapter was completely neglected by the people and they just tried to follow the path of bhakti, which means devotion to God by chanting the names of God or singing the praise of God Almighty.<br /> There were three types of movements in our country. In the first one, people wanted to know about matter, the origin of matter, the origin of this world. In this quest they came to know how our right side is built up and what the elements that build our body are. The advancement on this knowledge led to science as a new field of study. Another aspect was constituted by people who were absolutely dedicated and were singing the praise of all Deities who were created by Mother Earth (Swayambhu). They sang praise of God and prayed to God Almighty in the way their gurus told them. There were also people in the middle path who were called the Nāth Pānthis, specially in Maharashtra. These were realized Souls who had received their Realization through the ``one guru, one disciple" principle. Saint Gyāneśhwara was also from the Nāth Sampradāya, meaning the Nāth Cult. He was a great exponent of Kuṇḍalinī awakening in his book."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1995-0929 Meta Modern Era, Chapter 9: Evolution</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><br /><p style="color:red;">Jay Śhrī Mātājī!<br /></p></font></p></section><footer class="page__meta"></footer><nav class="pagination"> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/quotes/2024/0812" class="pagination--pager" title="ŚHRĪ ĀDI ŚHAṄKARĀCHĀRYA in the Words of ŚHRĪ MĀTĀJĪ ">Previous</a> <a href="#" class="pagination--pager disabled">Next</a></nav></div></article></div><div class="page__footer"><footer><div class="page__footer-follow"><ul><li><strong>Follow:</strong></li><li><a href="/feed/festivity.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Festivity RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/compilation.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Compilations RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/quotes.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Quotes RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/scriptures.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Scriptures RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/yearly.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Yearly RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/divine.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Divine Message RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/chronology.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Photos RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/archives.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Archives RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/events.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Divine Events RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/news.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>News RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/folder.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Folder RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/chronology.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Chronology RSS Feed</a></li></ul></div><div class="page__footer-copyright"> Site content created by the Seven Teams. <br> Website powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" rel="nofollow">Jekyll</a> with <a href="https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io">AcademicPages</a> as a theme, modified by <a href="https://github.com/sean-7777">Sean Xiao</a>, and a fork of <a href="https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/" rel="nofollow">Minimal Mistakes</a>.</div></footer></div><script src="https://seven-teams.github.io/assets/js/main.min.js"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', '', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script src="https://unpkg.com/vanilla-back-to-top@7.2.1/dist/vanilla-back-to-top.min.js"></script> <script>addBackToTop()</script></body></html>
