This channel originates on the left side of the brain of the Primordial Being (<i>Virāṭa Śharīra</i>), and passes through the Ādi Āgñyā Chakra towards the right side of the Great Being's Body. In the Primordial Brain it forms the Universal Mind that thinks, organizes and creates the material side of creation. Hanumāna, the Monkey Deity, moves on this channel and represents the Preconscious Mind of the Virāṭa. <br /> ......<br /> Realized Souls who have reached the stage of God-realization, and on whom Brahmadeva bestows His Powers are very rare and never show off their tricks or <i>siddhis</i>, because these powers are not very important to them. This includes Deities and Incarnations like Hanumāna and Jesus Christ. These powers come to them as a part of their nature, and through them they can control the Sun, and the rain and other elements by the Grace of Brahmadeva.<br /> Powers like flying through the air, floating on water, being buried underground, stopping the sunrise or drinking up the oceans can also be performed with the help of disembodied spirits. It is easy to distinguish real Siddhas from impostors. Siddhas never use their powers for their betterment or fame or material well-being.
