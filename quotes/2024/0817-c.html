At this time, much before the seventh Incarnation of Śhrī Viṣhṇu as Lord Rāma, the Primordial Mother incarnated as the Goddess Durgā, Mother of the Universe. She incarnated from the Primordial Heart Center (Ādi Anāhata Chakra) called the Sacred heart in the Virāṭa. There have been one hundred and eight main Incarnations of the Goddess Durgā to save seekers from the evil of satanic forces.<br /> Maheśha (Śhiva), Viṣhṇu and Brahmadeva form the Trinity which incarnated as one teacher God, the Primordial Master, Dattātreya. He came onto this Earth to teach people the secrets of the Divine, to reveal God, and to help them cross the Ocean of Illusion themselves within their own identity. Evolution could not go further in the hands of human beings who were in the bondage of ignorance, so they were given guidance through this Incarnation of the Primordial Master (Ādi Guru) again and again in different lives. He was created as the three-headed child, Dattātreya, by Ādi Śhakti who appeared on Earth during the Tretā Yuga as Satī Anasūyā, wife of the Sage Atreya. He was born as Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara] who founded Jainism -- one of the oldest religions. Then he was born as Rāja Janaka, father of Jānakī also called Sītā, Rāma's wife. She was an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti.<br /> The Primordial Master was also born as Macchindranāth, and again as Zoroaster who was worshiped by the ancient Persians, and still revered by Parsis. Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism. In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates. He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā). Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918. Altogether there were ten major Avatāras of Dattātreya.<br /> It is very important to understand that until the animal stage there was no need for animals to solve the problem of life, as animals were under the complete command of God. At the human stage, however, as we learn from the history of Adam and Eve, they were given the choice and freedom to solve the problem of life. That was how evolution was to go a step further. Without such freedom human beings were not equipped to learn the secrets of Divine Power.<br /> Ādi Viṣhṇu Himself took His seventh Incarnation during the Tretā Yuga as Lord Rāma, a human being who crossed the Ocean of Illusion and touched a new dimension of awareness. As Śhrī Rāma, Ādi Viṣhṇu came to enlighten human social and political consciousness as the true model of what Plato, thousand of years later, would call 'the philosopher king'. He settled for human beings the rules of socio-political correct action (<i>samāj tatha rājkaraṇ dharma</i>). He also expressed God's aspect of majesty and order within kingship and institutions, and led a life of an ideal human being (<i>Maryādā Puruṣhottama</i>). This was witnessed by multitudes, resulting in a mass awareness for the first time among human beings. Śhrī Rāma was the ideal King for all kings, and <i>Rām Rājya</i>, His kingdom, was the ideal kingdom.<br /> He reached a point in the Primordial Heart Chakra (Ādi Anāhata Chakra) crossing the Void along the central path (Ādi Suṣhumṇā Nāḍī). His wife Sītā was an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. The <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i>, the epic about Lord Rāma's exploits written by Vālmīki, tells how Lord Rāma was made to forget that He was the Reincarnation of Ādi Viṣhṇu for some time, because it was desired that He should act absolutely like a human being, to make them feel absolutely free with him. He gave them a human leadership. Later on, when Sītā disappeared back into the Mother Earth, Lord Rāma remembered His divinity.<br /> At the time of Rāma's Incarnation Ādi Śhakti existed in three persons: Mahālakṣhmī, as Sītā, His wife; Mahāsaraswatī, as Satī Anasūyā who gave birth to Dattātreya, the Primordial Master; and Mahākālī as Mandodarī, the wife of the demon Rāvaṇa.<br /> ......<br /> Whilst Dattātreya's Incarnation was created in the Void, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's was at a much higher point, higher than even the Primordial Heart Chakra on which Lord Rāma took Incarnation. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's seat in the body of the Virāṭa is the Ādi Viśhuddhi Chakra, and is placed at the base of the neck inside the spinal cord. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was in fact the Complete Incarnation of the Virāṭa whose form (<i>swarūpa</i>) He showed in a vision to His disciple Arjuna. His teachings to Arjuna are compiled in the <i>Śhrī Bhagavad Gītā</i>. As the Embodiment of the Witness State He killed many male and female evil geniuses (rākṣhasas and rākṣhasīs), as Lord Rāma had done. These entities have to be killed and destroyed again and again whenever they come in the way of human evolution. Ādi Śhakti's Incarnations are also mostly to kill demons. <br /> The Incarnations of Rādhā show how the ideas of human beings gradually changed. The life as Rādhā was definitely a peg above in social advancement in the dogmatic thinking of society, compared to the time of Sītā. She was not married to Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa in a formal human way (<i>laukika</i>). Their wedding was divine (<i>alaukika</i>), and was performed spiritually and socially in the presence of many people by Brahmadeva. Earlier, as Sītā, although formally married to Rāma in a wedding ceremony that was collectively sanctioned, She was still condemned by society. Kṛiṣhṇa's love and adoration of Rādhā brought Her glory without marriage, while Sītā was denied that public acceptance even though She was the legal wife of Rāma.<br /> Princess Sītā was married to King Rāma in a very traditional way. When He went into exile, Rāvaṇa the rākṣhasa, Satan disguised as an ascetic, appeared before Her and took Her away to the capital of his kingdom in Lanka. Rāma fought a war with Rāvaṇa to rescue His wife, who was secluded by Rāvaṇa in the core of his island kingdom. Rāma defeated His enemy and brought Sītā back to His kingdom, Ayodhyā. Although She was the purest of the pure, and the holiest of the holy, She was treated with suspicion by the citizens of Ayodhyā, Rāma's capital city. They would not accept Her as queen, blaming Her for having been abducted by force by Rāvaṇa. The suspicious citizens questioned Her chastity, and committed collective sin by rejecting Her. Although She was pregnant Rāma was forced to forsake Her. She lived with the Saint Vālmīki in the jungles of Bihar State where She gave birth to twin boys, Lava and Kuśha. They were absolutely human personalities but of very great spiritual heritage from previous births. Sītā taught them the divine way of life. They were later born again in Bihar as Gautama, known as Lord Buddha, and as Śhrī Mahāvīra, the leader of the great religion, Jainism. This all happened 500 years before the birth of Christ. Internally they reached a very great height through these births. They preached the doctrine of nonviolence (<i>ahiṃsā</i>) which was later developed into an extreme form of vegetarianism. They took birth in the warrior caste (<i>Kṣhatriya</i>) rather than as fanatical Brahmins in order to keep away from the extremes of vegetarian abstinences, and to stay more balanced. Still their disciples carried their teachings to the extreme of abstinence and vegetarianism. They confused inner asceticism (<i>saṃnyāsa</i>) with organized institutions of asceticism, and nonviolence with vegetarianism. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was later very much criticized by the so-called vegetarian followers of Buddha and Mahāvīra.<br /> ......<br /> When one takes the name of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa one has to take the name of Rādhā first, so a seeker recites the mantra to the Virāṭa as 'Rādhā-Kṛiṣhṇa'. Similarly Sītā's name has to be taken before Rāma's for the mantra 'Sītā-Rāma'. Even the Virgin Mary (<i>Kanyā</i>) who was so quiet and potential at the time of Christ, was recognized later on by His disciples as the Power behind Him. She was worshiped for many years after Her death by early Christians. In modern times human beings who are satanic personalities are challenging the validity of the Primordial Mother's virginity and the Virgin Birth in particular. Mary has clearly shown the power of virginity that can raise a mother to such an exalted powerful position that she can conceive a child by desire alone. She had reached that high stage of evolution when by Her Divine Will, She could immaculately conceive. There are other such instances in Hindu purāṇik literature when Kuntī, by the wish of the Mantra, gave birth to the Pāṇḍavas and to Karṇa immaculately."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>The Book of Ādi Śhakti, Chapter 2: Divine Incarnations -- Ambassadors of God</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">"Tāntrikas controlled their spirits individually or in groups, and gave them mantras as code-names. One mantra for example, `{\it Auṃ Aim Hrīm Klīm Chāmuṇḍāya Vichai namaḥ}', is properly used to awaken Ādi Śhakti as Jagadambā or Chāmuṇḍā. This beautiful and powerful mantra should only be used by a realized Soul under the guidance of an evolved guru. But the same mantra was used by tāntrikas in such a way that each syllable was instrumental in summoning a group of dead spirits to be tamed and used by them. It is the same principle as giving your servant the name of a Deity, such as Rāma, which is quite a common usage in India. When you want your servant you call out the name of Rāma, and he is available at your beck and call. But God is not similarly available to every Tom, Dick or Harry. One has to be a realized Soul and have an authority to call God. Those who call Him without such authority will only succeed in summoning the services of dead spirits as slaves. Such dead beings will respond to a call for Rāma, if that was their name in earthly life. God however does not need the homage of such slaves."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>The Book of Ādi Śhakti, Chapter 6: Tantrism</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">"Rāja Yoga is a derivation of Haṭha Yoga. In this style of practice the gurus led lives like kings. They wore robes like royal personalities and ruled over the people. Rāja Janaka, another Incarnation of Dattātreya, was one such Rāja Yogi. In their inner life they were Yogis, but externally they led a royal existence, yet without attachment. They did not practice āsanas or Prāṇāyāmas, but they worshiped God through different styles of bowing. The Prophet Muhammad was the Incarnation of the same Primordial Master. He was married four times, but in His inner life He was completely detached. Śhrī Rāma's Incarnation also took place on the same channel and enlightened the path of Divine Kingship."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>The Book of Ādi Śhakti, Chapter 7: Haṭha Yoga and Rāja Yoga</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">"Emotional seekers who show off their love of seeking with many tears and much repentance, and who sing sad songs of separation, do not recognize God even when He stands before them.

His seventh Incarnation was as Śhrī Rāma who resides on the right side of the Heart chakra with His Power, Śhrī Sītā. Rāma incarnated as the representation of a personality who was the perfect male human being (<i>Maryādā Puruṣhottama</i>). Lord Viṣhṇu's eighth Incarnation was as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa who, with His Power Rādhā, resides on the Viśhuddhi chakra.

If they are particularly unkind to their mothers, then the center and right Heart gets very weak. We must therefore understand just how important our parents are, and how the spiritual link is held in the inner being of personality. Our parents have their roots in the Primordial Parents, and marriage has its roots in their primordial and eternal loving relationship. Those who do not respect their marriage, or enjoy the glory of their chastity, also suffer from a very weak Heart center and Mūlādhāra chakra.

For example when Śhrī Rāma was exiled and went to a forest, he met there a poor old woman called Śhabarī who was of tribal caste. She offered some berries to Śhrī Rāma with great affection and devotion. She said: ``Please eat them because they are not at all sour. I have already tasted them." The food or fruits tasted by somebody else are not to be eaten (uttiṣhṭa). If someone has bitten off even a part of a fruit, that fruit is no longer pure and cannot be offered to another person, certainly not to an Incarnation. But Śhrī Rāma was greatly moved by the love of the old lady. He accepted the berries with much joy and ate them. He praised their taste and gave some to his wife, Sītā. His brother Lakṣhmaṇ, felt rather jealous and asked for some berries for himself. There are many incidents where Śhrī Rām gets very friendly with people who were not of very high castes. Also his own Rāmāyaṇa, his life story, was written by a fisherman who was a dacoit. This fisherman was transformed into a Saint by another heavenly minstrel called Nārada. Of course an ordinary fisherman who was also a dacoit had such respect for Śhrī Rāma that he wrote this beautiful epic, the Rāmāyaṇa."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1995-0929 Meta Modern Era, Chapter 6: Religions</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p><br /></p><p style="color:red;">Jay Śhrī Mātājī!<br /></p></section><footer class="page__meta"></footer><nav class="pagination"> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/quotes/2024/0817-a" class="pagination--pager" title="ŚHRĪ LAKṢHMAṆA in the Words of ŚHRĪ MĀTĀJĪ ">Previous</a> <a href="#" class="pagination--pager disabled">Next</a></nav></div></article></div><div class="page__footer"><footer><div class="page__footer-follow"><ul><li><strong>Follow:</strong></li><li><a href="/feed/festivity.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Festivity RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/compilation.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Compilations RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/quotes.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Quotes RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/scriptures.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Scriptures RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/yearly.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Yearly RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/divine.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Divine Message RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/chronology.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Photos RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/archives.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Archives RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/events.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Divine Events RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/news.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>News RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/folder.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Folder RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/chronology.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Chronology RSS Feed</a></li></ul></div><div class="page__footer-copyright"> Site content created by the Seven Teams. <br> Website powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" rel="nofollow">Jekyll</a> with <a href="https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io">AcademicPages</a> as a theme, modified by <a href="https://github.com/sean-7777">Sean Xiao</a>, and a fork of <a href="https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/" rel="nofollow">Minimal Mistakes</a>.</div></footer></div><script src="https://seven-teams.github.io/assets/js/main.min.js"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', '', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script src="https://unpkg.com/vanilla-back-to-top@7.2.1/dist/vanilla-back-to-top.min.js"></script> <script>addBackToTop()</script></body></html>
