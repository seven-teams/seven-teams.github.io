What happened to their vigor [light] back then? All were so-called very great then. Nobody raised any point on that.<br /> To teach them a lesson Rādhājī did not marry Kṛiṣhṇa under the societal norms. But still, the whole world knows Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa as Rādhā-Kṛiṣhṇa.

Its pratīk [symbol] is that Rādhājī has to sit with Her legs in the river.

Rādhā (Mahālakṣhmī) as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's first and eternal love"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>The Book of Ādi Śhakti, Chapter 1: Creation, the Eternal Play</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">"Ādi Viṣhṇu's eighth form was as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa during the Dwāpara Yuga, and again Ādi Śhakti took three forms. Mahākālī lived for a very short time as Viṣhṇumāyā, the infant sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. She was actually born as the daughter of Yeśhodā, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's foster mother, and was killed by the demon Kaṃsa. She later took birth as Draupadī, wife of the Pāṇḍavas. Yeśhodā was Herself an Incarnation of Mahāsaraswatī. As Mahālakṣhmī She took two forms, Rādhā and Rukmiṇī. '<i>Rā</i> means power or energy and '<i>dhā</i>' means sustenance, so the name 'Rādhā' means the one who sustains the power. As Rukmiṇī She became Queen to Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, the King in Dvārakā.<br /> ......<br /> In their early days, Rādhā and Kṛiṣhṇa played a game of <i>Rāsa</i> (<i>rā</i> + <i>sa</i> &#8211; meaning 'with energy'). Rāsa is the play which manifests identification with the Power of God. It was the play of Sahaja Yoga, of the Divine Circuit of Vibrations. All Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's playmates were innocent, simple cow herders (<i>gopīs</i> and <i>gopas</i>). They did not know that he was trying to manifest the working of Sahaja Yoga (spontaneous growth of the inner self) through the play (<i>Līlā</i>) of Rāsa. It was a very simple game similar to 'Ring-A-Ring-A-Roses'.<br /> When Rādhā filled pitchers of water from the Yamunā River She automatically vibrated that water with Praṇava, as She was Ādi Śhakti and was carrying the water on Her head. When Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa broke the hers the vibrated water was meant to fall on the soil of Vṛindāvan where Kṛiṣhṇa and Rādhā lived, vibrating it. Similarly when Rādhā placed Her Feet in the Yamunā River, the waters of the river became vibrated. Se when the gopīs and their husbands, the simple folk of Vṛindāvan, carried water from the river in earthenware pitchers, Kṛiṣhṇa broke the pitchers so that the vibrated water would fall from their heads onto their spinal cord. Their Kuṇḍalinī would thus be awakened and raised, and they would get their Self-realization through the spontaneous awakening of Sahaja Yoga. It was sportive and playful baptism, but all these tricks or designs of Kṛiṣhṇa do not completely and immediately work out the whole manifestation of Sahaja Yoga. He could only sow the seed of Sahaja Yoga, His name meaning 'the One who sows' (<i>Kṛiṣhi</i>). The gopīs and gopas did get Kuṇḍalinī awakening which was a great achievement. The awakened state of their Kuṇḍalinī made the finite nature of human beings enlightened and enlarged their consciousness, but they still could not pierce into the infinite. That was left to be done after Kṛiṣhṇa's time, and thus awakened, their Kuṇḍalinīs needed many years of effort or many lives' experience to become receptive to Sahaja Yoga.<br /> The Incarnations of Rādhā show how the ideas of human beings gradually changed. The life as Rādhā was definitely a peg above in social advancement in the dogmatic thinking of society, compared to the time of Sītā. She was not married to Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa in a formal human way (<i>laukika</i>). Their wedding was divine (<i>alaukika</i>), and was performed spiritually and socially in the presence of many people by Brahmadeva. Earlier, as Sītā, although formally married to Rāma in a wedding ceremony that was collectively sanctioned, She was still condemned by society. Kṛiṣhṇa's love and adoration of Rādhā brought Her glory without marriage, while Sītā was denied that public acceptance even though She was the legal wife of Rāma.<br /> ......<br /> not live like Rādhā who did not bring forth Her only Son, Mahāviṣhṇu, on this Earth though She had created Him in the Body of the Virāṭa in the Vaikuṇṭha Stage. It was as a virgin that Mary conceived Jesus Christ, the ninth Incarnation of Ādi Viṣhṇu.<br /> The greatness of this Incarnation cannot be adequately described in words but in the <i>Devī Bhāgavatam</i> there is a passage about Christ. It tells how He was born in Heaven to Rādhā as Mahāviṣhṇu, the only Son of the Virāṭa. He is none other than Śhrī Gaṇeśha, the symbol of eternal childhood. His body was constructed from the body of Śhrī Kārttikeya who was Brahma Himself, the only brother of Śhrī Gaṇeśha, and was conceived by one-sixteenth part of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, the Virāṭa, who was His Father. As Mahāviṣhṇu He is the sustainer (<i>āśhraya</i>) of the whole world. A father always wants his son to be greater than himself, so Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa gave His Son a boon making Mahāviṣhṇu a million times greater than Himself and promising to place Him even higher than Himself. His Being would contain unlimited Brahmā, Viṣhṇu and Maheśha (Śhiva), and from His forehead Eleven Rudras would be created when the last day of destruction will come.<br /> Rādhā in Mary's Incarnation wanted to give Her Son the name of Her Lord, Kṛiṣhṇa. Kṛiṣhṇa comes from '<i>kṛiṣhi</i>' + '<i>ṇa</i>'. '<i>Kṛiṣhi</i>' means farming, '<i>ṇa</i>' means the one who carries. So the name 'Christ' came from the 'kṛiṣhi' in Kṛiṣhṇa. The name Jesus was derived from Jasodā, a form of Yeśhodā, the foster mother of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. Rādhā also wanted to give Yeśhodā's name to Her Son because of Yeśhodā's devotion and worship of Her in Vṛindāvan and Gokul. The abbreviation of Yeśhodā was 'Jesu' or 'Yesu', so Rādhā/Mary named Her Son Jesus Christ.<br /> In the life of Jesus Christ, the highest expression of the essence of spiritual innocence came onto Earth as God the Son. Human beings witnessed the sacrifice of the dearest and Only Son of the Father (Virāṭa) for humanity's sake. This allowed a deeper human perception of God's great love for the human race. The crucifixion of Christ happened at a time when people knew about God the Father, but did not know how to crucify their human self to allow the spiritual Self to express itself. This is the real meaning of the Resurrection of Christ: that man could be the physical witness of the immortality of the Spirit which does not suffer and never perishes. For the first time, human awareness registered the Truth of the immortality of Spirit which Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa had preached in His lifetime, which is recorded in the <i>Bhagavad Gītā</i> written by the poet Vyāsa.<br /> When one takes the name of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa one has to take the name of Rādhā first, so a seeker recites the mantra to the Virāṭa as 'Rādhā-Kṛiṣhṇa'. Similarly Sītā's name has to be taken before Rāma's for the mantra 'Sītā-Rāma'. Even the Virgin Mary (<i>Kanyā</i>) who was so quiet and potential at the time of Christ, was recognized later on by His disciples as the Power behind Him. She was worshiped for many years after Her death by early Christians. In modern times human beings who are satanic personalities are challenging the validity of the Primordial Mother's virginity and the Virgin Birth in particular. Mary has clearly shown the power of virginity that can raise a mother to such an exalted powerful position that she can conceive a child by desire alone. She had reached that high stage of evolution when by Her Divine Will, She could immaculately conceive. There are other such instances in Hindu purāṇik literature when Kuntī, by the wish of the Mantra, gave birth to the Pāṇḍavas and to Karṇa immaculately.<br /> Rādhā had created Her Only Son, Mahāviṣhṇu, in the Vaikuṇṭha Stage but as Rādhā She could not conceive a child because She was unmarried. As Mary, though, She conceived Her child outside marriage in complete virginity. This is an expression of the power of virginity, the sinless Immaculate Conception. In Mary's life the greatest advancement in social consciousness regarding the power of chastity came about, and society went through yet another evolution. Though a virgin She was raised to such an exalted position by the birth of Christ that She was acceptable to public opinion as the Mother of God, not just then but still today."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>The Book of Ādi Śhakti, Chapter 2: Divine Incarnations &#8211; Ambassadors of God</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">"$\bullet$ They fabricated many salacious stories about Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, Śhrī Rādhā and the gopīs.

He is the complete manifestation of the Son God Principle. His body was formed from Śhrī Kārttikeya, the only brother of Śhrī Gaṇeśha and a Divine Personality. Although He came as a human being His Resurrection was made possible by the divine substance of His human body. In the Vaikuṇṭha Stage He was created as Mahāviṣhṇu, the only Son of Kṛiṣhṇa and Rādhā.
