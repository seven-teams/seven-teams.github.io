The injustice that was done to Her by the society, made Her leave the house, by accusing Her falsely, disgraced Her. Why back then these great people had a blindfold on? Why didn't they said, that, 'She is our Mother? You are asking Her to leave the house?' She already had passed the test, bypassing the fire, why were they dumbfounded then? What happened to their vigor [light] back then? All were so-called very great then. Nobody raised any point on that.<br /> To teach them a lesson Rādhājī did not marry Kṛiṣhṇa under the societal norms. But still, the whole world knows Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa as Rādhā-Kṛiṣhṇa. But for Him, the formal marriage is important, that's why there was no child.<br /> But in the next life, She came as Mary and Her Child glorified Her, who was a Virgin.<br /> Not a difficult thing to have a child as a virgin. If you are a realized Soul, then you are at that state, as these days I give birth to thousands from My Sahasrāra. Not a difficult thing. But She did it. Not difficult if someone wants to birth a child from Her womb. She did it without any difficulty.<br /> Even though in the world's eyes, in society's norm it is not OK, but now the world recognizes Mary as a great woman. People call Her Divine Mother.

She incarnated in the Middle Eastern Kingdom of Judea. In that life She did not marry and did not live like Rādhā who did not bring forth Her only Son, Mahāviṣhṇu, on this Earth though She had created Him in the Body of the Virāṭa in the Vaikuṇṭha Stage. It was as a virgin that Mary conceived Jesus Christ, the ninth Incarnation of Ādi Viṣhṇu.<br /> The greatness of this Incarnation cannot be adequately described in words but in the <i>Devī Bhāgavatam</i> there is a passage about Christ. It tells how He was born in Heaven to Rādhā as Mahāviṣhṇu, the only Son of the Virāṭa. He is none other than Śhrī Gaṇeśha, the symbol of eternal childhood. His body was constructed from the body of Śhrī Kārttikeya who was Brahma Himself, the only brother of Śhrī Gaṇeśha, and was conceived by one-sixteenth part of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, the Virāṭa, who was His Father. As Mahāviṣhṇu He is the sustainer (<i>āśhraya</i>) of the whole world. A father always wants his son to be greater than himself, so Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa gave His Son a boon making Mahāviṣhṇu a million times greater than Himself and promising to place Him even higher than Himself. His Being would contain unlimited Brahmā, Viṣhṇu and Maheśha (Śhiva), and from His forehead Eleven Rudras would be created when the last day of destruction will come.<br /> Rādhā in Mary's Incarnation wanted to give Her Son the name of Her Lord, Kṛiṣhṇa. Kṛiṣhṇa comes from '<i>kṛiṣhi</i>' + '<i>ṇa</i>'. '<i>Kṛiṣhi</i>' means farming, '<i>ṇa</i>' means the one who carries. So the name 'Christ' came from the 'kṛiṣhi' in Kṛiṣhṇa. The name Jesus was derived from Jasodā, a form of Yeśhodā, the foster mother of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. Rādhā also wanted to give Yeśhodā's name to Her Son because of Yeśhodā's devotion and worship of Her in Vṛindāvan and Gokul. The abbreviation of Yeśhodā was 'Jesu' or 'Yesu', so Rādhā/Mary named Her Son Jesus Christ.<br /> In the life of Jesus Christ, the highest expression of the essence of spiritual innocence came onto Earth as God the Son. Human beings witnessed the sacrifice of the dearest and Only Son of the Father (Virāṭa) for humanity's sake. This allowed a deeper human perception of God's great love for the human race. The crucifixion of Christ happened at a time when people knew about God the Father, but did not know how to crucify their human self to allow the spiritual Self to express itself. This is the real meaning of the Resurrection of Christ: that man could be the physical witness of the immortality of the Spirit which does not suffer and never perishes. For the first time, human awareness registered the Truth of the immortality of Spirit which Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa had preached in His lifetime, which is recorded in the <i>Bhagavad Gītā</i> written by the poet Vyāsa.<br /> When one takes the name of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa one has to take the name of Rādhā first, so a seeker recites the mantra to the Virāṭa as 'Rādhā-Kṛiṣhṇa'. Similarly Sītā's name has to be taken before Rāma's for the mantra 'Sītā-Rāma'. Even the Virgin Mary (<i>Kanyā</i>) who was so quiet and potential at the time of Christ, was recognized later on by His disciples as the Power behind Him. She was worshiped for many years after Her death by early Christians. In modern times human beings who are satanic personalities are challenging the validity of the Primordial Mother's virginity and the Virgin Birth in particular. Mary has clearly shown the power of virginity that can raise a mother to such an exalted powerful position that she can conceive a child by desire alone. She had reached that high stage of evolution when by Her Divine Will, She could immaculately conceive. There are other such instances in Hindu purāṇik literature when Kuntī, by the wish of the Mantra, gave birth to the Pāṇḍavas and to Karṇa immaculately.<br /> Rādhā had created Her Only Son, Mahāviṣhṇu, in the Vaikuṇṭha Stage but as Rādhā She could not conceive a child because She was unmarried. As Mary, though, She conceived Her child outside marriage in complete virginity. This is an expression of the power of virginity, the sinless Immaculate Conception. In Mary's life the greatest advancement in social consciousness regarding the power of chastity came about, and society went through yet another evolution. Though a virgin She was raised to such an exalted position by the birth of Christ that She was acceptable to public opinion as the Mother of God, not just then but still today.<br /> Through a deeper understanding of Sahaja Yoga the reader will grasp the simplicity of the Immaculate Conception. Mary proved She was the Primordial Mother by conceiving the child in Her Sacred Heart (Primordial Heart Chakra). The Sacred Heart is the place where the Mother of the Universe (Jagadambā) exists. In the same way that She conceived the universe She also conceived Jesus Christ, and moved it through the Ādi Suṣhumṇā Nāḍī into the Ādi Swādhiṣhṭhān Chakra which controls the Primordial Uterus (<i>Kumbha</i>) to give Him human birth as a baby. In that divine heaven of creativity the Immaculate Conception took the form of a zygote egg (<i>Aṇḍam</i>). It remained in that state for many ages (<i>Kalpas</i>) until Ādi Śhakti took birth as Mary. She then manifested it as Jesus Christ. It was not difficult for Ādi Śhakti to do that. Unfortunately the greatness of Her Powers was only recognized after She departed from the Earth."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>The Book of Ādi Śhakti, Chapter 2: Divine Incarnations &#8211; Ambassadors of God</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">"Their entry occurs through the Āgñyā chakra, known as the 'third eye'. This is the center Indian ladies traditionally cover by a vermilion <i>tilak</i>, or <i>bindi</i>. Many English people laugh at this mark, some even foolishly make fun of Indians who wear it. This mark keeps the entry of spirits away, and is the mark of the Primordial Mother. It is the mark of the Virgin Mary who sacrificed Her blood, Her only child, to save humanity. She wore the mark of the Precious Blood running in the body of Her Son, Jesus Christ. It is He who guards the subtle center of Āgñyā, and protects from spirits entering there."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>The Book of Ādi Śhakti, Chapter 5: The Subconscious and the Collective Subconscious</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">"Ancient Sages, who meditated and achieved great heights of awareness, have written a lot about Kuṇḍalinī. Living away from the public in forest dwellings they saw the working of Kuṇḍalinī within themselves during meditation. Apart from descriptions in ancient Indian Scriptures, Kuṇḍalinī has also been described in religious books like the Torah, the Bible and the Qur'ān as 'the fire tree'. In those books there are many references couched in secretive language which few would have understood. The Bible tells of the first meeting of all the disciples with the Virgin Mary after the Crucifixion. The closed room they met in 'was filled with a great wind, and there appeared above their heads, as it were, separate tongues of fire, and they were filled with the Holy Ghost.' This is a description of a vision of Kuṇḍalinī. Various Chinese philosophers have also described the Kuṇḍalinī in their writings, and Greek mythology cataloged the same Gods and Goddesses I have written about in the chapter on Creation. The Zen Buddhist religion teaches very clearly that the basis of Buddhist meditation is the science of Kuṇḍalinī.<br /> ......<br /> These Deities also manifest Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa with His Power Rādhā, and the Lord Jesus Christ, whose Power is His Mother Mary (Mahālakṣhmī Herself).<br /> ......<br /> The other Deities remain on their different centers:<br /> &emsp;1. <i>Sahasrāra chakra</i> &#8211; Ādi Śhakti Herself<br /> &emsp;2. <i>Āgñyā chakra</i> &#8211; Jesus Christ + His Mother Mary<br /> ......"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>The Book of Ādi Śhakti, Chapter 9: The Creation of Kuṇḍalinī in Human Beings</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">"This Mūlādhāra chakra is made from the first syllable 'A' of the tripartite sacred syllable, 'Auṃ'. Each syllable is a mantra. The mantra 'A' represents the Mahākālī Power of Ādi Śhakti, and the Mūlādhāra chakra was created by Mahākālī as Gaurī, who is Śhrī Gaṇeśha's Mother. Later on She hands over Her only child to Mahālakṣhmī, who as the Virgin Mary gives birth to Him as Jesus Christ."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>The Book of Ādi Śhakti, Chapter 12: Mūlādhāra Chakra</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">"Now we find statues of nude Mahāvīra everywhere, with his private parts shown meticulously, as if Mahāvīra was nothing but his private parts.

But Prophet Muhammad says that anyone who talks against this Holy Lady will be punished, or something to that effect. So one can see that Muhammad Sāhib never talked of an exclusive religion called ``Islam" (i.e., I surrender to God Almighty). But so many followers of Islam are fighting the followers of other religions and even amongst themselves."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1995-0929 Meta Modern Era, Chapter 8: World Peace</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">"Śhrī Gaṇeśha establishes within you the higher self. The baser self which enjoys all baser things of lives are If you see Mona Lisa, I don't know, she cannot be an actress, she cannot be in any beauty contest. Her face is very serene, very motherly, very pure, her eyes, and that's why it is that she is eternally so much appreciated? The reason is, there is Gaṇeśha Principle in her. She's a mother. The story about that one is that this lady had lost her child and she would never smile, she would never cry and one little child was brought to her. She saw the child, and then the smile that came on her face of that love for the child is being depicted by this great artist, that's why people are appreciating it. You have seen in the West though the people don't show much interest in the mother-child relationships, anywhere you go, the mother and child theme is the best. They will show you a photograph, this is Mother and Child. This is Christ's Mother and Child. When Christ was brought down, the Mother is there. They have to have Mother and the Child Principle acting otherwise that picture is not regarded as something great. Or you have to have actually Christ who is a Gaṇeśha Principle Himself, to be shown. I haven't seen any picture as such of those days where these principles are not there. Even Picasso has used it. Even people who have been quite modern had to use this principle to popularize. But some people had used to popularize not the Gaṇeśha Principle, just anti-Gaṇeśha principles.
