I will tell you about it in the evening. Now, please do this little job for Me. There is milk in this bowl. You take this bowl and come along with Me. Please see that not a single drop of milk is spilled on the earth. Then only will I tell you why I am called Videha."<br /> Nārada took the bowl and followed Janaka everywhere. He had to be very careful because the bowl was such that by the slightest movement the milk might have spilled. He got quite tired.<br /> When they retired for the evening Nārada asked, "Please tell me now. I am getting quite fed up with carrying this bowl of milk and following You everywhere at the same time." Rāja Janaka said, "First of all, tell Me what you have seen?" Nārada replied, "Nothing except this bowl of milk so that it won't spill." Rāja Janaka said, "Didn't you see that there was a big procession in My honor? Then there was a court wherein there was a program of dancing? Didn't you see anything?" Nārada answered, "No, Sir. I have not seen anything." Rāja Janaka said, "My child, likewise with Me.

In the center is the seat of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, and on it Śhrī Brahmadeva creates the whole universe. He made this Bhavasāgara.<br /> After creating the Bhavasāgara, the question was, 'How to cross it over? The human being was created, but how to make him realize it? How to make human beings recognize it? In him, how to activate the Brahma Tattwa?' Meaning, 'How to get the Union of Śhiva and Śhakti within him? How would the connection be established?'<br /> For this, a special personality was created in this world. This was created by the combined essence of Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, and Maheśh, who we acknowledge as Śhrī Dattātreya. Śhrī Dattātreya is none other than Ādi Guru.<br /> He is My Guru. He has mentored Me all His past lives.<br /> If you hear about His birth and all His previous lives you would be amazed.

Śhrī Sītājī was His daughter, who was the embodiment of Śhakti Herself.</font> Then He came as Macchindranāth, Zoroaster, and Muhammad Sāhab, who were a completely different type of human being.<br /> They trialed out lots of different things.<br /> Śhrī Datta, the Primordial Masters firstly in this world educated us about the symbolic forms within us. And then also said that, "You people got entangled in symbolism, in idol worshiping." Their meaning was to go beyond and recognize the Śhakti within these idols. That's why They talked about the idols.<br /> <font color="red">For example, there is a flower, and to describe the honey within the flower, They talked about the flower first, from which the people would taste the honey. But people got stuck to flower. So Then they took Incarnations and talked about the honey.<br /> In that, They talked about God in the abstract. They deliberately didn't talk about the reincarnation of life.</font><br /> Because as soon as you talk about past lives, people ask Me, "Mātājī, tell me about my past lives." The life that has passed, why do you want to know that? Whether you were a king or a pauper, what difference it will make?<br /> <font color="red">That's why They did not discuss past lives.<br /> Muhammad Sāhab was the same, Dattātreya's Incarnation, and the same Incarnation was King Janaka.</font> The same Incarnation was Nāṇaka, whose sister Nāṇakī, was the same Ādi Śhakti.

King Janaka was the father of Jānakī [Śhrī Sītā]. He was none other than the Incarnation of Śhrī Dattātreya.</font><br /> Thereafter, Macchindranāth, most have you must have heard His name, was also His Incarnation.<br /> After that Zoroaster who came three times on the Earth, He was also His Incarnation.<br /> ......<br /> <font color="red">They were all Muhammads, They were all Dattātreyas, who came on Earth regularly.</font><br /> ......<br /> <font color="red">The talk of seeking this Absolute Principle, residing just inside the heart, has been made since ancient times by these Ādi Gurus, who are incarnated on this Earth again and again.</font><br /> ......<br /> <font color="red">For this reason I will give an example of King Janaka. Once a very great arch called Nachiketa went to the King Janaka. He was first suspicious and eager. He asked his guru, "Why do you pay visit to Him since He is a householder and also a king and then why do you bow down before Him and touch His Feet? He is a householder person!" Then he replied, "OK, you should go to the place of King Janaka and stay there. You know that He is called as a Videhi [Videha, incorporeal], He was a dehati [a country person]."<br /> When Nachiketa lived with Him then he saw that there was so much wealth, people were eating and living comfortably. The King enjoyed all type of meals. He roams and has children, such a Man, and how it is possible that this Man should know God?<br /> Next day he told that, "I am leaving just now, I'm just leaving now. I do not have to live here." Then King said, "OK, let's go for a bath first." They went to bath in a river. He took him to Sharayū [Sarayū] River for bath. While bathing in a river, suddenly somebody informed that, "O Lord, Your palace is on fire." King Janaka said, "Let it be, just now I'm in meditation," He replied with a smile. This poor Nachiketa got little worried. After a while people told that, "All of Your family member have to run away and fire is fast approaching You." Then He said, "To hell with it, now I'm in meditation." Afterwards they said that, "Fire has reached up to here and all Your ornaments and clothes will get burnt." All the bodyguards also ran away. This Nachiketa, whose one or two clothes were lying outside, he thought that, 'If these too were burnt, then what will happen to him [me]?' So he also ran outside. He picked up all his clothes. Even then He was in meditation.<br /> When He came back, Nachiketa was very much surprised. He asked, "King, do You have not any worry that had Your clothes been burnt then would You have moved just in this way?" Then He replied, "What is myth is going to be perished. There is no need to save it, till it is there keep it there or if it is not there then leave it."</font><br /> This is a true fact. Those gurus who do not consider myth as myth, then what are you going to find in them?" <font size="+0"><b>1973-1209 Public Program (Hindi), Day 3, Śhrī Dattātreya Jayanti, Biralā Krīṛā Keṃdra, Chowpatty, Girgaum Chowpatty, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> "Many people have said this many times and if you look at all the great men of religion (dharm puruṣho), no one of Them took to saṃnyās.

Because He is the father-in-law of Rāma, that's why you do it, is it?"<br /> He said, "No. Not because of that, because He is Videhi. He is the One only who can give Realization.

Surrounded by gold and everything, He is sitting down here. And He is supposed to be the Greatest Yogi of the ages. How is He called a Videhi?"<br /> Because He was a king, that was His life, and that's what He was like that. He was not taking money from anybody else's, OPM, other people's money.

Just now I'm meditating." He didn't say a word. And, "Don't disturb Me." Still He was meditating. Then the message came that, "Your people have all come out of the palace and they are going away."
