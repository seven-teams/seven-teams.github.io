Now, Buddha was the ... one of the very Great Incarnations in the sense that He was the son, one of the sons of Rāma, who incarnated on this Earth, Buddha, to occupy the highest life on this Earth. So He had to take saṃnyāsa. Because without that He could not show that.<br /> But there was no need for anybody else to take saṃnyāsa.<br /> But in His case mistakes, uh-uh-uh I mean why there were some mistakes about things were, because when He tried all these tricks of saṃnyāsa, going here and there, He never realized that this is all not needed.<br /> He was so tired and fagged out, that suddenly, spontaneous, the Primordial Mother Herself gave Him the Realization. Because He was so tired.<br /> Now, supposing this is Caxton Hall. To come here, you go to, say, uh-uh-uh-uh Reading, then you go to-oo, in the north, to Leeds, then you go this side and uh-uh-uh then you go to Brighton and come back here. And you tell everybody, "If you have to go to Caxton Hall, you better do all that." It is just like that! It is just like that, very misleading!<br /> Because when He found it out, as you have found out too, you do not realize how you have found it. You do not know how you have done it. If I do not tell you that it is God who has done it, how are you going to believe it? You'll think, 'I have done Self-realization, all right, I am a self-realized person.'<br /> Self is most important.<br /> That's why He believed this a ... anīśhwaratv, means atheism. He said, "There's no God. Only thing, the Self is to be achieved."<br /> Naturally. Because there was nobody to tell Him that, 'You have achieved through the Grace of the Primordial Mother.'<br /> So He was to be born again as one of the sons of Fāṭimah Bi, who was the daughter of Muhammad Sāhab. <font color="red">Then again He was to be born as Mārkaṇḍeya, and again as Śhaṅkarāchārya: just to neutralize what He has been preaching.</font><br /> So you will see that in the sixth century Śhaṅkarāchārya is the one who put end to Buddhism, the nonsense of Buddhism in India. Because, apart from what Buddha's understanding of the whole thing is, the His disciples made it so perverse, that somebody had to come down to tell: that, 'The marriage system has to be re-established.'<br /> And this is how this right side was controlled through various Incarnations coming down."<br /> <font size="+0"><b>1979-0611 Public Program, How Aspects of God Are Expressed within Us, Caxton Hall, 10 Caxton Street, Westminster, London, UK</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> "Is a technique which is written in all the Scriptures.

The first Power is that of Śhrī Gaṇeśha, who is recognized as His Original Power, and the other is that of Śhrī Kārttikeya.<br /> Because of this, the Incarnation of Jesus Christ is of complete Brahman Tattwa or Oṃkār.<br /> Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, He being the Father of Jesus Christ, bestowed a number of boons on Jesus Christ prior to His birth.<br /> <font color="red">One of these boons was that, "You would dwell on a plane higher than that of mine."</font><br /> This could be explained to mean, that while the plane of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa is the Viśhuddhi chakra, located at the base of our neck, the plane of Jesus is Āgñyā chakra, which is located at the junction of the optic thalamus.<br /> <font color="red">The second boon granted by Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was that, "You would be the support of the whole universe."<br /> The third boon was, that, "You would be the first to receive one-sixteenth part of all the offerings made to Me in Pūjā."<br /> In this way, after bestowing a number of boons, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa permitted Śhrī Jesus Christ to incarnate on the Earth.<br /> You would understand these things better, if you read Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa. Śhrī Mārkaṇḍeya, the author of the Purāṇa has beautifully explained a number of such subtler points.<br /> In the same Purāṇa, there is a graphic description of Śhrī Mahāviṣhṇu. If you would listen to this description while in meditation, you would notice that the description is of Jesus Christ only.</font>"<br /> <font size="+0"><b>1979-0927 Talk to Sahaja Yogis (Hindi), Kuṇḍalinī and Lord Jesus Christ, Navarātri Celebrations (6th Day), Hinduja Auditorium, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> "So all these experimentations are of no use.<br /> As a Mother I'm telling you, 'Please stop it.' Awaken your Lord Gaṇeśha within you, by respecting your chastity!<br /> Our Indian men think that, 'Chastity has no nuh-neah ... no meaning for them. Only the women have to be chaste, and men are not supposed to be chaste at all'! Is more surprising.<br /> Chastity is the most important thing for human beings, to be in the center, because it is Śhrī Gaṇeśha's blessings one gets, then only the Kuṇḍalinī is going to rise.<br /> Now, Śhrī Gaṇeśha has incarnated in this Earth ... on this Earth Himself as Lord Jesus Christ. He came on this Earth as Lord Jesus Christ on this center, what you call the Āgñyā chakra, where I am putting this red thing.<br /> But He has evolved a lot. There are Eleven Rudras, as we call them Ekādeśha [Ekādaśha] Rudras, which are His Powers.<br /> <font color="red">All this is described in the Devī Māhātmyam, Devī Bhāgavat[am]. His name is Mahāviṣhṇu. He is called as the Support of the Universe.<br /> But who reads Devī Bhāgavat[am]? Or who reads Mārkaṇḍeya's books or Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya's books?<br /> They will uh say that, 'We are great Hindus,' and they have not even heard the name of Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya!</font><br /> I went to Kerala and these newspaper people told Me that, "We have never read Him."<br /> In Kerala, such a great man was born, Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, I mean they have not read about Him!<br /> He never preached any Hinduism, it's a wrong idea! He said, "Na Yogen na Sāṅkhyen" [part of line 1 of Vivekachūḍāmaṇi 56]. He said, "Not by these philosophies you are gore ... you are going to gain [get] to God. But through Mother's Grace only you will gain that position."<br /> He's clearly said it. He never believed in any such secular uh-uh-uh sort of ideas or any such ideas which meant that, 'This religion is different.'

Because He is from the very beginning. As Gaṇeśha is Ādhā-rā and as Christ also is Ādhār.<br /> But what you have done of Him, His spirit, His intellect. So give anything to human beings, and they'll make up with a laugh of it. Just think: the brain is like that. I don't know how you can do that to Him.

They have achieved individual salvation of a very high degree while you have achieved your collective salvation better. But individually, they are of a very-very high quality. I mean, They had no doubts about Divine Power, They had no doubts about God. They never had any doubts. And They were very dignified. And They never bothered as to Their petty problems of life.
