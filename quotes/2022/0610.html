Now, Buddha was the ... one of the very Great Incarnations in the sense that He was the son, one of the sons of Rāma, who incarnated on this Earth, Buddha, to occupy the highest life on this Earth. So He had to take saṃnyāsa. Because without that He could not show that.<br /> But there was no need for anybody else to take saṃnyāsa.<br /> But in His case mistakes, uh-uh-uh I mean why there were some mistakes about things were, because when He tried all these tricks of saṃnyāsa, going here and there, He never realized that this is all not needed.<br /> He was so tired and fagged out, that suddenly, spontaneous, the Primordial Mother Herself gave Him the Realization. Because He was so tired.<br /> Now, supposing this is Caxton Hall. To come here, you go to, say, uh-uh-uh-uh Reading, then you go to-oo, in the north, to Leeds, then you go this side and uh-uh-uh then you go to Brighton and come back here. And you tell everybody, "If you have to go to Caxton Hall, you better do all that." It is just like that! It is just like that, very misleading!<br /> Because when He found it out, as you have found out too, you do not realize how you have found it. You do not know how you have done it. If I do not tell you that it is God who has done it, how are you going to believe it? You'll think, 'I have done Self-realization, all right, I am a self-realized person.'<br /> Self is most important.<br /> That's why He believed this a ... anīśhwaratv, means atheism. He said, "There's no God. Only thing, the Self is to be achieved."<br /> Naturally. Because there was nobody to tell Him that, 'You have achieved through the Grace of the Primordial Mother.'<br /> So He was to be born again as one of the sons of Fāṭimah Bi, who was the daughter of Muhammad Sāhab. <font color="red">Then again He was to be born as Mārkaṇḍeya, and again as Śhaṅkarāchārya: just to neutralize what He has been preaching.</font><br /> So you will see that in the sixth century Śhaṅkarāchārya is the one who put end to Buddhism, the nonsense of Buddhism in India. Because, apart from what Buddha's understanding of the whole thing is, the His disciples made it so perverse, that somebody had to come down to tell: that, 'The marriage system has to be re-established.'<br /> And this is how this right side was controlled through various Incarnations coming down."<br /> <font size="+0"><b>1979-0611 Public Program, How Aspects of God Are Expressed within Us, Caxton Hall, 10 Caxton Street, Westminster, London, UK</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> "Is a technique which is written in all the Scriptures.
