In the center is the seat of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, and on it Śhrī Brahmadeva creates the whole universe. He made this Bhavasāgara.<br /> After creating the Bhavasāgara, the question was, 'How to cross it over? The human being was created, but how to make him realize it? How to make human beings recognize it? In him, how to activate the Brahma Tattwa?' Meaning, 'How to get the Union of Śhiva and Śhakti within him? How would the connection be established?'<br /> <font color="red">For this, a special personality was created in this world. This was created by the combined essence of Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, and Maheśh, who we acknowledge as Śhrī Dattātreya. Śhrī Dattātreya is none other than Ādi Guru.<br /> He is My Guru. He has mentored Me all His past lives.<br /> If you hear about His birth and all His previous lives you would be amazed. We have forgotten such a great thing.<br /> Śhrī Dattātreya's Incarnations are numerous. Firstly He came as King Janaka. Śhrī Sītājī was His daughter, who was the embodiment of Śhakti Herself. Then He came as Macchindranāth, Zoroaster, and Muhammad Sāhab, who were a completely different type of human being.<br /> They trialed out lots of different things.<br /> Śhrī Datta, the Primordial Masters firstly in this world educated us about the symbolic forms within us. And then also said that, "You people got entangled in symbolism, in idol worshiping." Their meaning was to go beyond and recognize the Śhakti within these idols. That's why They talked about the idols.</font><br /> <font color="red">For example, there is a flower, and to describe the honey within the flower, They talked about the flower first, from which the people would taste the honey. But people got stuck to flower. So Then they took Incarnations and talked about the honey.<br /> In that, They talked about God in the abstract. They deliberately didn't talk about the reincarnation of life.</font><br /> Because as soon as you talk about past lives, people ask Me, "Mātājī, tell me about my past lives." The life that has passed, why do you want to know that? Whether you were a king or a pauper, what difference it will make?<br /> <font color="red">That's why They did not discuss past lives.<br /> Muhammad Sāhab was the same, Dattātreya's Incarnation, and the same Incarnation was King Janaka. The same Incarnation was Nāṇaka,</font> whose sister Nāṇakī, was the same Ādi Śhakti. She was Sītājī.<br /> ......<br /> I always say, "If a Muslim gets obstructed from getting his Realization, you take the name of Dattātreya." And if [a] Hindu gets obstructed, I say, 'You take Muhammad Sāhab's name.'

He was none other than the Incarnation of Śhrī Dattātreya.<br /> Thereafter, Macchindranāth, most have you must have heard His name, was also His Incarnation.<br /> After that Zoroaster who came three times on the Earth, He was also His Incarnation.<br /> After that Muhammad Sāhab, who was His Incarnation.<br /> And when He was asked that, "Bhāī [Brother] there must have been others also before you," then He replied, "Yes, there [was] a Muhammad." Then again He was asked who was before him. He replied, "There was one Muhammad."</font><br /> Muhammad means Praise, the One who is praised, the One who deserves to be praised and is the One who is Redeemer of the world.<br /> <font color="red">They were all Muhammads, they were all Dattātreyas, who came on Earth regularly.<br /> After that [was] Nāṇaka, Guru Nāṇaka. If you ever read His teachings, if you read His talks then you will be surprised that He has always talked in a Sahaja. He has said, "Sahaja Samādhi lago." He has said, "Kāhe re ban khojan jāe, Sarab nivāsī sadā alepā tohī saṃg[a] samāī, Puṣhpamadhya jo bāsa basata hai mukara māhī jaise chhāī, Taise hī harī base niraṃtara ghaṭa hī khojo bhāī."

He is just inside, achieve Him just inside. We are just singing poem, singing songs, we are just cramming His prescription."<br /> The talk of seeking this Absolute Principle, residing just inside the heart, has been made since ancient times by these Ādi Gurus, who are incarnated on this Earth again and again.</font><br /> ......<br /> <font color="red">After Nāṇak Sāhab, around fifty, sixty years ago in our Maharashtra Dattātreya incarnated as Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī.</font> If you want proof of it, then you get your Realization and after that if you put your hand on anyone, then you will get vibration of same kind: from just vibration only you can know about all.<br /> As you must have eyes to see any shape, its color, in the same way you are required to feel vibrations so that you may know all the gurus of the world and will be able to know as who is a true guru and who is a liar, who is equal to that Incarnation of Ādi Guru Dattātreya, for mere saying there are thousands of guru in modern times.

And people were getting vibrations from that side, so they said: "What are You doing your? Your Feet are towards Kaaba!" So He said, "All right, I'll turn My Feet's on the other side." And they started getting vibrations from the other side. They said, "What? Kaaba has moved or what?"<br /> He has, in a way, showed.<br /> 'But how dare They say many things?' When They said very few thing[s], they have killed all these people and tortured Them.<br /> If you read Muhammad Sāhab['s] life, you will feel, 'What foolish people we have been, the way we have tortured [Him]!'<br /> For fanaticism the way He was killed!<br /> Actually was poisoned. He had no place where to hide His head the way people were after Him, because He was telling the Truth.<br /> And fanaticism is one thing He fought.</font><br /> So, Guru Tattwa is killed as soon as you become a fanatic person.

It's a very funny relationship that exists because He is the father, He is the son, He is the brother, all the sublime relationships that can exist between a Guru and a disciple who is a Lady, who is a woman.<br /> Now, this Guru was created when the world was created itself. Because we ... one had to create a Guru before the world was created in then Vaikuṇṭha Stage only.</font><br /> But then He reincarnated many a times.<br /> At the time of Rāma, very early, even before Rāma came into this world, much earlier than that, He was created by Satī Anusūyā. She was Herself a part of the Ādi Śhakti, who created Him out of the essences, the innocence of Brahmā, Viṣhṇu and Maheśh.<br /> There's a legend about it which I will tell you sometime.<br /> And She created Him. Actually, She created Him, so She's the Mother.<br /> But then, She becomes the Guru.<br /> When She is born as Sītā, He becomes the father. So, She ... father is Her Guru.<br /> Then, when Rāja Janaka is born as Muhammad Sāhab, then She becomes again the daughter.<br /> But when He is born as Nāṇaka, then He becomes the ... She becomes His sister.<br /> So the relationship exists and whenever He is born, She is born, in a way, that, you see, that relationship is kept a sublime relationship. I mean to say: that they are never born as husband and wife."<br /> <font size="+0"><b>1977-0701 Guru Pūjā (Guru Pūrṇimā Day) (first more formal Pūjā in the West), Self-realization, Living Room, Gavin Brown's Geological Institute (Terrace House), 160 North Gower Street, 2nd Floor, Euston, London, UK</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">""</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1978-1014 Talk to Sahaja Yogis, Advice on Our Powers, How to Handle Scientists, First Western Seminar, Day 1, Conference Center, East Hampstead Park (near Workingham, 60 kms W of London), UK</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p>[<font color="orange">WARNING: Quotes after 1979-0108 to follow.</font>]</p><p> <font color="red">""</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b></b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> "For Cancer best treatment is of water i.e. putting feet in the river, sea or in the water at home with the photograph. <font color="red">Water has the religion (Dharma) of cleansing and hence Shri VISHNU and DATTATREYA responsible for the religion (Dharma) of human beings are to be worshiped.

If someone tries to pressurize us and says, 'You must ask for God,' then it is of no use, it is not an evaluation. That is why to reach in this state, a person has to seek the God as per his own independent sweet will and not due to any pressure, or any disease or any hardships or any sorrow, but only because of the fact and realizing that, 'It is the only motive of our life to seek God.'<br /> <font color="red">That is why, when we desire for this Divine Gift, then the doors of God Almighty's Divine Blessings open for you, and around the center is a place of Ten Primordial Gurus. These are the Main Gurus which are the Incarnation[s] of Śhri Dattātreya. They are: Socrates, Moses, Muhammad Sāhab, Guru Nāṇak, Śhirḍī Sāi Nāth, and Zoroaster. They are all Incarnation[s] of one Incarnation.</font>"<br /> There is no difference between Muhammad Sāhab and Guru Nāṇak. When Muhammad Sahab saw that people are taking wrong interpretation of His Dharma and doing everything against the dharma, then He was born again as Guru Nāṇak to correct it. Because He wanted to bring unity among people but you know what happened during Their lives.<br /> <font size="+0"><b>1979-0322 Public Program (Hindi), Sahaja Yoga and the Subtle System, Biralā Krīṛā Keṃdra, Chowpatty, Girgaum Chowpatty, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India (other date 0321)</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">""</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b></b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> <font color="red">"About Me also you can ask questions.
