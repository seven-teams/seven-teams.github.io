In the center is the seat of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, and on it Śhrī Brahmadeva creates the whole universe. He made this Bhavasāgara.<br /> After creating the Bhavasāgara, the question was, 'How to cross it over? The human being was created, but how to make him realize it? How to make human beings recognize it? In him, how to activate the Brahma Tattwa?' Meaning, 'How to get the Union of Śhiva and Śhakti within him? How would the connection be established?'<br /> <font color="red">For this, a special personality was created in this world. This was created by the combined essence of Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, and Maheśh, who we acknowledge as Śhrī Dattātreya. Śhrī Dattātreya is none other than Ādi Guru.<br /> He is My Guru. He has mentored Me all His past lives.<br /> If you hear about His birth and all His previous lives you would be amazed. We have forgotten such a great thing.<br /> Śhrī Dattātreya's Incarnations are numerous. Firstly He came as King Janaka. Śhrī Sītājī was His daughter, who was the embodiment of Śhakti Herself. Then He came as Macchindranāth, Zoroaster, and Muhammad Sāhab, who were a completely different type of human being.<br /> They trialed out lots of different things.<br /> Śhrī Datta, the Primordial Masters firstly in this world educated us about the symbolic forms within us. And then also said that, "You people got entangled in symbolism, in idol worshiping." Their meaning was to go beyond and recognize the Śhakti within these idols. That's why They talked about the idols.</font><br /> <font color="red">For example, there is a flower, and to describe the honey within the flower, They talked about the flower first, from which the people would taste the honey. But people got stuck to flower. So Then they took Incarnations and talked about the honey.<br /> In that, They talked about God in the abstract. They deliberately didn't talk about the reincarnation of life.</font><br /> Because as soon as you talk about past lives, people ask Me, "Mātājī, tell me about my past lives." The life that has passed, why do you want to know that? Whether you were a king or a pauper, what difference it will make?<br /> <font color="red">That's why They did not discuss past lives.<br /> Muhammad Sāhab was the same, Dattātreya's Incarnation, and the same Incarnation was King Janaka. The same Incarnation was Nāṇaka,</font> whose sister Nāṇakī, was the same Ādi Śhakti. She was Sītājī.<br /> ......<br /> I always say, "If a Muslim gets obstructed from getting his Realization, you take the name of Dattātreya." And if [a] Hindu gets obstructed, I say, 'You take Muhammad Sāhab's name.'

Then again He was asked who was before Him. He replied, "There was one Muhammad."</font><br /> Muhammad means Praise, the One who is praised, the One who deserves to be praised and is the One who is Redeemer of the world.<br /> <font color="red">They were all Muhammads, they were all Dattātreyas, who came on Earth regularly.<br /> After that [was] Nāṇaka, Guru Nāṇaka. If you ever read His teachings, if you read His talks then you will be surprised that He has always talked in a Sahaja. He has said, "Sahaja Samādhi lago." He has said, "Kāhe re ban khojan jāe, Sarab nivāsī sadā alepā tohī saṃg[a] samāī, Puṣhpamadhya jo bāsa basata hai mukara māhī jaise chhāī, Taise hī harī base niraṃtara ghaṭa hī khojo bhāī."

We are just singing poem, singing songs, we are just cramming His prescription.<br /> The talk of seeking this Absolute Principle, residing just inside the heart, has been made since ancient times by these Ādi Gurus, who are incarnated on this Earth again and again.</font><br /> ......<br /> <font color="red">After Nāṇak Sāhab, around fifty, sixty years ago in our Maharashtra Dattātreya incarnated as Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī.</font> If you want proof of it, then you get your Realization and after that if you put your hand on anyone, then you will get vibration of same kind: from just vibration only you can know about all.<br /> As you must have eyes to see any shape, its color, in the same way you are required to feel vibrations so that you may know all the Gurus of the world and will be able to know as who is a true guru and who is a liar, who is equal to that Incarnation of Ādi Guru Dattātreya, for mere saying there are thousands of guru in modern times.

Of course I don't know how many people have read about Nāṇak.<br /> Nāṇaka one day was sleeping, and His Feet were towards Kaaba. And people were getting vibrations from that side, so they said: "What are You doing your? Your Feet are towards Kaaba!" So He said, "All right, I'll turn My Feet's on the other side." And they started getting vibrations from the other side. They said, "What? Kaaba has moved or what?"<br /> He has, in a way, showed.<br /> 'But how dare They say many things?'

He had no place where to hide His head the way people were after Him, because He was telling the Truth.<br /> And fanaticism is one thing He fought.</font><br /> So, Guru Tattwa is killed as soon as you become a fanatic person.

She was an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti.<br /> The Primordial Master was also born as Macchindranāth, and again as Zoroaster who was worshiped by the ancient Persians, and still revered by Parsis. Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism. In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates. He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya).
