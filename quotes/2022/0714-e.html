All your acupuncture will just activate the sympathetic nervous system. If you try to handle your machinery without establishing the connection with the source of its power, the parasympathetic system, you will spoil it. When Lao Tze was alive, how many believed in Him and how many opposed Him? Why do you believe in Lao Tze? Because He is no more and you can handle Him instead of Him handling you. Once He is dead you are using Him and following dead rituals. Today, Lao Tze is dead and Mātājī is living.</font> So many people feel the Divine Breeze in their fingers.

This Tao is something like the Kuṇḍalinī of Sahaja Yoga. I have traveled through the Yangtze River. This voyage on a boat gave me a unique experience and enabled me to understand Lao Tze very well. This river is a very dangerous one in the beginning for boats to pass through. There are lots of currents which flow in different directions. But along the side of this river there are beautiful manifestations of nature. The very steep, rising mountains that we see in the paintings of the Chinese are all to be seen there with rivers flowing between them. It is very beautiful to see the bank of the Yangtze River. As Lao Tze had said: "It may be very beautiful and attractive outside, but you should keep your mind inside and ply through the Yangtze River". This is very significant, but how many understand what He has said? How many have tried to follow Him? In China many people do not seem to care much for Lao Tze and His Tao, but there will come a time when they will realize that that is the subtle side of humanity.</font>"<br /> <font size="+0"><b>1995-0929 Meta Modern Era, Chapter 8: World Peace</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p style="color:red;">Jay Śhrī Mātājī!<br /></p></section><footer class="page__meta"></footer><nav class="pagination"> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/quotes/2022/0714-i" class="pagination--pager" title="ŚHRĪ GURU NĀṆAKA in the Words of ŚHRĪ MĀTĀJĪ ">Previous</a> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/quotes/2022/0714-c" class="pagination--pager" title="ŚHRĪ MOSES in the Words of ŚHRĪ MĀTĀJĪ ">Next</a></nav></div></article></div><div class="page__footer"><footer><div class="page__footer-follow" style="width: max-content"><ul><li><strong>Follow:</strong></li><li><a href="/feed/festivity.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Festivity RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/compilation.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Compilations RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/quotes.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Quotes RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/scriptures.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Scriptures RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/chronology.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Chronology RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/yearly.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Yearly RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/feed/divine.xml"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Divine RSS Feed</a></li></ul></div><div class="page__footer-copyright"> Site content created by the Seven Teams. <br> Website powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" rel="nofollow">Jekyll</a> with <a href="https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io">AcademicPages</a> as a theme, modified by Sean Xiao, and a fork of <a href="https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/" rel="nofollow">Minimal Mistakes</a>.</div></footer></div><script src="https://seven-teams.github.io/assets/js/main.min.js"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', '', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script src="https://unpkg.com/vanilla-back-to-top@7.2.1/dist/vanilla-back-to-top.min.js"></script> <script>addBackToTop()</script></body></html>
