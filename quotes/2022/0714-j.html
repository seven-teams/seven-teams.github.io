They said He was not allowed to do them as He was a saṃnyāsī.<br /> So, likewise, such unauthorized people claiming to be higher above others have always insulted the Saints and made their lives miserable. Not only in India, but also elsewhere -- Prophet Muhammad was tortured by such people as well. He and His family were tortured so much more than Dñyāneśhwar, actually."<br /> <b>Version 2:</b><br /> "The people of Ahmednagar sent us an invitation with lot of affection, we are all very grateful for that.<br /> And furthermore, I feel Ahmednagar District to be very special.

They didn't talk much about giving Realization as such. They did not work too much on giving knowledge on Self-enlightenment to people.<br /> The one thing He said, that all of [Ten of] Them corroborate on, was not to consume alcohol.<br /> ......<br /> And such spurious people, they have always tormented the Saints. You know, how badly such people have caused misery to Dñyāneśhwara. <font color="red">Then, Sāī Nāth.</font> They have not spared anyone.<br /> Not only that, when Śhaṅkarāchārya, Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya went home when his mother died and He wanted to perform the final rituals, these people told him that, "You cannot perform as you are a saṃnyāsī." And nobody turned up for the final rituals. In Kālaṭi village He cut the tree and ignited the banana tree and performed the rituals. And He cursed entire Kerala that, "You would perform the final rituals in front of your homes and bury the dead body there." Even today same thing is happening.<br /> So, likewise, such unauthorized people have insulted all the Saints and monks. Not only in our country, but in most of the countries.<br /> Even during the times of Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon Him, the unauthorized people tortured and persecuted Him immensely.

All these Prophets belong to the category of the Gurus I am talking about.<br /> So, all over the world three types of movements were on. For example, the scientist[s] on the right-hand side, we can say, and the left-hand side are the devotees of God who sing the praise of God. And in the center there were people like Moses, like Abraham, who came on this earth just to prophesize, just to protect the devotees of God.<br /> Now this middle movement of evolution, today, has reached its peak. Because all the Incarnations have arrived now, and have done Their job within you. They have occupied Their position within you, in your awareness, on these different centers. <br /> ......<br /> So today we are here to know that within us all these Incarnations exist, and the force that really brought forth, really manifested, who live like human beings and work like Gurus, that force which existed in this area, which created religion within us.<br /> Religion, as we understand, organized religion, is not the religion. But the religion means: your sustaining power. You are a human being because there are ten sustaining powers within you.<br /> So, They came to sustain us and to give us full idea about these Ten Powers and to establish us in our religion as a human being.<br /> So these Gurus, who lived in that area, worked out the sustainace [sustenance] and helped us.<br /> And this is one of the greatest forces we have got, which resides within us.<br /> And whatever They have said has a very great meaning.<br /> Actually, we should say the Main Gurus are ten, but there are many other Gurus.<br /> <font color="red">And these Ten Gurus could be described as Rāja Janaka, then Moses, Abraham, and the in modern times you can say Muhammad Sāhab, and even up to Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth, in Śhirḍī, that force came in, for a short time, and then He disappeared. Nobody knows how He came there, He lived there and He died.</font> Also, if you know Nāṇaka, He was also the same force, the same Primordial Master, who was born on this Earth.<br /> Now, this is not the time to tell about individual people. But, I think, one day I will talk to you only on this subject of the Gurus.<br /> So, these Gurus first started under the Primordial Master Himself, He was called as Dattātreya. ......<br /> There's one more point I would like to tell you, that they have not yet gone here, but here [<font color="orange">unclear</font>], there are the two uh more small uh-uh-uh chakras: one that belongs to, uh uh which we call as the Sūrya -- Sūrya is the-uh-uh uh uh, means the Sun, the Sun center -- and the another as the Moon center on the left-hand side. And these two are uh governed or, we can say, is uh bestowed upon by two great uh-uh-uh people, who are the Disciple Elements.<br /> And They, disciple elements were first, were born to Śhrī Rāma and Śhrī Sītā as the-ee Lav and Kuśh. And then They incarnated many a times on this Earth as disciple. One of Them is, we can say, ah ... was uh Śhaṅkarāchārya, another was Kabīra, uh like that. Then, we can say, later on, uh like, uh before Śhaṅkarāchārya, they came as Buddha and Mahāvīra. Then Śhaṅkarāchārya, and then, uh I told you, which is? Uh after Śhaṅkarāchārya came ... the Advent of Hasan and Husayn, who were the grandsons of Prophet.<br /> So these have been incarnating, and they have been moving from one uh-uh-uh side to another and telling people that, "This is extreme, leave it." "This is the extreme, leave it. Come in the center, and be in the center." That has been Their job. And they are the ones who are, sort of, imparting you that awareness by you become a perfect disciple.<br /> And the ... this is a very important point because it comes, quite often, that uh-uh-uh we do not understand.<br /> Like Prophet Muhammad said that: "I am the last Prophet." All right, He did say He was the last Prophet.<br /> Supposing I say, I am the last person to come here. All right I would say just to frighten you that, 'h-oh, you better take to it otherwise this is the last time I am telling you!' [Laughs.]<br /> But it is never that!<br /> Because when He wa... died He found out: that, you see, these people are madcaps. 'I didn't tell them this, what are they doing out of Me?' So, He said, 'I better go back again.'<br /> And He came as Nāṇaka. And He told them, that: "Hindu and Muslims are same people, following the same religion, why are you fighting among yourselves?" See, They came for that unity.<br /> Then as Nāṇaka He came. So, in Nāṇaka's system also the Sikhism came in and they started a warrior class and this and that. I mean imagine, the Sikhism ended up by having wars within Muslims and Hindus.<br /> <font color="red">So, then He came as Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth to teach them.</font><br /> Now, this is not a very important thing that, say Muhammad Sāhab said, "I am the last." Say He is the last, all right, even take that position. Who are you to Him? How are you related? Through what? What is your authority? How do you appropriate Him to yourself? Because you say you are Muslims, so what? How did you become Muslims?

All animals from snakes and scorpions to elephants, horses and lions are residing in him.

Will you connect in its place a plug which is out of order? It is quite pragmatic.<br /> I cannot understand what hallucination is there on human intellect, that he does not accept the Truth which he is seeing but accepts something that is not seen? Its reason was understood long back and that is ahaṅkār [ego]. Man has too much of ego.<br /> If you had accepted Śhrī Rāma in His days, He would have told you to get your Kuṇḍalinī awakened and get the Realization and get established in Sahaja Yoga.<br /> Had you recognized Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, He would not have played Sahaja Yoga in Gokul, but would have given you the Realization and told you to practice Sahaja Yoga.<br /> If Śhrī Nāṇak had been accepted, there was no need for Him to break His head telling you to do different things. He would have simply taught Sahaja Yoga, but very few understood Him in His days.<br /> Now, when He is not here, you have built gurudwārās in His name.<br /> When Muhammad is not here mosques have been made, because they think now Muhammad Sāhib is in their hands.<br /> Now Rāma is in their hands, and they can make His temple and say, 'His is our temple, this Rāma is our property. We have authority over Him and whatever you have brought, all money and other things, offer them to this idol.'<br /> You say all this because you think you are the authority of this idol.
