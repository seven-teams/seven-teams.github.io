You become guṇātīt, dharmātīt. You go on the other side of it.<br /> The road to attain that religion is that of the raising of the Kuṇḍalinī. Now you have to give up the false ideas that, 'We have to pay money,' 'It is too difficult,' 'It causes a lot of trouble,' etc. You have to explain this fact properly to the people.<br /> If you just take the example of Tukārām, you see in how many ways he has described this.<br /> In Amṛutānubhav, Gyāneśhwara has described these things so beautifully.<br /> If you read the śhlokas of Nāmadeva, you will be surprised that how he has described such great things with the simplest of words.</font><br /> <b>1986-1229 Public Program (Marathi), Art, Commerce, and Science, Rahimatpur (22 kms SE of Sātārā), Maharashtra, India</b><br /> <br /> <font color="red">Dyaneśhwa Himself has clearly written in His book Amṛutānubhav that after reading His book, one should simply contemplate and think, 'What this is all about?', not merely continue reading. You will be surprised that He has stipulated in it more clearly what I am emphasizing.</font><br /> <b>1986-1231 Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī Pūjā (Marathi + English), Sangli, Maharashtra, India</b><br /> <br /> <font color="red">After that, in the twelfth century we had a great poet in Maharashtra. His name was Gyāneśhwara. He also explained distinctly about Kuṇḍalinī in the sixth chapter of Gyāneśhwarī.<br /> Apart from this, He has written a very beautiful book called Amṛutānubhav. This book is so unprecedented that I think I haven't seen such a profound book written on spirituality better than this.</font><br /> <b>1989-0316 Public Program (Hindi), Kuṇḍalinī Ke Jāgran Ke Bād Lābh (Benefits after Awakening of Kuṇḍalinī) or The Power of Love and the Blessings of Kuṇḍalinī, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India</b><br /> <br /> <font color="red"></font><br /> <b>1990-1217 Śhrī Chakra and Śhrī Lalitā Chakra Pūjā (English + Marathi), Brahmapuri (near Sātārā), Maharashtra, India</b><br /> <br /> <font color="red"></font><br /> <b>1991-0427 Public Program, Theater-in-the-Park, Flushing Meadow Park, Queens, New York City, NY, U.S.A.</b><br /> <br /> <font color="red"></font><br /> <b>1991-1207 Public Program, Day 2, Geetha Bhawan, 133 Lloyds Road, Ganapathy Colony, Gopalapuram, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India</b><br /> <br /> <font color="red">Gyāneśhwarjī was tortured so much. In His sixth chapter He mentioned about Gītā, and He also mentioned that Self-realization can be attained only by the awakening of the Kuṇḍalinī. And every one was behind Him, torturing Him so much that, at the age of twenty-three, He wrote such a wonderful book called Amṛutānubhav, which you should read only after Self-realization, and it will make you feel that you are in Heaven. He was tortured so much that He had to take Samādhi, a state of intense and permanent trance.</font><br /> <b>1991-1211 Public Program (Hindi), Day 2, Hyderabad, Telangana, India</b><br /> <br /> <b> Variant 1:</b><br /> <font color="red">In our Maharashtra there was a Great Incarnation, Gyāneśhwarajī.

College, Pune, Maharashtra, India</b><br /> <br /> <b> Variant 1:</b><br /> <font color="red">However, I had inner desire to tell here, about Śhrī Kārttikeya to you since He was born in Maharashtra. Also He came as Śhrī Gyāneśhwara. I have not so far told about it because the people from Maharashtra fail to understand certain things. Śhrī Kārttikeya Himself took birth in Maharashtra and wrote two beautiful treatises, the Gyāneśhwarī and the Amṛutānubhav.<br /> If you see them with the vibrations you will search yourself in the ocean, in the waves of joy.<br /> I have not told such a big thing earlier, because of the Maharashtra peoples' attitude. The reason for this is, perhaps, we had terrible politicians in the past and probably their terrible behavior and ill temperament have spread in Maharashtra. And Śhrī Kārttikeya belonged to Maharashtra. A simple Maharashtrian mind can understand it. But also, there are oversmart people.<br /> ......<br /> Lethargy, irritability, irascibility, coming out with something new, and such other behavior are not acceptable in Sahaja Yoga. One should have peaceful temperament. Śhrī Gyāneśhwara has beautifully explained it in His book, the Amṛutānubhava. But, where are the people who can understand it? They cannot grasp it.<br /> So, buy a copy of this book. You should not mechanically repeatedly read it, try to understand it. Read every word. They describe this state of a Sahaja Yogi, satisfied within himself and enjoying. He does not want power, money, nothing. He is so blissful. He has personality which is special.</font><br /> <b> Variant 2:</b><br /> <font color="red">But I had an immense desire to tell you all about Śhrī Kārttikeya because He took birth in this Maharashtra, He was Śhrī Gyāneśhwara Himself. I have not said anything about this until now because Maharashtrians find it difficult to understand it. Śhrī Kārttikeya Himself took birth in this Maharashtra and He wrote such great and deep scriptures like Gyāneśhwarī and Amṛutānubhava.<br /> You can ask a question by putting your attention to see if Śhrī Gyāneśhwara was an Incarnation of Śhrī Kārttikeya, and you will find yourself in an ocean of beautiful, joyful Cool Breeze.<br /> I never told such a big thing like this in Maharashtra, because of the change in nature of Maharashtrian people now. Maybe because of all the horrible politicians we had here, and it might have influenced the Maharashtrians. And Śhrī Kārttikeya means, being in here, quite simple Maharashtrians can understand it. But also, there are oversmart people.<br /> ......<br /> Take the example of Amṛutānubhava, how amazing it is. How Gyāneśhwara has explained it to people, but where are those people now, who would understand it? They do not understand what He has written. So take to Amṛutānubhava, don't go on reading Scriptures in a ritualistic way. Read every word from it to see if you are anywhere at that level.<br /> A Sahaja Yogi who is completely satisfied, and joyful, becomes one with himself, he does not want any power or money, he has reached that level. He becomes the joy himself, he has a very special kind of personality.<br /> .....<br /> I wish you all could read Amṛutānubhava in English, understanding how He describes a realized Soul, and you'll find that within yourself it has happened. You are different from others very much. You'll be amazed how you have got such beautiful description of yourself.</font><br /> <b>1996-1221 Śhrī Kārttikeya Pūjā (Marathi + English), Śhrī Gyāneśhwara, Park (200 m from ISYRH Center), C.B.D. Belapur, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India</b><br /> <br /> <font color="red">...... I felt that Kārttikeya was born as Gyāneśhwara.<br /> That's why at the age of twenty-three He took a Samādhi. But He wrote this ... uh ... beautiful thing, Gyāneśhwarī and another one He has written Amṛutānubhav. So all should read that English book, is wonderful book.
