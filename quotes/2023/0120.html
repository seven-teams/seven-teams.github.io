And They suffered a lot. And He asked Nivṛuttināth for one permission: that, "Let Me open the Truth to the public. Just I'll tell about it! I'll not do anything, I'll just tell about it."</font><br /> Because thirteen, fourteen thousand years back Mārkaṇḍeya has described about Kuṇḍalinī. Then came ... Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya has described about Kuṇḍalinī.<br /> But all in Sanskrit language. And Sanskrital knowledge was not available to the common public.

We must write about it!" So He allowed.</font><br /> And He wrote it in the sixth chapter of that Gyāneśhwarī.<br /> But people said ... the people who were in charge of the religion, that time, said: "This chapter is something to be condemned." Because they didn't know how to awaken the Kuṇḍalinī. "This has to be absolutely condemned, and nobody should read this one." Niṣhiddha is the word, is not so bad as it's condemned, but niṣhiddha: is not to be read.<br /> Thus, all this knowledge, of the inner be-ing, was kept in the darkness.
