The aim of every religion was to establish balance in every way to make way for the ascent of the seeker. <font color="red">The Second Birth, Walīhood, Selfhood, Buddha's State, Jaini State, Gnostic, or Ātma-sākṣhātkār, are all names for Self-realization.</font> It was all right in the olden days, where people wanted to be good and to ascend. They obeyed and tried to do whatever was asked for by the Saints, Prophets or Incarnations.<br /> ......<br /> On the whole, if you see, Western culture denies Christ who sacrificed his life for the sins of the people. Those who call themselves Christians indulge in all kinds of activities which are anti-Christ. When Christ came into this world in the Realm of Divinity, one had to go through penance (tapasyā). <font color="red">Buddha and Mahāvīra had to do the same at that time.</font> Christians do not know what is penance and they cannot sacrifice even a pin for others. They are very good at lip service. Big conferences are held in the developing nations for monetary help, who pay for these conferences and the outcome is that nothing can be done for the poor countries while Westerners spend their superfluous money on all kinds of waste.<br /> ......<br /> Now, a few words about Buddhism. <font color="red">Lord Buddha talked about compassion, compassion and compassion. He bore all the troubles of those days and at the end of his life he was in a very bad financial condition and ultimately he died in a very remote corner of India. Lord Buddha's life has been really ideal but people believe that you cannot attain spiritual ascent unless and until you suffer like Him and give up everything the way He had given it up.</font> The ascetic concept is that one has to give up the family, one has to give up money, property, all possessions, one has to give up the normal life that one leads and has to be an absolute celibate in order to move on the spiritual path. But there are Buddhists and Buddhists. Most of their different forms are lost in ritualism or mental meditation. The Japanese follow the Zen system without understanding anything about it. <font color="red">They have built a beautiful temple of Buddha in Bodhi Gayā where Buddha got his Nirvāṇa.</font> When Genghis Khān invaded Behar, the Buddhist monks did not resort to violence and died. Another style of Buddhism is that of the Japanese who had to learn a lesson through the extreme suffering of Hiroshima.<br /> The Dalai Lamas preach nonviolence, but they have been very money or gold-oriented people. In Beijing, one can see thousands of gold plates and gold beer mugs with Pali inscriptions in the secret vaults. It is said they were rescued from a river by the Chinese soldiers who went after Mister [Dalai] Lama and his followers who were running away to India and who dumped part of the gold they were carrying in the river. This was rescued and put in the museum. They wear saffron clothes to show that they are saṃnyāsīs but live like lords in Dharmaśhālā. I met such a Canadian saṃnyāsī in Canada and he told me that he had no other clothes but these. He said he lost all his property to Dalai Lama who begs all over the world. In Dharmaśhālā, there was a great protest against these very aggressive Dalai Lama's people, but many Governments have sympathy for this money-oriented (gold-oriented), spiritual head, so to pacify these ignorant Governments, who do not discriminate between truth and hypocrisy, the protesters had to ask for forgiveness.<br /> As it is, India has a large load of refugees and they cannot afford to have these gold-oriented saṃnyāsīs which have created a diplomatic rift between China and India. There are Buddhists in Nepal who believe in black magic. Many seekers go to Nepal and get lost. Buddhist Lamas are of many kinds. Some of them have monasteries where to raise the Kuṇḍalinī the seekers are beaten on the spinal cord till their backs are broken. In China they also worship Mother Mercy, Kuan Yin [Guānyīn], who was a Chinese Incarnation. <font color="red">Lord Buddha has given three mantras to chant: to surrender to Lord Buddha or a realized Soul; surrender to dharma (morality); surrender to collectivity.</font> They use a noisy wail to chant mantras. <font color="red">Like all other religious Incarnations he has talked of "Maitreya", is a future Buddha who will give liberation.
