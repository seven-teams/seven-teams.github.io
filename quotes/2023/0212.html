So, She ... She resides as a pure relationship of these Gurus.<br /> Thus, the Mahālakṣhmī's greatest ... greatness is that: through Her Power only the Suṣhumṇā is covered by Kuṇḍalinī. She is the power of our evolution. And by Her Power only, we have risen to be human beings, and by Her Son's Power, we are going to become higher people.<br /> Thus the importance of Mahālakṣhmī is very great for all the Sahaja Yogis. Because She guides our Viṣhṇu Tattwa to its culmination, to its completion, which is the Principle of our Evolution. Thus She is a Giver of Dharma, She gives us the dharma, and She is the Giver of the Truth. She's the One who relates us to our brain. The whole brain's system is Mahālakṣhmī's system. So, it is She who exposes the whole of the knowledge as truth to us, on our central nervous system.<br /> But at the State of Virāṭa, when Śhrī Kṛiṣh... uh ... when Viṣhṇu becomes the Virāṭa, the Great Primordial Being, then She is called as Virāṭaṅganā, as His Power.<br /> So these are the Incarnations, of Mahālakṣhmī, about which I have told you."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1984-0908 Śhrī Mary Mahālakṣhmī Pūjā, Münich, Germany</b></font></p><div class="para-divider"></div><p> "In no Incarnation a male has come without a female.

Now if we see from the beginning with all the Ādi Gurus, She was born to them as a daughter or as a sister. Like the daughter of Janaka was Śhrī Sītā: She was the form of Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī, was the Principle of Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī. Sītā was Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī, and She was the daughter of Janaka. Then the sister of Śhrī Nāṇaka, Nāṇakī, She was Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī. Her relation was of sister. In the same way, the daughter of Muhammad Sāhib, Fāṭimah, She was Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī. After Her, Rādhā: Rādhā was the form of Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī. After Her, Mary: Mary was Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī, and Her relation was of purity. She was so pure that with Her purity She gave birth to Śhrī Christ. So She was a form of complete pure Virgin. And as She was a form of Virgin, because of Her purity She got a Son pure as Christ.
