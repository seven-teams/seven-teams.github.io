<font size="+2"><b>Sincerity Itself Is Rewarding</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Now, today is the day to make a big determination that you will start enjoying your Collective Spirit. Everything for the collectivity. Then the enjoyment will be maximum. You will never feel that you have sacrificed anything.<br />
......<br />
So, you must make a determination not to lea... bring Sahaja Yoga to your personal level, or to your limited problems, or to your own relationships. It is the relationship of the Creation with God. Is not your relationship of anybody else's relationship. As in any machine, all the wires must be connected to the mains through one main wire, in the same way you all must be connected to God individually so that you all are connected among yourself. I've been saying this again and again and again because, at Sahasrāra, you are being blessed of this Collective Spirit.<br />
The second very important point is of complete integration within and without.<br />
......<br />
And it comes: first of all is sincerity. First of all is complete sincerity.
......<br />
So you try to feel it from your heart: that's what it means sincerity. Do not depend on anyone: your wife, husband, children, nothing, mother, father. It's your own!<br />
So, you have to work in such a way that you get complete integration. And the driving force towards integration is a very simple one: is sincerity. Thus, you will know that automatically you are getting integrated.<br />
......<br />
And then sincerity itself is rewarding. This principle must be written down in your hearts: that sincerity itself is rewarding. You don't have to go to anybody else to ask first the reward of sincerity, sincerity itself rewards you. And that's why you start enjoying your own sincerity.<br />
......<br />
Try to become sincere and sincere and sincere and enjoy your sincerity.<br />
I bless you all with your sincerity.<br />"<br />

<font size="+2"><b>Greatest Weapon Of All</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"And in the Vaikuṇṭha Stage it is described very clearly how Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa Himself came to bless Him and told Him, that, "You will be placed even higher than Me, because Your body will be made out of Chaitanya."<br />
Chaitanya, what is the English word for Chaitanya?<br /> 
......<br />
Divine Awareness! Of the Divine Awareness. You can say is the Divine Awareness Itself, is the Divine Vibrations are shown in us.<br />
In the same way, He's made out of that like the ... like Śhrī Gaṇeśha is.<br />
Now if He's so or not, because most of you are Indians here, you might challenge it. You may. I can prove it to you. Because is the same Swastika. The āyudhas or the weapons of Śhrī Gaṇeśha have become avyakta, are not expressed. Because He used one weapon for all of them: is of forgiveness.<br />
And that is the Greatest Weapon of all, and that's why, at this stage when the Kuṇḍalinī goes, you have to take His name or you have to forgive people.<br />
Forgiveness is the Greatest Weapon that God has given us.<br />
Now it is for you to verify whether I say it is correct or not.<br />
But crucifixion is not the Message.<br />
Crucifixion is the explanation of what Kṛiṣhṇa preached, that the Chaitanya, the Divine Awareness, does not vanish, does not. It is akṣhara, it does not get killed. You cannot control it. And this was to be proved in His life through His Resurrection.<br />
The Resurrection is the Message of Christ.<br />
But as in India, you have done all the mess of all these Incarnations, they have done the mess of Christ, in two ways.<br />
One, by not respecting the celibacy of life. He was a celibate person. He was a holy person! Of course He respected the marriage institution because He attended the marriage. You have crucified Him again.<br />
And secondly, which is His Power of Forgiveness, Complete Power of Forgiveness.<br />
But they had empires! They now want to have e-conomic, what you call the economic controlling power, and all kinds of these things they are doing under the name of political, I don't know what they call it.<br />
They have to be Christians.<br />
All that was against Him is done now today, as the Indians have done all that what was against Hinduism."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>Nothing But Love And Compassion And The Message Of Breaking The Sahasrāra</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"The Resurrection of Christ is very symbolic for Sahaja Yoga. If Christ could be resurrected, then the human beings also can be resurrected, because He came as a human being with all powers and He created the Path of Resurrection for us. This Path of Resurrection is the one that we have followed in Sahaja Yoga.<br />
......<br />
What does a human being need is nothing but love and compassion: love and compassion of a very, very pure type.<br />
Look at Christ: He pitied the people who crucified Him. He told His Father, the God Almighty, that, "Please forgive them, because they don't know what they are doing." He could see that the blindness of these people are doing wrong things and God the Father will be very annoyed, who is wrathful, and may destroy them. So, this is what uh it was done with a very compassionate feeling. Without thinking about, just automatically, He felt that, 'These people are doing all this to Me and I don't know what will happen to them.' So, He prayed to God, to Father: "Please forgive. Please forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing, they are blind. So please do not punish them."<br />
What compassion! What love! I mean, think of it: kuh do we do that in our life if somebody harms us, troubles us? Do we ask Father to forgive those who do not know what they are doing? That should be the level of Sahaj Yog. And it will work out very well if you ask for forgiveness, God will look after them, He'll transform them, He'll bring them to their senses.<br />
......<br />
Is the Christ within you has to arise, Christ within you has to guide, it is Christ within you who will teach you how to behave towards others and how to gain their confidence, and give them the love and peace, that you have now flowing within you, to make them very, very happy and joyous people. This is the Message of Resurrection, this is the Message of breaking the Sahasrāra."<br />

But if you are still moving with your egos, and if you are still thinking on those lines, that: 'We are something and the we can start our own Sahaj Yog. We can work out this way and that way,' or, 'My wife is like that,' 'My child is like that,' 'My husband is like that.'<br />

My attention is always on your Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
You cannot play tricks in Sahaja Yoga, take it from Me. Anybody who tries to play any trick will be very badly punished. So please be very, very careful not to be dishonest, and not to play tricks in Sahaja Yoga. <br />

<font size="+2"><b>We Have Started The Great Religion</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Of course, the bhakti does give that purity, but if there is anything lingering in your mind, I have to tell you that there are three things that are going to happen from today.<br />
First, we have started Vishwa Nirmala Dharma. You are under the vision of Śhrī Gaṇeśh, under the guidance of your Spirit, and under the blessings of God Almighty. But be careful, because once you become that, you have to keep to that Dharma, you have to be honest about it. If you are dishonest from today onwards, you be careful, anything can happen to you if you get out of the maryādās. Till you keep to the Maryādās of Sahaja Yoga, saying morning, evening, night that, 'I am a Sahaja Yogi,' nobody can har ... hurt, nobody can trouble you. On the contrary you will be enjoying life if you keep to the maryādās. But if you leave the Maryādās of Sahaja Yoga, you will have big problems.<br />
So this is the second thing I want to tell you: that today we have started the Great Religion, which was promised long time back, of realized Souls.<br />
Now the third thing is that with all these things we are doing, we must promise to God also that, 'We will know about Sahaja Yoga through proper understanding, reading every word of it, we'll master the knowledge of Sahaj Yog, we'll keep ourselves clean, and completely surrender our lives to Sahaja Yoga.' This is what you have to promise in your heart. Surrendering to Sahaja Yoga is actually surrendering to joy, bliss and peace. In that you are the gainer, nobody is a loser in it. This is how today we have to decide once for all."<br />

"Firstly, you must see for yourself what is Sahaja Yoga, what it has given you. It has given you Realization, it has given you that wider vision, it has given you Collective Consciousness, it has given you thoughtless awareness and doubtless awareness. It has made a new personality out of you, like an egg becoming a bird.<br />
......<br />
But the best part of it: that I don't need Sahaj Yog, and that Sahaja Yoga does not need you. You need Sahaja Yoga.<br />
In itself, Sahaja Yoga is complete. It does not need you. It is a complete thing, will remain like that, absolutely. It will have its own position, its own status, its own dignity, everything intact.<br />
But if you have to get something out of it, you have to work it out."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>The Greatest Event Of All The Spiritual Happenings Of The Universe</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Today, it's a great day for all of us, the seekers, that the last work of the Divine, of opening the last center in the Great Primordial Being, was done on the fifth of May nineteen seventy [1970].<br />
It is the greatest event of all the spiritual happenings of the Universe. It was done with very great care and great adjustments.<br />
It is not in the limits of human understanding, how things are worked in the Heavens.<br />
......<br />
Without this happening, there could not have been a possibility to give [en] masse Realization to people. One could have done it for one or two persons here and there, but to give such a [en] masse awakening could not have been possible.<br />
As you know, in the Sahasrāra there are the Seats of the seven main chakras. There are one thousand nāḍīs or, as they call it, flames, and they all have each Sixteen Thousand Powers. Every nāḍī deals with a particular type of a person, and, with the permutations and combinations of all these nāḍīs, human beings are looked after.<br />
As soon as Sahasrāra was opened, the whole atmosphere was filled with tremendous Chaitanya. And there was tremendous light in the sky. And the whole thing came on this Earth, as if a torrential rain, or a waterfall, with such a tremendous force, as if I was unaware, and got stupefied. The happening was so unexpected and so tremendous that I was stunned, and I became completely silent at its-ss grandeur. I saw the Primordial Kuṇḍalinī rising like a ... like a big furnace. And the furnace was very silent, but burning uh-uh-uh appearance it had. As if you heat up some metal, and it has many colors, in the same way, the Kuṇḍalinī showed up like a huge furnace, say of a, I can say, uh of a furnace which is like a tunnel, uh-uh-uh where you see these uh ... plants uh you have for a coal uh-uh-uh burning ... to create electricity. And it stretched, like a telescope, one after another, it came out: tchue, tchue, tchue, like that. And the Deities-s came and sat on Their Seats, on Their Golden Seats, and then They lifted the whole of the head, like a big dome, and opened it. And then this torrential rain completely drenched Me. And I started seeing all that, and got lost into the Joy. Is like an artist seeing its own creation fulfilled, I felt the joy of great fulfillment.<br />
After coming out of that beautiful experience, I looked around and I saw human beings so blind, and I became absolutely silent.<br />
Then I desired that I should get the cups to fill this Nectar, but I saw all stones."<br />

"How there are ... there is no alternative for Sahaj Yog, no alternative, one must know. Everything that is living has no alternatives.<br />
......<br />
Count your blessings one by one. Count your blessings one by one, I'll say again, count your blessings one by one.<br />

But in wise projection we can see that you are what you have to be. You are Saints. You were born to be Saints in this great country. You are specially blessed people in the Heavens, and [you] are sent on this Earth to do this Mahā Yoga, to spread it. You have achieved that state. And if you are Saints, you should not be bothered as to few things like uh, 'Oh! I haven't got a suit,' or somethings like that, which you have never felt very nice on this.<br />
......<br />
Look at the little ones: how they came forward to give Me flowers, every step, every movement was so joyous, was creating such a beautiful delicate ripple in My heart. And it's written as history for Me to see these little, little sweet, innocent Gaṇeśhas coming forward.<br />
That in wisdom becomes so [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] that you know the Source of Love as Gaṇeśha [<font color="orange">unclear</font>]. For He did not know anything else but one that which is the Source of Love. Never questioned. Never argued, no alternative. No new ideas came into head, He's just steadying in."<br />

<p>
"I have to tell ... I'll have to tell you the story about the Sahasrāra Day, about which it was decided, long time back, before I incarnated. They had a big meeting in the Heavens, all the thirty-five karoṛs [350 millions] of Gods, the Deities, were there present to decide what is to be done. 'This is the ultimate that we have to do to human beings: is to open their Sahasrāra, to open their awareness to the Spirit, to the Real Knowledge of the Divine, to remove the darkness of ignorance.' And it had to be spontaneously because it has to work the living force of God. Also it had to be very quick. So all the Gods requested that now, I, the Ādi Śhakti, has to take the birth.<br />
......<br />
It had to be before the sixth of May, because sixth of May was the Doomsday in that year. So it was done on the fifth of May at the nick of the time. It was all decided beforehand. And every Deity's job was allotted to all of Them, very efficient Deities, very obedient. They knew Me very well, completely dedicated and devoted, they knew Me eve... very, very well, every end of My hair they knew. I didn't have to teach Them protocol.<br />
Love itself gives you protocol.<br />
......<br />
What a tremendous task it was!<br />
So, I said, at Sahasrāra I had to be Mahāmāyā. I had to be Mahāmāyā. I had to be something that people cannot recognize Me easily. But Deities? No. This Māyā ... Mahāmāyā had to come on this Earth, not the Ādi Śhakti in Her purest form, is too much. So, She was covered with this Mahāmāyā.<br /> 
......<br />
And is already predicted that the whole world will come down at the Lotus Feet of your Mother and that you will decide the future of this world. Is written, already, fourteen thousand years back, and there's another one who is prophesizing the same."<br />
