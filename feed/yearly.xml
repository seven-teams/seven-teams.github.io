<font size="+2"><b></b>Treat Each Other As Brothers And Sisters<br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Like uh-uh... people start choosing their life partners in Sahaj Yog. That is not allowed. That is not allowed. You are not to spoil your Āśhrams, your centers, using them for a marriage uh-uh searching society. You must respect it! This point you must respect. If you have to marry, then you can find your life partner outside Sahaja Yoga, to begin with. But if you want to marry in Sahaja Yoga, then you should not go on searching people in Sahaj Yog. Is a very dangerous thing for Sahaj Yog itself and for you people. That is one thing one should never try to do with Sahaja Yogis.<br />
For all practical pur... purposes you are brothers and sisters. And that's why I always encourage marriages between people who belong to another country or ano... another centers.<br />
......<br />
It's very wrong to do such a thing as to arrange your marriage with a Sahaja Yogi by yourself. It will be dangerous. I don't want to say anything, but it won't turn out to be good because it is anti-God activity, absolutely anti-God.<br />
You are supposed to develop your brahmacharya, you are supposed to develop your Mūlādhāra. Instead of that, if you start using a Sahaja Yoginī or a Sahaja Yogi for the selection of your married life, it's going to be very, very troublesome: your Mūlādhāra will not settle down. I mean that's a very bad stroke for your development.<br />
......<br />
For your own sake, for your own pleasures, you should not spoil the name of Sahaja Yoga.<br />
That is one thing I have seen, so I would say that today, as it is the day of purity between relationship, let us know that you have to treat each o... each other as brothers and sisters.<br />
No such play should be followed. Don't allow your mind to drift into this. Because if you allow, then there's no end to it. As it is, you know it is how hard it is to bring you back to normalcy.<br />
......<br />
So the maryādās are to be established first with Me, that understand that you should not try to trouble Me, at all, like this.<br />
Secondly, you must try to please Me by being good people.<br />
I hear that uh somebody is trying to be very egoistical. He doesn't even put on My tapes, he just gives his own lectures. This kind of a thing is very surprising! How can people do like that?"<br />

<font size="+2"><b>I Bless You That You All Become Gurus</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Today is a very great day for all the Sahaja Yogi[s]. Because Sahasrāra opened in you, you could feel the existence of God. ...... This's a very big opening all over the world. Today I say that's why is one of the greatest day for you.<br />
......<br />
But now I have to say that quite a lot of you can become gurus, means teachers, and you should act as teachers.<br />
To act as teacher you should know Sahaja Yoga, the theory and the practice of it, thoroughly well and then you can become a guru. It's a very responsibility, lot of understanding for a guru.<br />
......<br /> 
So you have to be a perfect Sahaja Yogi, thenly [then only] you can be a guru. And so many of you can be, but you have to ascertain first: `Are you capable of being your guru or not?'<br />
......<br />
You have to do now My work. I won't be able to go all over, but you have to go to other countries and create new Sahaja Yogis. You can do it.<br />
......<br />
So, I'm telling you that you have to take over and work it out. That doesn't mean you cancel Me [some laughter], no, not at all. I am there with you and every place you work you put My Photograph, but Realization you have to give and try to give mass Realization. If that doesn't work out, then you should know you are not a guru. If you can give mass Realization, then only you are a guru. Otherwise you are not. I said you can use My Photograph but you have to give Realization to people. This is the sign of a guru.<br />
......<br />
This is a big power you have got, you all should use. First of all you can use a group if you want, and afterwards you should do it individually. Can you imagine all of you, if you become gurus, how many Sahaja Yogis we'll have all over the world‽<br />
......<br />
This is you[r] responsibility. This is how Sahaja Yoga will grow. Otherwise, after I'll retire or I'll don't go anywhere, then Sahaja Yoga will go into waste. So it is for you to carry the torch, the light. It's your responsibility now. You have got your Realization.<br />
......<br />
This is the day of Guru Pūrṇimā and I bless you that you all become gurus.<br />
......<br />
 It is not My old age but I want to give you a complete freedom to spread Sahaja Yoga. You have got with free and you also have to give it to people free -- not to charge there.<br />
......<br />
You have to save the world. All My work is that."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>All Viṣhṇu Principles Are Now Awakened Within You</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"It is such a great day today, that the French call ... got their liberation, [laughing:] and this day. [The French National Day, 1789-0714, is the anniversary of the Storming of the Bastille.]<br />
So, the liberation through anger, when it comes, hatred is the basis of these revolutions and these, so-called, achieved liberations.<br />
If the liberation takes place within yourself, so that you are no more [a] slave of any one of these horrible destructive forces and negative forces, then it's a real liberation.<br />
The second thing that has happened in France, first time in Europe, it has been recognized as dharma. It's a very big thing, and give a hand to it. [Applause.] It is recognized that Sahaja Yoga is Dharma. [Laughs.] It is! But today it was recognized. This is a very big thing.<br />
......<br />
But today, as Sahaja Yoga is established is dharma, we have to know about Śhrī Viṣhṇu, who is the Basis of Dharma.<br />
......<br />
So now, where is the dharma? Dharma is within. And that is why this Viṣhṇu Principle is to be awakened within yourself.<br /> 
And this Principle then expands into many ways. Because Viṣhṇu is the One who is ... the One who cures. We call Him a Dhanvantari, means a doctor. He is the One who cures. Because: He is our preserver. He is the preserver of human beings. So if you preserve your dharma, then you don't get sick. And if you get sick, it is Viṣhṇu who will preserve, who will cure you. So, He is the One who is ah-ah ... we can call Dhanvantari: is a doctor.<br />
......<br />
This is the dharma, which you have accepted. I never told you anything, but you have accepted. And you have imbibed, and you are enjoying it.<br />
Now if they accept us as dharma, what is so special? We are the only dharma.<br />
The rest are all adharmīs. They call themselves dhārmik, [but] they have no dharma in them.<br />
Unless and until you have dharm by which you get a balance, wisdom, you cannot ascend.<br />
But if you ascend even without dharma, Sahaja Yoga is so great, I've seen, people who were quiet adhārmik and all that [snaping the right fingers:] just got Realization. If you ascend, then dharma trickles down: they become dhārmik.<br />
......<br />
So, for us [is] not difficult to establish Viṣhṇu Principle within us. But to recognize that we have those.<br />
You see, suddenly I find Sahaja Yogis become extremely humble, and they don't want to know what they have. You can cure people, you are a Dhanvantari. You can give Realization to people. All Viṣhṇu Principles are now awakened within you, and you must utilized. <br />
......<br />
But I think you should read the one thousand names of Viṣhṇu, [coughs] and you will know how many qualities you can have."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>This Great Brahma Śhakti Is At Your Lotus Feet</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Every time it's such a beautiful surprise to see how Sahaja Yogis are getting one with the Divine. The expression of their joy, the conception of the Divine, you can see very clearly.<br />
This is how I want you all to sit in the Kingdom of God as I am sitting today.<br />
[After 12 seconds:] We have to realize: that we are now the part and parcel of that Cosmic Consciousness Itself. The Brahma. The One that creates, which coordinates, which plans into all the details, and the One that loves through Its creation, through Its expression, is that Cosmic Consciousness.<br /> 
We are not only in it, but we can handle it, we can regulate it, we can use it, we can work it out.<br />
......<br />
But this cycle [of the five elements] is broken only by the awakening of the Kuṇḍalinī. Because you enter into the Highest of Highest, which is the Cosmic Consciousness-ss, which you know how to regulate yourself.<br />
That Cosmic Consciousness is the Param Tattwa, is the Principle of all the Principles, controls all the principles. So it controls also the Principles of all these Five Elements. It controls the Mana Śhakti. It controls the evolution, and gives you the power to evolve others.<br />
So this great Brahma Śhakti is at your lotus feet.<br />
......<br />
You are eternal bliss-ss and awareness, the consciousness: the pure consciousness."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>We Are Going To Pull The Whole Multitude Towards Ourself</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Today you have arranged this worship of your Guru, that is your Mother. Perhaps you are very unique people that have a Guru who is a Mother. <br />
......<br />
The Pūjā is arranged because you have been initiated into the Statutes of the Lord. You have been told what are the dharmas of a human being.<br />
......<br />
Let's see what are the Statutes. First is: 'You do not harm anyone.' First principle is that we are not to harm anyone. ...... Animals [human beings] are not to harm anyone! They can correct but not harm.<br />
......<br />
The second Statute is that you have to stu ... stand on your own legs and know that you are here one with the Truth, the testimony. The testimony of the Truth: that you have seen the Truth, you know what Truth is, and you cannot compromise with falsehood, you cannot.<br />
......<br />
Third is the detachment, the way I have told you about detachment: not to get attached to any one person, because he's a relation or a some thing, but develop a universal feeling. And also not to hate anyone!<br />
......<br />
Now the fourth thing, the fourth Statute of the Lord is: 'To lead a moral life.'<br />
......<br />
But today I authorize you to be the gurus, so that through your own character and through your own personalities, the way you practice Sahaja Yoga in your own life and manifest the light, others will follow you. And that you will establish the Statutes of Lord in their hearts and emancipate them, give them their salvation, because you have got your salvation.<br />
......<br />
Imbibe all the Statutes within you, and be proud about it. Don't be misguided by what people are talking, multitudes are talking. We are going to pull the whole multitude towards ourself. First of all let us establish our weight, the gravity. As Mother Earth keeps everybody pulling towards Her, we'll be pulling all of them to ourselves.<br />
......<br />
Today, all of you must, within yourself, to your Spirit, promise that you will be a guru worthy of your Mother. [Silence for 25 seconds.]"<br />

<font size="+2"><b>Surrendering Just To Purify Yourself, To Enjoy Yourself, And To Know God Almighty</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"For your own life, is very important that you should grow fully into the understanding of the powers that you have got and the love that your Mother has.<br />
When you say you must surrender yourself to Mother, means what? What do you have to surrender? Meah ... ah ... just think of it. What you are surrende-ring is what is pervert in you, whatever is destructively, whatever that misleads you, whatever is your ego and your conditioning. That's all you are sir... surrendering: just to purify yourself, to enjoy yourself, and to know God Almighty.<br />
......<br />
Somebody asked Me, uh, ``Is it necessary to have this Pūjā?", [laughing:] I think, if there's any Pūjā that you should do, it is this one, is [of] Ādi Śhakti. Is very important that this Pūjā must be performed. Because that is how you grow, this reflection improves, and you grow more and more within yourself, through the Power of Ādi Śhakti or through the power of Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
As you know that: Ādi Śhakti has Her own Kuṇḍalinī, which is the Ādi Kuṇḍalinī, and the reflection of that, within you, is the Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
So you have to worship. And is the best way to please your own Kuṇḍalinī, your own mother, who has given you this birth.<br />
......<br />
[After the offerings of gifts:] But one thing you have to remember that: you have a compassion that acts -- the compassion that acts. You are special."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>This Connection That You Have With Śhrī Mātājī Is The Only Connection That You Are Looking Out For</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Today, we are all going to worship Me, first time. It has been always the Pūjā of [an] aspect of Me or a part of Me.<br />
......<br />
So now, Ādi Śhakti had to assert, put the complete force-s-s.<br />
So, the first thing She realized, that one should know what is a family.<br />
......<br />
Under this circumstance, Sahaja Yoga started. And there I find: that, the Powers of Ādi Śhakti are much greater than the problems you see. I saw it very clearly Myself. Because these Powers are awakening the Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
......<br />
If you are not meditating, then I have no relationship with you.<br />
......<br />
In the beginning of course the meditation take some time. But once you will know what is meditation is, how you enjoy My company, how you are one with Me, how we can have a rapport with each other, there's no need to have anything else in between like writing letters or maybe some sort of a special connection, nothing of that kind. Only thing that is needed: is the meditation.<br />
In meditation you grow, in that spiritually you become higher.<br />
And when that happens, you start, in a way, I would say, that ... when you reach a state of that, I should say, maturity in Sahaja Yoga, then you don't want to give up your meditation. Because that time you are absolutely One with Me.<br /> 
......<br />
First it will be difficult, but after some time you will know that this connection that you have with Śhrī Mātājī is the only connection that you are looking out for."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>A Personality That Does Not React</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Something special has happened to you: that, the whole of Brahmachaitanya, the whole Ocean, has taken the form of a cloud, that's Ādi Śhakti, and has come on this Earth to shower the Chaitanya on you people, enrich you, nurture you, develop you, by manifesting the love in such a manner that you have entered into the body of the Ādi Śhakti.<br />
So like one pitcher which is in the River Ganges, you are like a cell in the body of the Ādi Śhakti. Your entity, your personality is preserved. Despite that, you feel the Brahmachaitanya through your senses, and you can give Realizations to others. But you are in the body of the Ādi Śhakti. As long as you are in the boy ... body of Ādi Śhakti, you can do all that.<br />
This is the greatest thing that has happened: the whole of the Sahasrāra has opened out with all the seven Pīṭhas of all the Deities, who were just part and parcel of it. The whole of it has come in the form of a Mother who is humble, who is [smiling:] deceptive, illusive, who is Mahāmāyā. Is the greatest thing that could happen to human beings and to the whole universe: that, now, you can get your Realization, you can give Realizations to others, you can understand through your senses, through your logic what is vibrations, what it does.<br />
......<br />
This aggressiveness has to go from your heart! It has to get out of it!<br />
There's no place in My body for aggressive people: no place at all. I have not aggressed you, and you shouldn't aggress Me. If you aggress any Sahaja Yogi, you are aggressing Me.<br />
......<br />
That's a very important part of S-s-sahasrāra, because ego covers a great part of Sahasrāra. And if your Sahasrāra is covered with this ego business, how can I help you and how can I help Myself?<br />
Now so many of you are in My body, just imagine, circulating fast, and most of them are fighting to be in My heart, but they are settling in My ego.<br />
Well, I am egoless! Because I have no reactions.<br />
If you have no reaction, you cannot develop ego.<br />
I've no reactions. I'm reactionless. I am in My own peace and glory, trying to work out Sahaja Yoga. I do not r-react to anything.<br />
But your reactions trouble Me, because you are within Me.<br />
......<br />
So, this kind of ... a crackness, or this-ss, what you call this-s-ss madness, aggressive madness, comes from ego going to the level of superego. And they go ... get, first of all, `What's wrong?'<br />
......<br />
So have that satisfaction and glory of your own being and of your own standard, and of your own caliber. The others are not of your caliber all right: forget about it.<br />
That should not give you ego, but should give you a personality that does not re-act! We have something of our own, we do not re-act to things! We are not reactionaries-s."<br />

To understand Me is even worse. [Laughter.] Because, you know, I'm Mahāmāyā.<br />
......<br />
So, tomorrow I'm going to tell you something which you have take ... you have to take with a very receptive mind. Ah, something very special. But you have to have a very receptive mind. If you are very conditioned, or your ego is there, which may be difficult.<br />
But Truth has to be told sometime. And i... if Truth is not accepted, it will express itself, but it will destroy many things. So best thing is to accept the Truth as it is.<br />
Accept it. Put it in your heart. Is a fact.<br />
