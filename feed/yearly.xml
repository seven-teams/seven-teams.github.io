<font size="+2"><b>You Are My publicity!</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"So, when you get your Realization, first and foremost thing you must know about your physical self, which is not known to you so far. As soon as you jump into the Unconscious, you have witnessed it: that you come to know about your physical being, first about your self. You come to know what is your physical problem, where are you suffering: automatically you know that this is what you are suffering from. You don't have to go to a doctor to ask him for what are you suffering from.<br />
......<br />
When you put your hands towards Me, you understand your position, first of all. You do not realize Me, but you realize your Self. Immediately you feel the burning, or you feel the cooling, or you feel the smarting, or tingling, or whatever it is, all that s not indicative of Me, but is all indicative of you. Then by the vibrations that are flowing through My being, they are corrected. All these problems are corrected. Then when your machine is corrected, then the same mach... machine that Myself emits the vibrations or you receive the vibrations which are really Me. But that to an extent ... to that extent, which you have achieved the clarity and the sensitivity.<br />
......<br />
Today is the day when a Mother is being worshiped as a Guru, and is a very unique thing. So far, mostly the gurus have been men.<br />
I too has [have] a Guru, and His name is Dattātreya. And this Guru is also created by Ādi Śhakti Herself. It's a very funny relationship that exists, because He is the father, He is the son, He is the brother: all the sublime relationships that can exist between a guru and a disciple who is a lady, who is a woman.<br />
......<br />
You will say: `Mother, what can we do? After all, what are we?' That's a way of evading the issue.<br />
But if you really want to see, you can do a lot. And that is what it is that: you are My witness. You are My publicity!<br />
So, today you have to take some vows. And you have to say: that, `We are going to do these things. We are going to talk about Sahaj Yog, we are going to propagate it, we are going to spread it. And what may come, we are going to surrender ourselves to Mother. Even, if She's supposing, scolds us, or says anything it is for our good. And we are not going to get confused.' And that's how you have to absolutely vow that you are going to dedicate yourself to Sahaj Yog to help others, to e... emancipate, and to create atmosphere for the completion of this universe, of this creation, for that fruitful day when we will say: that the Kingdom of God has been brought on this Earth.<br />
So today is not the day for Me to give, but for you. You have to announce."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>Receive More Of It</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"What is there to argue in Sahaja Yoga? You have to take, that's the point is, you have to take, there's nothing to argue. How much you take is the point.<br />
......<br />
Now, today tell your mind to rest for a while. Tell your thoughts to stop for a while, and receive, receive more of it. Everybody has benefited by this reception but you have to receive more. There's a capacity within you to receive.<br />
......<br />
There's another beautiful gesture I have seen, in Uzbekistan [in July], is very good. They put both the hands on their heart like this [show it], and just press it, bending their head, asking. See, [it] creates a vacuum. That's how they bow. [Ten seconds of silence.] Is beautiful!<br />
......<br />
In the Devī Bhāgavatapurāṇa it is written that the, "Pūjā to the Ādi Śhakti is the greatest Pūjā that can be done by any being."<br />
......<br />
Why these twenty-one names are taken, before every Pūjā? Even before the re-renovation of it, first you have to worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha. But even before worshiping, why these names are taken is important to understand. Everything has a why. Because these are the twenty-one channels within your Suṣhumṇā, twenty-one channels, we should say, in this complete Iḍā, Piṅgalā and Suṣhumṇā nāḍī. So, to raise you, [silence] absolutely to give you the ascent, twenty-one channels in Iḍā, Piṅgalā, Suṣhumṇā. So one would say seven channels in the Suṣhumṇā nāḍī. But these seven channels are divided, multiplied by, seven into three. So, every channel has got twenty-one inner channels. So, Suṣhumṇā nāḍī has got also twenty-one channels."<br />

"The most essential thing is: that our children should feel our presence, which will soothe him down, and make him a personality full of peace. <br />
......<br />
So, today is a day of our understanding, and a promise, to Me, that you will try to be good mothers. <br />
......<br />
Motherhood is the highest thing.<br />
......<br />
But apart from that, the idea of the education is that: that to instill in them, first of all, the sense of self-respect, to begin with. That we'll have to teach them what is self-respect and how to understand the importance of self-respect. And then they will be taught on those lines various things, like: `We must learn to keep our things properly, to keep the place clean and to respect it.' To respect your school, to respect your teachers, to respect all that is there."<br />

"It's said that, "At Sahasrāra, the Goddess incarnates as Mahāmāyā." Because the job She has to do is of a very different nature.<br />
At the Heart chakra, Anāhata, She has to just defend, just defend, the seekers from the clutches of the evil forces, which are also not so subtle. They are ... uh very gross ... like ... forms, human forms. And it's easy to fight and have a war with them, kill them.<br />
But at the point of Sahasrāra, the work is very complicated. First of all, the Sahasrāra of the human beings is itself a very complicated thing.<br />
......<br />
As it is this Mahāmāyā, no one can understand. Even Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, Maheśha could not understand, is so tremendous. It has played tricks on Them also! <br />
......<br />
Another point about Mahāmāyā is: you being the Mahāmāyā, you are not afraid.<br />
Supposing, Chaṇḍī has to stand here with Her sword in Her hand, nobody would dare go near Her.<br />
But despite that you people shake sometimes, I don't know why!"<br />

</p>

<p>
"Now, in the Dwāpar [Tretā] Yuga when Śhrī Rāma came, the idea of ... kingship, kingship, and rulership started. So-o, the greatest emphasis was on the goodwill of the people. The people had to have goodwill: for the people, and for the king, and for the betterment of humanity. The will, that is the right side.<br />
So how to create the goodwill?<br />
......<br />
First the leader has to sacrifice and show how far he can go in sacrificing to keep the moral and the goodwill of the people.<br />
......<br />
You see, 'formality of the heart'. You see to, not to say something, in such a way, that eh-eh-you touch the wrong side of the person ...... is saṅkocha.<br />
......<br />
So this saṅkoch one has to learn, the maryādā: means the boundaries of your relationships with [<font color="orange">unclear</font>].<br />
......<br />
The saṅkocha is a complete cultural stuff. So, we have a cultural tradition which we have to learn from Śhrī Rām.<br />
......<br />
Nothing works out without maryādā."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>Only Through Excellence You Will Really Become Sahaja Yogis</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Today we are here to worship the Resurrection of Christ, and also to thank Him for giving us an ideal life of a Saint who has to work for the benevolence of the whole world.<br />
......<br />
As soon as you are connected with Christ, the whole attitude has to change.<br />
So, to be connected with Christ means, 'What are the qualities of Christ you have imbibed within yourself?' That's the minimum of minimum. What did you get out of His life? Is it that He has cured people, all right, so you should get cured? He gave eyes to people, so you must get your eyes back.<br />
......<br />
When the Energy of Christ flows through you, you express Him.<br />
......"<br />
That's the first sign of a Sahaja Yogi, that he looks forward to that time when he can meditate. [Drinks water.] That is a time you're really in connection with the Divine and you enjoy the most.<br />
......<br />
So you have to judge yourself. This is the time for you to judge.<br />
You are in connection with Christ. He achieved His Resurrection, by which we have to achieve our Resurrection. But what have we done to achieve that Resurrection which He has achieved?<br />
......<br />
So you have to be awakened to this fact that we are Sahaja Yogis. We have a special responsibility as our connection with Christ is our main responsibility is all the time, intensely to think what we can do for the betterment of human beings. And what are we doing about it?<br />
First I used to say, "Count your blessings," because that was the best way to make people understand that there are blessings in Sahaj Yoga. Now I would say, 'Count your deeds.' What have you done for Sahaj Yog? Sahaja Yoga has done so much for you.<br />
To say that Paramachaitanya will look after is absolutely absurd! If Paramachaitanya could do everything, why should It create human beings? One Adam and Eve were sufficient.<br />
You have to do it. Unless and until you become deep, it, it cannot trigger, it is helpless. It's only through you it is going to work out.<br />
......<br />
Mediocracy [mediocrity] has no place in Sahaja Yoga. Only through excellence you will enjoy. Only through excellence you will really become Sahaja Yogis. Otherwise, you could be a headache to Me and to yourself. You would be a headache to Sahaja Yogis/<br />
......<br />
To be in connection with Christ is to be enjoying your meditation. 

All right. So Pūjā is another thing which is, I know it, helps you a lot. It gives you a definite push, I should say, but you don't retain it. You don't retain it, then what's the use? So also you have to retain, should have power to retain. That's only possible if you have touched your depths, which you have.<br />
......<br />
And I hope all of you come to Sahasrāra Day after very intensive meditative time. Otherwise, suddenly I'll find people who are doing Sahasrāra Pūjā with their all Sahasrāras caught up."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>Sahaja Yoga Is The Only Way (Is The Only Method That Divine Grace Has Given You)</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Birthday of your Mother, and all such celebrations, have a very deep significance. Because on such occasions, special vibrations flow in the atmosphere. When all the celestial bodies, the Eternal Personalities, Gods and Goddesses, s-s-sing the praise, and that's how the whole atmosphere is filled with mirth and happiness.<br />
......<br />
Mediation is very important after Sahaja Yoga. You have slept and slept all your life: sleeping is not so important. You have to today promise Me that, from tomorrow, you all are going to get up in the morning and meditate.<br />
......<br />
[Do] you know that Sahaja Yoga is the only way? Is the only method that Divine Grace has given you, by which you are going to transform the whole world.<br />
And lazy lumps, how can they help Sahaja Yoga? Laziness is the worst thing.<br />
Today, I know today is not a day to say all these things, but you all have to promise to Me, that: `You are going to give up your laziness,' Swāhā. That's what I have seen that, whenever I meet you people, you are caught up.<br />
......<br />
So, one has to take a very, very pragmatic attitude towards-s Sahaj Yog, and Sahaja Yoga related to ourselves.<br />
......<br />
But first and foremost thing is: that you have to be absolutely all right. You have to learn Sahaja Yoga, you have to know, you have to be experts."<br />

"And when the children don't respect their mothers because they have no respect for anything else whatsoever. In the first thing and the last thing is the respect for the mother. If one does not respect the mother, or the motherhood, that means he has no respect for himself either.<br />
So how does he exist? He exists through his mother. So mother is a very-very important intuition ... institution for the whole creation, for your creation and for the creation of your children and all the progeny that has to come.<br />
......<br />
But the mother who is your own mother, whom you know as your mother, who gives you physical birth, is the mother who gives you much more than you know of. Because her blood has her vibrations, and when she gives you her blood she gives you her vibrations, she gives her sustainance [sustenance], she gives you her desires and also she gives you a push in your evolution if she is a[n] evolved person.<br />
Now, in mother and the child relationship, mother gives a lot. She give[s] ... makes your complete left side. She creates all that left side in you. Because she has desired for you, so she creates that. On the right side she gives you all the beauty of delicate things. And also the hunches that you get in your business or all the flexible moments of your life that you think, `From where unknown I got something?', that's your mother's blessing on you.<br />
You choose your own mother, too, when you are born. So no use just condemning your mother because she's like this, she's a horrid woman, and she's this and that and that. Now, you have chosen her; so better have it.<br />
And she is a very big part of you, I must say.<br />
......<br />
It's a most responsible position is that of a mother. It is even a much more responsible than that of a king has it, to be a mother, because the king can only go up to material level, or up to physical level.<br />
And up to rational level, at the most, a philosopher can go.<br />
And the emotional level may be fulfilled by the wife.<br />
All these things may be done by other people, but spiritual level you can only achieve from your mother's grace."<br />
......<br />
So on this day of Mother Day I would like to bless you, that now you have to give birth to so many thousands of people.<br />
So the power that your Mother has, of giving birth, the spiritual birth, be bestowed upon all of you so that you do this work with the same grace and with the same patience and love and enjoyment."<br />
