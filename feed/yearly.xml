</p>

<p>
"Sahaja Yoga is very simple made easy, absolutely made easy. But still, we'll trust ourselves more -- isn't it? -- than the Divine. That's what everybody else does, but for [a] Sahaja Yogi it is important that: 'Leave it to Me.' I know how to manage. I know how to punish, and also I know how to save, and I know how to love. So leave it to Me.<br />
......<br />
So, first of all, collectivity has to be developed.<br />
......<br />
If you have to grow in Sahaj ... grow in Sahaja Yoga, first thing is: we must grow in collectivity.<br />
......<br />
So, today I say: that, 'Let us open our heart. Just like the flowers, we have to come up the tree. Let us compete in giving more, being nice to others, instead of criticizing.'<br />
......<br />
What is important it's: 'How you deal with each other and enjoy each other. How much capacity you have got to enjoy each other.'<br />
And that's the way you really transform yourself into a beautiful joyous personality, and others too."<br />

</p>

<p>
"Today you have arranged this worship of your Guru, that is your Mother. Perhaps you are very unique people that have a Guru who is a Mother.<br />
......<br />
The Pūjā is arranged because you have been initiated into the Statutes of the Lord. You have been told what are the dharmas of a human being.<br />
......<br />
The guru has to be a complete personality to talk about these Statutes and to elevate his disciples to this level of understanding, by which they imbibe those Statutes.<br />
......<br />
Let's see what are the Statutes. First is: 'You do not harm anyone.' First principle is that we are not to harm anyone.<br />
......<br />
The second Statute is that you have to stu ... stand on your own legs and know that you are here one with the Truth, the testimony. The testimony of the Truth: that you have seen the Truth, you know what Truth is, and you cannot compromise with falsehood, you cannot.<br />
......<br />
The third thing for a guru, in Sahaja Yoga has to do, is to develop detachment.<br />
......<br />
Now the fourth thing, the fourth Statute of the Lord is: 'To lead a moral life.' "<br />

<font size="+2"><b>Sahaja Yoga Must Grow Within You</b><br /></font>

<p>
"Today, it's a great day that you are here to worship your Guru in the realm of-f Hea... the Heart of the Universe. If we can do that in our domain of the heart, we don't have to do anything else.<br />
......<br />
That is how the Sahaja Yoga today is working out in all directions, if you find, to put all upside-down things into right direction, to expose it to reality, to bring all real values, to abolish all n... rotten value systems, all political, economic systems, all s-spiritual theologies, all psychological and all such nonsensical [some laughter] ideas into its proper direction.<br />
How in one In-a... Incarnation it has worked out. You can imagine: how in one Incarnation all these ideas s... have been put right.<br />
......<br />
Sahaja Yoga must grow within you. You should not be, anymore, regarded as immature Sahaja Yogis. I would say: a person who is a matured Sahaja Yogi is the one who can combine so many things together, with all beautiful lines, thin lines, thin maryādās maintained.<br />
But you cannot do the other way round!<br />
......<br />
So let us be in the center. We should be wealthy, but not too much. We should be healthy, but not too much. Uh we should be wise, but not too much. [Laughter, smiles.] 'So far, so good.'<br />
That's how we should move, so we keep to our maryādās, and we become beautiful Sahaja Yogis, who will be congenial to others, who'll be able to get others to... to us, who will be able to project an image of magnetic personalities. And this is what we have to do."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>You Are My publicity!</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"So, when you get your Realization, first and foremost thing you must know about your physical self, which is not known to you so far. As soon as you jump into the Unconscious, you have witnessed it: that you come to know about your physical being, first about your self. You come to know what is your physical problem, where are you suffering: automatically you know that this is what you are suffering from. You don't have to go to a doctor to ask him for what are you suffering from.<br />
......<br />
When you put your hands towards Me, you understand your position, first of all. You do not realize Me, but you realize your Self. Immediately you feel the burning, or you feel the cooling, or you feel the smarting, or tingling, or whatever it is, all that s not indicative of Me, but is all indicative of you. Then by the vibrations that are flowing through My being, they are corrected. All these problems are corrected. Then when your machine is corrected, then the same mach... machine that Myself emits the vibrations or you receive the vibrations which are really Me. But that to an extent ... to that extent, which you have achieved the clarity and the sensitivity.<br />
......<br />
Today is the day when a Mother is being worshiped as a Guru, and is a very unique thing. So far, mostly the gurus have been men.<br />
I too has [have] a Guru, and His name is Dattātreya. And this Guru is also created by Ādi Śhakti Herself. It's a very funny relationship that exists, because He is the father, He is the son, He is the brother: all the sublime relationships that can exist between a guru and a disciple who is a lady, who is a woman.<br />
......<br />
You will say: 'Mother, what can we do? After all, what are we?' That's a way of evading the issue.<br />
But if you really want to see, you can do a lot. And that is what it is that: you are My witness. You are My publicity!<br />
So, today you have to take some vows. And you have to say: that, 'We are going to do these things. We are going to talk about Sahaj Yog, we are going to propagate it, we are going to spread it. And what may come, we are going to surrender ourselves to Mother. Even, if She's supposing, scolds us, or says anything it is for our good. And we are not going to get confused.' And that's how you have to absolutely vow that you are going to dedicate yourself to Sahaj Yog to help others, to e... emancipate, and to create atmosphere for the completion of this universe, of this creation, for that fruitful day when we will say: that the Kingdom of God has been brought on this Earth.<br />
So today is not the day for Me to give, but for you. You have to announce."<br />

"What is there to argue in Sahaja Yoga? You have to take, that's the point is, you have to take, there's nothing to argue. How much you take is the point.<br />
......<br />
Now, today tell your mind to rest for a while. Tell your thoughts to stop for a while, and receive, receive more of it. Everybody has benefited by this reception but you have to receive more. There's a capacity within you to receive.<br />
......<br />
There's another beautiful gesture I have seen, in Uzbekistan [in July], is very good. They put both the hands on their heart like this [show it], and just press it, bending their head, asking. See, [it] creates a vacuum. That's how they bow. [Ten seconds of silence.] Is beautiful!<br />
......<br />
In the Devī Bhāgavatapurāṇa it is written that the, "Pūjā to the Ādi Śhakti is the greatest Pūjā that can be done by any being."<br />
......<br />
Why these twenty-one names are taken, before every Pūjā? Even before the re-renovation of it, first you have to worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha. But even before worshiping, why these names are taken is important to understand. Everything has a why. Because these are the twenty-one channels within your Suṣhumṇā, twenty-one channels, we should say, in this complete Iḍā, Piṅgalā and Suṣhumṇā nāḍī. So, to raise you, [silence] absolutely to give you the ascent, twenty-one channels in Iḍā, Piṅgalā, Suṣhumṇā. So one would say seven channels in the Suṣhumṇā nāḍī. But these seven channels are divided, multiplied by, seven into three. So, every channel has got twenty-one inner channels. So, Suṣhumṇā nāḍī has got also twenty-one channels."<br />

</p>

<p>
"The most essential thing is: that our children should feel our presence, which will soothe him down, and make him a personality full of peace. <br />
......<br />
So, today is a day of our understanding, and a promise, to Me, that you will try to be good mothers. <br />
......<br />
Motherhood is the highest thing.<br />
......<br />
But apart from that, the idea of the education is that: that to instill in them, first of all, the sense of self-respect, to begin with. That we'll have to teach them what is self-respect and how to understand the importance of self-respect. And then they will be taught on those lines various things, like: `We must learn to keep our things properly, to keep the place clean and to respect it.' To respect your school, to respect your teachers, to respect all that is there."<br />

<p>
"It's said that, "At Sahasrāra, the Goddess incarnates as Mahāmāyā." Because the job She has to do is of a very different nature.<br />
At the Heart chakra, Anāhata, She has to just defend, just defend, the seekers from the clutches of the evil forces, which are also not so subtle. They are ... uh very gross ... like ... forms, human forms. And it's easy to fight and have a war with them, kill them.<br />
But at the point of Sahasrāra, the work is very complicated. First of all, the Sahasrāra of the human beings is itself a very complicated thing.<br />
......<br />
As it is this Mahāmāyā, no one can understand. Even Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, Maheśha could not understand, is so tremendous. It has played tricks on Them also! <br />
......<br />
Another point about Mahāmāyā is: you being the Mahāmāyā, you are not afraid.<br />
Supposing, Chaṇḍī has to stand here with Her sword in Her hand, nobody would dare go near Her.<br />
But despite that you people shake sometimes, I don't know why!"<br />

"Now, in the Dwāpar [Tretā] Yuga when Śhrī Rāma came, the idea of ... kingship, kingship, and rulership started. So-o, the greatest emphasis was on the goodwill of the people. The people had to have goodwill: for the people, and for the king, and for the betterment of humanity. The will, that is the right side.<br />
So how to create the goodwill?<br />
......<br />
First the leader has to sacrifice and show how far he can go in sacrificing to keep the moral and the goodwill of the people.<br />
......<br />
You see, 'formality of the heart'. You see to, not to say something, in such a way, that eh-eh-you touch the wrong side of the person ...... is saṅkocha.<br />
......<br />
So this saṅkoch one has to learn, the maryādā: means the boundaries of your relationships with [<font color="orange">unclear</font>].<br />
......<br />
The saṅkocha is a complete cultural stuff. So, we have a cultural tradition which we have to learn from Śhrī Rām.<br />

Nothing works out without maryādā."<br />
