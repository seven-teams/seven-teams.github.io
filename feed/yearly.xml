<font size="+2"><b>The Right Side Movement Is The Collectivity</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Today is a great day, for all of us, because we are celebrating the Guru Pūjā and remembering all the Great Gurus who came on Earth to teach the world about the Truth. So many of Them were here. And They tried Their level best to explain to humanity what is spirituality.<br />
But is such a disparity that people never understood that spirituality is the most important thing we need, that we have to be one with the Divine Power.<br />
......<br />
That means: Sahaja Yogis can also become right-sided, but like Christ. Otherwise, if they are right-sided: they'll organize, they'll do all kinds of things and have problems of the right side. That's why I want you to avoid the right side.<br />
But once you are fully a left-sided master of Sahaja Yoga, then it's very-very much needed to be a Complete Personality of Spirituality, that you should take to right side movement. And what is the right side movement? Is the collectivity.<br />
......<br />
So, talk about this to everyone, bring them to Sahaja Yoga.<br />
Is a very important day, because, as a Guru Pūjā, they say that a guru canno-t give anything to you. But I can give you the advice, and the advice that you enlarge your heart, you become humble, and try to spread Sahaja Yoga with humility, not with aggressiveness. That is extremely important!<br />
If you can do that, then you'll do full justice to this-s life, which is a spiritual life. Without that you cannot achieve, you cannot achieve, the strength of spirituality. For that, you have to understand that it's very-very important that you should give Sahaja Yoga a full chance, through your wisdom."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>Love Means Sacrifice</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Why I asked him to talk to arrange a meeting with you people is this: because I've discovered that in Kali Yuga, specially in the West, the problem will be coming from the women.<br />
......<br />
I being a woman, you see, I can come much closer to you people.<br />
And sometimes people start thinking that uh the ladies have a special relationship with Me.<br />
......<br />
And specially in the West, you see, ah with this a woman's lib and all these nonsensical ideas have gone into the heads of even Sahaja Yogis. One of the conditionings they have.<br />
......<br />
Now, in Sahaja Yoga, nobody can dominate you. Because you are the Spirit, and the Spirit cannot be dominated. If you think you are dominated, then know that you are not a Spirit.<br />
So, now, we have to understand: we are women in Sahaja Yoga. And we have to understand our balancing power.<br />
......<br />
But one should be very proud that you are women. I am very proud that I am a woman. Because women can perform so many things which men cannot do. <br />
......<br />
Same, women in Sahaja Yoga are very important for Me. But the first thing they should have is a bearing power.<br />
......<br />
And also they should have lots and lots of love and compassion.<br />
......<br />
The Absolute Womanhood is the climax for you.<br />
......<br />
Love is the best way to control anyone. But love means sacrifice. But after some time you won't feel any sacrifice. Once you start enjoying, giving, then it is no more a sacrifice.<br />
......<br />
Women ha... have been given so many qualities, because their lifestyle is more difficult than that of men.<br />
So, I have to make one request to you: that you must try to make yourself uh-uh into a proper Sahaja Yoginī.<br />
......<br />
No, men are more intelligent, no doubt. But women have intuition. But you don't have to argue! It will happen, the way you have intuition will happen, and they will learn a lesson.<br />
......<br />
So, you see, they ... they ... special quality which is intuition must be developed. All right?<br />
Now see the difference, because you are deep, you are much deeper. In evolution you are higher, no doubt."<br />

</p>

<p>
"And today, as a first time, I would say again, to begin with, that I'm talking of Ocean of Love.<br />
If you were so perfect there was no need to have Sahaj Yog. There was no need to do anything. Should have been the simplest job, you see. Anybody could have done it.<br />
Because there are complications and problems, that somebody has to work it out.<br />
......<br />
Now, today we have, in our presence, Mister [Bhaskarrao G.] Pradhan, who is now seventy-six.<br />
And the he came to Me about twelve months ... twelve years back or eleven years back. He belongs to the first batch of Sahaja Yogis.<br /> 
And I've worked on them, about twenty-five of them, for two years. And after two years, only twelve of them got Realization. After two years, can you believe it? He's one of them.<br />
And the he is now going to America, because I'll be going to America so he wants to go and pave way for Me. He has come all the way from India.<br />
He is a lawyer, he's a[n] advocate, and he has held a very great understanding of Sahaja Yoga.<br />
He's helped Me a lot. Last time when I went to America also he came down.<br />
And he is our trustee. For we had to have a trust in India. Uh you cannot even get a hall without a trust. Then we had a trust.<br />
And ... uh-uh-uh, today there's a good news, that somebody has given us donation of one acre of land in Powai Lake area which is a very beautiful area, in addition to what that they had given us.<br />
So, I don't know, maybe that people who want to now have places there, they could come and meditate and sit down. So it's little far away from Bombay [Mumbai], about, say, that is about eight miles or so. That's a very, very quiet area, very quiet area and there's, there are two lakes there. Is [a] very nice place.<br />
And today only I received the message saying that somebody has donated that. I was very happy that they have donated us because we could not buy any, any land, because I said that, "We'll not give any black money or any bribery or anything, and the land has to be proper price. We'll not give extra money, would be public money." But some or other, now we've got some land there."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>Tremendous Task Of Creating Virāṭas Out Of Sahaja Yogis and Life For Us Is Nothing But Sahaja Yoga</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"And today what one feels that in America there's more dominance of the left side than of the right. Right side is our attention and the right side of attention is, we can say, is the liver of God Almighty.<br />
So now when we have to talk of the totality, when we are part and parcel of the totality, and now we are awakened to that existence of ours as the part and parcel of the whole, then we have to realize: to become the whole we have to do something about it. Specially in the land of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, we have to work out this tremendous task of creating Virāṭas out of Sahaja Yogis.<br />
After going through the various experiences of American Sahaja Yoga, I've reached the conclusion that we have to talk more frankly about things than we have been talking before: why there's such a failure of Sahaja Yoga in this great country while there are so many seekers.<br />
......<br />
In the same way the Sahaja Yogis of America have to work out because here it's so much superficiality and so much of frivolousness and also no meaning to their lives. They have no meanings at all and they are just frittering away their lives with all nonsensical ideas about their emotions and their love and all those things.<br />
......<br />
That all these souls which have died, I think, have possessed them, and now, today, America is on the left-hand side. The right-hand side of Americans is finished now. They are on the left-hand side: guilty, feeling guilty, they are taking to indulgences.<br />
......<br />
So, to become one part and parcel of the whole, a drop has to become the ocean, you have to become great people, you have to be responsible.<br />
And this lovey-dovey business that you have has to go out of your mind completely, otherwise Sahaja Yoga cannot work out in these two countries. And you'll be cursed one after another.<br />
There are shocks after shocks that are coming to this country as well as to England. But people are not learning any lessons from them. Still it is, 'All right, we get this disease, uh all right, then we glorify it. If ee [we] uh-uh-uh uh are suffering from ecological difference, still we are glorified.' If you are using too much of machinery out of balance, still, 'We are glorified.' Because they just want self-indulgence. Just for self-indulgence they don't want to see the point that what is going wrong with this country is that: that they do not see anything that is reality.<br />
......<br />
So the first thing a Sahaja Yogi has to do: has to make up something of his personality.<br />
......<br />
To become Virāṭa we have to really examine ourselves without any anger, malice or anything, but see for ourselves.<br />
......<br />
So you have to watch within yourself: that we are here for liberation, for complete freedom.<br />
......<br />
So first thing is to build yourself inside as well as outside.<br />
......<br />
But one has to think that: 'We have to change our lifestyle. We have to change our attitudes.'<br />
......<br />
Now, if you have to take to the Sahaj Culture, you have to know that we have to have a discipline in our life. We have to have education, we have to have a place, we have to have a position in the society. Because we are not sitting in the Himalayas, somewhere lost in the Himalayas sitting there and just uh-uh-uh-uh doing our tapasyā.<br />
......<br />
So transformation, of course, means evolution. It also means that whatever basis you had, you have to evolve out of it.<br />
......<br />
And I wish for you that you understand what I am saying today. And I request you, all of you, to be alert and dynamic and work it out. Each single person has to come up.<br />
......<br />
So on one side: the dynamism is to be used for yourself, and the dynamism is to be used for Sahaja Yoga.<br />
......<br />
Same thing is Sahaja Yoga. If you put mathematically, Sahaja Yoga can never be established in America if you add up more and more of this kind of people.<br />
......<br />
So when we believe that we are Sahaja Yogis, we have to know that in a subtle way we are still caught up into the webs of our own understanding about life.<br />
So that we have to change. Life for us is nothing but Sahaja Yoga, and Sahaja Yoga is nothing but enlightening ourselves and others."<br />

If you want to have an Āśhram, if you want to have a proper place, you want to look after your children well, you want to do God's work, everything is looked after, everything has to be worked out. If it is not worked out, then how will you do your work? So, it all works out.<br />
And is so obvious, the way we have different Āśhrams, such comfortable places, at a very reasonable amount that we ... we can afford, that we can live happily together. This is the abode created by love for you.<br />
......<br />
So the first thing we have to remember: that among ourselves, we should have complete love. <br />
......<br />
We should not trust people who try to ... divide us, who try to give us wrong ideas.<br />
It's very easy to make out a person who is a Sahaja Yogi from the heart. It's very easy to make out. You have to be [a] little more sensitive and you'll find out such a person very easily. Whatever may be the cunning, it can be discovered. Nobody can act against God now, because everything will be discovered and will be found out. <br />
......<br />
This is the point: that we build up our images about Sahaja Yoga also. We cannot build up: it is what it is. We cannot build up our's image. That we think, 'Sahaj Yog should be like this,' 'Sahaj Yog should be like that,' it cannot be. You cannot compromise. You just cannot compromise. It has to be what it is. It cannot be anything that you want it to be. You cannot mold it, because it is fixed long time back.<br />
Now, it is what it is, and that is why it is working out so well, so ... so efficiently. But to make it more efficient, you have to accept its working.<br />
......<br />
And this is the main point where we feel that uh-uh-uh Sahaja Yogis have to learn to accept with joy, with happiness, and not to project nonsensical ideas. Then only you will find your joy will be complete. Otherwise it will not be.<br />
......<br />
So you all people should also understand: 'Don't try new things in Sahaja Yoga.' Sahaja Yoga is a traditionally built thing. 'Don't try anything new in Sahaja Yoga'. Whatever we have is more than sufficient. You don't try anything new. People who tried new things have jumped into problems. So. do not try something new. <br />
......<br />
So be careful! There is no need to try new methods.<br />
Now you have jumped on to that awareness where you have to just be steady. So don't try at this point something new! Just steady yourself! Steady yourself in balance, that's very important."<br />

<p>
<b>Objectives:</b><br />
2. To achieve the evolution described in the foregoing para through the method of "Sahaja Yoga" which means effortless, easy, relaxed method of meditation evolved by Mātājī. To organize meditation centers for this purpose. This completely precludes all the external human efforts like rituals, worships, prayers, recitations, reading, renunciation (i.e. saṃnyāsa), worship of the preceptor (Guru) or any other physical expressions.<br />
10. To build and run Ashramas of Sadhakas for their use during Sadhana and to promote all activities expressing the new dimensions of creativity.

<font size="+2"><b>Perfect Knowledge About Sahaja Yoga You Should Have</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"And I told you that we have to understand that this is the greatest moment in the history, while you are born, and you are doing the highest work, that is of God, here. And you are specially chosen for it and how you must know that you are a Saint.<br />
......<br />
And today I find the negativity is also hurting Sahaja Yoga, very much, and Sahaja Yogis, through a very subtle method.<br />
......<br />
So in Sahaja Yoga, you can be misled very much, by so many things.<br />
......<br />
Specially it is very much in Europe, I find, and England and America: the women have become very dominant. And they know how to control men by telling them stories about how to look after the family, how to look after the children, how to do that. Sometimes is amazing! And you get lost with it. <br />
......<br />
Here, the women lack intelligence because they are so aggressive. They do not see the point! They do not understand who I am! They do not understand, `What is our worth?' To them, all nonsensical stupid things are important. Not all of you but some of you.<br />
......<br />
Now women have to understand they are women because they are compassionate, they are forbearing. They are like this Mother Earth.<br />
Their ego is so developed! Be careful about it!<br />
Why America is finished today? Because of their women.<br />
......<br />
This is a very common failing of the West! And I don't know what has happened to the men here, they feel so guilty, that they must become like slaves!<br />
......<br />
You have to be absolutely perfect, in perfect health. And perfect knowledge about Sahaja Yoga you should have!<br />
......<br />
I'm requesting you now, because you are the śhakti. You are the power behind the man. You are the one who are going to make them great. You are the one who are going to build up Sahaja Yoga as a potential energy. <br />
......<br />
In the marriage of Sahaja Yoga, you have given a promise to Me: that you'll work for Sahaja Yoga, and you'll help your husband in doing Sahaja Yoga, you'll help your husband when he's looking after other Sahaja Yogis, and you'll look after other Sahaja Yogis who come to your house. You'll make your house a Sahaja Yoga center, receive the people in your house, and will always try to enhance the collectivity. Under these promises you are married.<br />
So, now, coming to the major problems of the world, we have seen that I am talking about politics quite a lot these days, and maybe one day all of you have to enter into politics when the proper time has come.<br />
......<br /> 
But today the problems are much deeper than what we think of. A kind of a negative force, like a Hitler's force, is rising up through women of all the countries. Through women this horrible Hitler and all his Germans who died are taking birth. They are becoming like ... now, just like Nazis. <br />
......<br />
And I have to specially make a very important request to the women, that, in these modern times, they are the ones who are going to save the world, ot the men! They have done their job before. Now it is for you to save: with your understanding, with your compassion, with your sacrifices, with your wisdom. And the innate love: not only your children, your husband, your family, but the whole world."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>Tapaḥ Means Meditation</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"So just think, under what circumstances you got your Realization: without sacrificing anything, without giving up anything, without working out any one of these tapasyās, penances.<br />
Because Buddha is a Tapaḥ. These three Deities on your Āgñyā chakra: Christ, Mahāvīra and Buddha, three of Them are Tapaḥ. Tapaḥ means penance. You have to do penance.<br />
And penance now in Sahaja Yoga doesn't mean that you give up your wife or give up your husband, give up your children, give up your family life, but here Tapaḥ means meditation. And for meditation, you must know when to get up, that should be the most important thing for a Sahaja Yogi. The rest of the thing automatically will work out, and you'll understand: to grow your depth you have to meditate. Is a[n] absolutely simple thing: you don't have to shave your head, you don't have to starve yourself, you don't have to walk bare feet. You can sing, you can dance, I mean, you can entertain yourself with music.<br />
......<br />
But while you people look like really roses, beautifully, all of you are enjoying life, and everything is there, ut still one has to know that we have to have that Principle of Buddha within ourselves. And what is that Principle of Buddha? Is that we have to do Tapaḥ.<br />
......<br />
For example, some of you are like this, 'That I belong to this nationality, to that nationality. I am this, I am that. We are very proud of that. We cannot mix up with other people, we are too high for the other people,' or something like that. You are now become a Universal Being. So, you, how can you have these stupid limitations which are mythical again?<br />
Now, as it is, we can see there is light within us, what happens that we start seeing what's wrong with us and we just drop it out. But even when you see that, if you cannot drop it out, then must know that you need more of power. Then you must learn how to raise your Kuṇḍalinī, how to be connected with the uh Divine Power all the time, so that you are in thoughtless awareness and that you grow within yourself in a depth.<br />
......<br />
An enlightened attention reacts in a very different manner than a stupid attention or a confused attention, or the attention which is full of negativity. So, one has to judge how you react.<br />
Without coming to the collective, without being collective, you can never understand the value of collectivity. It is so great. It gives you so many powers, it gives you so much satisfaction and joy that one must in Sahaja Yoga first pay attention to collectivity.<br />
......<br />
If you can just pay attention to yourself as far as the defects are concerned, then I'm sure you will become much more collective than when you start seeing the defects in other people. And no use, I mean no use seeing.<br />
......<br />
So, with all these powers, with all these understandings, with all this compassionate love, you have to be sure about yourself and know that you are all the time protected, guided, looked after, nourished, and helped to grow by this Divine Power, which is all-pervading."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>The Greatest Thing That Has Happened</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Something special has happened to you: that, the whole of Brahmachaitanya, the whole Ocean, has taken the form of a cloud, that's Ādi Śhakti, and has come on this Earth to shower the Chaitanya on you people, enrich you, nurture you, develop you, by manifesting the love in such a manner that you have entered into the body of the Ādi Śhakti. <br />
So like one pitcher which is in the River Ganges, you are like a cell in the body of the Ādi Śhakti. Your entity, your personality is preserved. Despite that, you feel the Brahmachaitanya through your senses, and you can give Realizations to others. But you are in the body of the Ādi Śhakti. As long as you are in the boy ... body of Ādi Śhakti, you can do all that.<br />
This is the greatest thing that has happened: the whole of the Sahasrāra has opened out with all the seven Pīṭhas of all the Deities, who were just part and parcel of it. The whole of it has come in the form of a Mother who is humble, who is [smiling:] deceptive, illusive, who is Mahāmāyā. Is the greatest thing that could happen to human beings and to the whole universe: that, now, you can get your Realization, you can give Realizations to others, you can understand through your senses, through your logic what is vibrations, what it does.<br />
......<br />
First of all, I have taken you in My body. A foreign thing has to go in the body. And it has to be looked after, nurtured. But if you become troublesome, then you will be thrown out: I can't bear you.<br />
Some people are extremely troublesome. They do not meditate, they have their own ideas about meditation, they do not develop themselves, they do not mature, they live in the past or in the future, and such people are troublesome.<br />
......<br />
E ... it has to be [a] religious obligation that you must listen to Me, whatever I say. Actually you must obey Me! My hand obeys Me, My fingers obey Me, My Feet obey Me, what about you? Who are raised to the great dignity and the great position of being the Yogis in the body of the Ādi Śhakti, and they are acting as cells in My body.<br />
......<br />
And to keep Sahasrāra clear-cut, you must listen to whatever I have told you. Obey it as absolutely a[n] ordained thing.<br />
......<br />
Aggressiveness is one of the qualities in the West. And that also, is inherited by you people. They ... as soon as you put them onto something, they become aggressive.<br />
I can't bear it within Myself!<br />
......<br />
I've heard horrible stories about how some women, some men have become aggressive. With a little position they get, immediately they become aggressive.<br />
......<br />
This aggressivene... ...ness adds to the aggressiveness and ... of another person. Then reaction starts: one says something, the another says something. We become reactionaries! We haven't got something of our own, that we should be reactionaries‽<br />
There should be no reaction to anything!<br />
Because we have something of our own, why should we react to something, whatever people are doing to us, or have done to us? Is finished!<br />
Open your hearts!<br />
......<br />
Materialism! It's a ghost, it's a horrible devil, that has come onto the heads of Americans, and from them to all of us.<br />
This materialism is a horrible stuff. Is so ridiculous, shameful! Doesn't even suit a human person. Even a dog would hate such a materialism, to what level human beings have gone."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>Everywhere You Can Bring Sahaj Yog</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"The complete working of the Divine depends on you people, wherever you are. How many you are is not the point. Wherever you are, how intense you are, how you want to work it out, how you want to put uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh your attention to. Is very important: how you are going to do it. Because you people should understand the responsibility.<br />
This world is getting drowned and I feel that at least eighty percent people will be finished. Ten would be hanging in between in limbo I think, really, and ten percent will be Sahaja Yogis the way it is moving in the West. Maybe in India may not be, I can't say. India is very fast moving Sahaja Yoga.<br />
......<br />
The another māyā is of power. And the power of money if they can avoid, then they try to have power over territory, of the land, this, that. That also made them mad quite a lot in the past. But now they are all fighting for some nonsensical land which will never belong to them: it stays here pe... permanently, eternally. But the fights are going on.<br />
......<br />
And that is the thing is that: illusive. That illusiveness is called māyā. And this illusiveness appeals to many people. Appeals: that's the point I'm worried about. Some things is illusive, then they go on running after that like a mirage, and ultimately they are destroyed.<br />
So what you see, a picture just now is that at least so many ten percent people will be saved, at the most. But is a very sad affair because it has taken so much effort to make human beings, to make them all right, to make them sensible, and now what you find is that they are going to be all finished. Is too much to bear, too much to believe in, but it is going to happen, if you people do not take it up seriously and work it out.<br />
For you, also, there should not be any illusions, because many of you are more busy with other things. To you other things are more important than Sahaja Yoga. But whatever you are doing, you can bring in Sahaja Yoga into that. Into anything you can bring in Sahaja Yoga: I said in politics, in puh agriculture, in social life, in your jobs, everywhere you can bring Sahaj Yog. By your own behavior, by your own uh-uh-uhs intelligence, you can bring in Sahaja Yoga into every field, which you have to think about: 'Where can we take Sahaj Yog? Where can we work it out?'

<b>Objectives:</b><br />
14. To overcome the void between the material saturation and the unknown which is causing fear, restlessness, sleeplessness and tension leading to escapism from reality and false renunciation.<br />
21. To unite all genuine Seekers of Truth divided by dogmas and ignorance so that Satya Yuga (the Age of Truth) is born out of the present Kali Yuga (the Age of Darkness) rather than complete annihilation. To harness all the human resources to achieve this great task for which mass evolution will be needed..

<font size="+2"><b>You Resurrect People and Religion of Humanity</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"In our awareness, at least we should have feelings of compassion and love.<br />
But that one is lost. Is not there, we don't have it.<br />
The whole world is a flame, when you read about all the wars that are going, the way they are killing children, the way they are destroying human beings.<br />
It is a wrong attitude that with discretion of human beings, things will improve. It's a very, very wrong concept: that by destroying them, one can achieve something [unclear].<br />
Our work in Sahaja Yoga is doing well, I must say, but it has to stop this horrible attitude of human being to destroy.<br />
So you might ask then, 'What to do, Mother? What to do to destroy this destruction?' Answer is in the life of Christ: you resurrect people, you resurrect them, enlighten them, bring them to a state where they understand what is right and what is wrong. Let them feel, let them feel, the compassion and love that is within you. When that starts, that third force within us starts acting, our ego also comes down, our conditioning also comes down.<br />
For example, if we think, 'We are Muslims, we have a right to kill others,' if we think, uh, 'We are Jews, we have a right to kill other,' all these differentiations and this kind of discrimination that we have is so stupid, because: 'You are human beings, they are human beings. You are killing human beings!' Not that they have committed any sin or they have done anything wrong, except that, in their foolishness, they believe that they are this and they are that. You are not! You are just human beings.<br />
......<br />
You have got Kuṇḍalinī, everybody else has got Kuṇḍalinī. So you can only belong to the Religion of Humanity, where every human being has got Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
......<br />
For this, we have Christ. We have Christ, a person who was absolutely free: free from all kinds of prejudices, all kinds of temptations, all kinds of nonsense that human beings follow.<br />
But one may say that, 'Mother, after all, He was Divine!' He was Divine and now you are made divine also. <br />
So, how can we now join together to make a full effort, full effort to make, to tell people that, 'What are you doing? Why are you doing it? What is the need to do such things?' <br />
On one side is, we can say, a mass destruction through stupidity, another side is your own self-destruction. Take to drinking, take to-oo other self-destructive things which are immoral, that's very easily available, and people like it very much. And they don't like when you talk, that, 'This is destructive.' <br />
So, either we destroy others or destroy ourselves. Christ was destroyed by others, and He resurrected by Himself.<br />
So we are also in the same position now."<br />

<b>Objectives:</b><br />
9. To create a new generation of self-realized people and to render motherly protection to all such children against evil intentions and to look after their well-being.<br />
13. To employ the energy of love to overcome hatred that is the cause of wars, disintegration and destruction by publishing and relating the spiritual experiences of Sadhakas which prove the universal laws of love.
