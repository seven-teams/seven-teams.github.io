"You must know that the whole society is in a whirlwind, it's a whirlwind, you see. So somebody has to steady oneself, and stop, and try to change the winds. And that's why a Sahaja Yogi has to stand up, and understand that respect and reverence of parents is important.<br />
......<br />
This is the point: Sahaja Yogis must know that we have to change and transform ourselves. And that is the point [where] they feel bad. We are not only responsible for our change but we have to bring about the change in the whole world. Where the society is getting destroyed, the human beings are getting destroyed, so we have to stand [up]. So we have to change our way of thinking.<br />
......<br />
Vibrations, as I said that, is the manifestation of the Spirit.<br />
......<br />
Now the first power you have: is to correct yourself, without conditioning yourself.<br />
......<br />
In the same way, Sahaja Yoga is a tremendous Universe. And that Universe you have to move with that respect and love and understanding for each other. Arrogance to each other or saying hurting things to others, or even disrespect, even, you see,  showing your tongue and things like that, it should not be done. You are Saints, you are matured people.<br />
......<br />
You know, England is the Heart of the Universe, and how could it be that foolish? Just think of it: it's the Heart of the Universe, is the heart. It is heart shaped also. Is a very important thing, and that's why I am here with you. So try to respect it and respect its traditions."<br />

</p>

<p>
"So, today is the day of thankfulness for Christ's uh Advent on this Earth. And we have to see that, as He is our eldest brother, we can say, He is our leader, we have to how ... follow His foots... footsteps. In our Resurrection, we have to show that we have imbibed the qualities-s which are Christ-like, illuminating the whole Universe with our enlightened lives.<br />
The very big responsibility on Sahaja Yogis to understand that when we are celebrating today the birth of Christ, we stand for something very much beautiful, pure and glorious.<br />
......<br />
In the same way, we should try to keep our purity above everything else. The most important thing for us is to be pure people. Pure: pure from heart, pure in our morality, pure in our thinking and pure in our rapport that we have with others.<br />
......<br />
So the first and foremost thing we have to as... aspire is purity, as you know very well that Ādi Śhakti first created Śhrī Gaṇeśha who is the Symbol of Purity.<br />
So today we have to take a vow, that, 'Henceforth, we are going to follow a life of complete purity and detachment.' That's not so difficult if you understand Sahaj Yog. If you are Sahaja Yogis is very easy to purify yourself."<br />

"Only Blake has cried. He has cried of Jerusalem, and that's what I'm talking about. He could see that vision because He was that sensitive. He's the one who was a realized Soul.

"There's one more thing: I was happy to learn that the great poet of this country, Blake, had prophesied about Me.<br />
And it is so beautifully done, that He said that: "England is going to be the Jerusalem." We, this is going to be the pilgrimage. The venue has shifted.<br />
And then He has very beautifully -- have you got the thing to read? No. You haven't brought [it].<br />
But what reading! That: He has said that first thing furnace will be burning in Surrey Hills, where I came first, and then He has mentioned Lambeth Vale, where we have got our Āśhram. Where the foundations will be laid, we have laid the foundations.<br />
And that Jerusalem is going to be in England, not in India. And you are the people responsible for this Jerusalem. "<br />

"I would say Blake, William Blake, you read Him! You will be amazed! He is talking of today in His book `Milton'. He is talking of Jerusalem of today, this place, this England is going to be the Jerusalem, is the pilgrimage, where the people of God are going to be the Prophets.

<font size="+2"><b>Single-handed She Took Upon Herself The Responsibility Of Making The People Cross The Bhavasāgara</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"So when we read about the Devī, about Her Incarnations, how She came on this Earth to save Her bhaktas, people who were trying to ascend, to cross this Bhavasāgara, how She worked hard, how She fought the devils, how She cough... She killed the demons, single-handed, She took upon Herself the responsibility of making the people cross the Bhavasāgara.<br />
Guru gave you the strength to have dharma but She is the One who brought you out. Even those who were dhārmik could not do it because of the demonic pressure. She's the One who fought, single-handed, with Her Powers of destruction. In Her Love for you She fought. She brought you to this level.<br />
And then She took a milder form of Incarnation. Even during the time of all the Gurus, She took the Form of, as you know: Jānakī was the daughter of Janaka, then Fāṭimah was the daughter of Muhammad Sāhab, and Nāṇakī was the sister of Nāṇaka. In those Forms, these Powers s... sustained and nourished the Guru Tattwa. And later on, or sometimes simultaneously, They incarn-nated [incarnated] in milder forms to help human beings to rise.<br />
So, today is the Day of Thanksgiving. As Guru Pūjā is a day of thanksgiving to your Guru: the One who has counseled you, the One who has told you about the Truth, the One who has taught you the Truth and has given you Realization.<br />
And the Devī Pūjā is a thanksgiving where, single-handed, just like a very loving Mother, under Her sāṛī, She protected you, fought for you, fought with every enemy that is around, every sort of problems that existed, and ultimately brought you to Sahasrāra level and then gave you Realization. It's a real thanksgiving to the Mother.<br />
So we can say Navarātri is like a Mother's Day, where you give thanksgiving to Her: which was just relentless, continuous-s-s working for Her children."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>The Purity Should Be Such That It Should Purify</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Now, the brothers' and sisters' relationship has to be very, very strong. And the purity of that relationship is to be maintained. Is not necessary that you should be born as brothers and sisters, not necessary. But you are born, because if you are realized Souls you are born as brothers and sisters. So that purity must be maintained in the society of Sahaja Yoga. Very important it is. That we should try to develop this situation that brothers and sisters are something very pure. Their relationships are very pure. And they should not be at all challenged.<br />
......<br />
So first of all you'll be pure yourself and you'll accept purity, you'll appreciate puricy ... -ty [purity], [you'll be] sustained by purity. Any impurity will not collaborate with you or try to compromise with.<br />
That's why purity is your Mother's name. You know that My name is purity.<br />
And this purity is such that it pures [purifies] everything. It just purifies. The purity should be such that it should purify.<br />
Otherwise that purity has no meaning!"<br />

<font size="+2"><b>Life Is For Giving Joy To Others</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"So's today we are here to enjoy our joy. Our Ātmānanda, Nirānand and Paramānanda, all these we are here to enjoy, which are of eternal value.<br />
......<br />
So when you have joy, you have to be joy-giving. And if you are not joy-giving, that means there's something lacking in your Sahaja Yoga and that's why we have to come up now. We have to become Sahaja Yoginīs and Sahaja Yogis. That is joy-giving society. We can change our name, if you like, if not Sahaja Yoga is good: `Joy-giving Association'. [Laughter, laughs, applause.] <br />
......<br />
Gradually, you'll be surprised, only if you try, in your life, in your relationships, in your endeavors, to give light to others, to make their lives-ss better, not to show off, not to be egotistical, but in a very loving, beautiful manner, you'll really understand that you are the Spirit. Because Spirit loves. It loves. <br />
......<br />
So, you have to first understand that: life is for giving joy to others, because you are now Saints and your light has to give Joy."<br />

I, it's better that you discover Me than I tell you, because Christ was crucified, everybody was tortured. I do not want to hamper My work. Because it makes no difference by telling you anything before Realization. Is better to tell you after Realization that I am the Holy Ghost, no doubt.

<font size="+2"><b>You Replace It [EGO] By The Will Of Your Self.</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Now she asked Me, "What is the surrender?" Surrendering, as I am saying, that is to be done in three stages.<br />
......<br />
So the first point is to surrender by understanding rationally.<br />
......<br />
Ego and your will is to be found out. How? By finding out your Self.<br />
Now, what is your Self? Is the Spirit within you. All right?<br />
How do you know your Self? Because, after Realization, It vibrates and It tells you. So, your will becomes the will of your Spirit, not of your ego, because you have also superego.<br />
And with ego you have done mistakes, you have achieved no evolution. You have achieved nothing through your ego. But you don't trust your ego, don't challenge it, you don't over power it, but you replace it by the will of your Self. That's a part within you.<br />
The more you start learning about vibrations, learning what they are saying to you, how they teach you, you'll learn about your Self.<br />
......<br />
Now this is what is the surrender: is the space more there. Because you don't allow this to work out [ego], or this to work out [superego] but just allow a space. So it starts opening out.<br />
......<br />
Today, as we know that, this is the day of Muhammad Sāhab's Birthday.<br />
And we have to understand that all these Incarnations came at different times. They all came at different times. And They came as a continuous process of evolution of man.<br />
No question of conflict or anything with Them. No question. You see, human beings can't understand! Because they create conflict, they have lived with conflicts, you see.<br />
This thing is closing down, let's see.<br />
So They just came on this Earth, nobody's property. They came as Incarnations on this Earth, all of Them.<br />
He [Muhammad Sāhab] came after Christ. See His position! "<br />
