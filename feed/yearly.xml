"Firstly, you must see for yourself what is Sahaja Yoga, what it has given you. It has given you Realization, it has given you that wider vision, it has given you Collective Consciousness, it has given you thoughtless awareness and doubtless awareness. It has made a new personality out of you, like an egg becoming a bird.<br />
......<br />
But the best part of it: that I don't need Sahaj Yog, and that Sahaja Yoga does not need you. You need Sahaja Yoga.<br />
In itself, Sahaja Yoga is complete. It does not need you. It is a complete thing, will remain like that, absolutely. It will have its own position, its own status, its own dignity, everything intact.<br />
But if you have to get something out of it, you have to work it out."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>The Greatest Event Of All The Spiritual Happenings Of The Universe</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Today, it's a great day for all of us, the seekers, that the last work of the Divine, of opening the last center in the Great Primordial Being, was done on the fifth of May nineteen seventy [1970].<br />
It is the greatest event of all the spiritual happenings of the Universe. It was done with very great care and great adjustments.<br />
It is not in the limits of human understanding, how things are worked in the Heavens.<br />
......<br />
Without this happening, there could not have been a possibility to give [en] masse Realization to people. One could have done it for one or two persons here and there, but to give such a [en] masse awakening could not have been possible.<br />
As you know, in the Sahasrāra there are the Seats of the seven main chakras. There are one thousand nāḍīs or, as they call it, flames, and they all have each Sixteen Thousand Powers. Every nāḍī deals with a particular type of a person, and, with the permutations and combinations of all these nāḍīs, human beings are looked after.<br />
As soon as Sahasrāra was opened, the whole atmosphere was filled with tremendous Chaitanya. And there was tremendous light in the sky. And the whole thing came on this Earth, as if a torrential rain, or a waterfall, with such a tremendous force, as if I was unaware, and got stupefied. The happening was so unexpected and so tremendous that I was stunned, and I became completely silent at its-ss grandeur. I saw the Primordial Kuṇḍalinī rising like a ... like a big furnace. And the furnace was very silent, but burning uh-uh-uh appearance it had. As if you heat up some metal, and it has many colors, in the same way, the Kuṇḍalinī showed up like a huge furnace, say of a, I can say, uh of a furnace which is like a tunnel, uh-uh-uh where you see these uh ... plants uh you have for a coal uh-uh-uh burning ... to create electricity. And it stretched, like a telescope, one after another, it came out: tchue, tchue, tchue, like that. And the Deities-s came and sat on Their Seats, on Their Golden Seats, and then They lifted the whole of the head, like a big dome, and opened it. And then this torrential rain completely drenched Me. And I started seeing all that, and got lost into the Joy. Is like an artist seeing its own creation fulfilled, I felt the joy of great fulfillment.<br />
After coming out of that beautiful experience, I looked around and I saw human beings so blind, and I became absolutely silent.<br />
Then I desired that I should get the cups to fill this Nectar, but I saw all stones."<br />

Count your blessings one by one. Count your blessings one by one, I'll say again, count your blessings one by one.<br />

You are specially blessed people in the Heavens, and [you] are sent on this Earth to do this Mahā Yoga, to spread it. You have achieved that state. And if you are Saints, you should not be bothered as to few things like uh, 'Oh! I haven't got a suit,' or somethings like that, which you have never felt very nice on this.<br />
......<br />
Look at the little ones: how they came forward to give Me flowers, every step, every movement was so joyous, was creating such a beautiful delicate ripple in My heart. And it's written as history for Me to see these little, little sweet, innocent Gaṇeśhas coming forward.<br />
That in wisdom becomes so [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] that you know the Source of Love as Gaṇeśha [<font color="orange">unclear</font>].

<p>
"I have to tell ... I'll have to tell you the story about the Sahasrāra Day, about which it was decided, long time back, before I incarnated. They had a big meeting in the Heavens, all the thirty-five karoṛs [350 millions] of Gods, the Deities, were there present to decide what is to be done. 'This is the ultimate that we have to do to human beings: is to open their Sahasrāra, to open their awareness to the Spirit, to the Real Knowledge of the Divine, to remove the darkness of ignorance.' And it had to be spontaneously because it has to work the living force of God. Also it had to be very quick. So all the Gods requested that now, I, the Ādi Śhakti, has to take the birth.<br />
......<br />
It had to be before the sixth of May, because sixth of May was the Doomsday in that year. So it was done on the fifth of May at the nick of the time. It was all decided beforehand. And every Deity's job was allotted to all of Them, very efficient Deities, very obedient. They knew Me very well, completely dedicated and devoted, they knew Me eve... very, very well, every end of My hair they knew. I didn't have to teach Them protocol.<br />
Love itself gives you protocol.<br />
......<br />
What a tremendous task it was!<br />
So, I said, at Sahasrāra I had to be Mahāmāyā. I had to be Mahāmāyā. I had to be something that people cannot recognize Me easily. But Deities? No. This Māyā ... Mahāmāyā had to come on this Earth, not the Ādi Śhakti in Her purest form, is too much. So, She was covered with this Mahāmāyā.<br /> 
......<br />
And is already predicted that the whole world will come down at the Lotus Feet of your Mother and that you will decide the future of this world. Is written, already, fourteen thousand years back, and there's another one who is prophesizing the same."<br />

<p>
"It is such a pleasure for Me to be your Mother, and to be able to communicate the Divine, the Powers of Divine, the Beauty of Divine, to you. It was never possible before, as you know. Everyone tried their level best, but nobody could achieve it, to communicate that beauty.<br />
As you know, Sahaja Yoga, or this Mahā Yoga, is a very unique system: it never existed before. It has come into existence, of course, I should say that because the Parabrahma decided to take a form, but you also all decided to come on this Earth to receive the blessings. It cannot be possible to do anything with one hand.<br />
The beauty of Sahaja Yoga is great, no doubt, which I'm sure, very soon people will realize. That this is the only way. All lost people will come back to Sahaj Yog, I'm sure, and they will achieve what they are due.<br />
You don't have to do anything about Sahaja Yoga, you just walk in, and you can get Realization.<br />

It's a great thing that such a day has come that people are feeling it round the world that, 'It is a great day when the Divine decided to start this Mahā Yoga.' "<br />

<font size="+2"><b></b>And That Time A Great Mahā-yogi Will Be Born Who Will Be Completely Parabrahma, Completely Parabrahma<br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"And the here they have tried to establish how astrology is so correct. And whatever is predicted fourteen thousand [14,000] years back is also today coming up.<br />
But uh, this is about two thousand [2,000] years back, one of the great astrologers of this place, not Sholapur, but little downward, Karnataka, he described about this thing so clear-cut that, I mean, you will be amazed, that he said that: "This uh ... Great Yogi will come on this Earth on the Mīna Rāśhi," the Pisces.<br />
So, I'm just on the cusp of the Pisces and the Aries, you see. But that's not so important.<br />
Then he said s-sho... says that, "Gradually we'll start seeing some miracles in ninety ... from nineteen sixty-four [1964] to sixty-six [1966] [a Sahaja Yogi is amazed], which he says that, maybe little bit. But he says, "The ... the real change, Manvantar [period or age of a Manu], in the age, the New Age, He will start from nineteen seventy [1970]."<br />
......<br />
... the New Age will be formed, and this, the old one, Vaivas... Vaivastav -- you see, there's one, another -- we have yugas, you see, one of the yugas -- will be over, and that yuga is in Kali Yuga. So that's how Kali Yuga will be finished, from nineteen seventy [1970].<br /> 
......<br />
New Age of Active Divinity, Kṛuta Yuga will start. Al right.<br />
[After a comment of a Sahaja Yogi:] That time, that time, the Sun will rule in a new way, the Sun. The axis of Earth will be reduced and the speed of the Earth will be reduced, gradually.<br />
And that time a Great Mahā-yogi will be born who will be completely Parabrahma, completely Parabrahma.<br />
That's Me."<br />

</p>

<p>
"There are lots of things that are happening within you. There are cosmic changes that are taking place today within you. I know that it's happening.<br />
The Śhrī Chakra Itself has descended on this Earth and already the Satya Yuga has started. This is the reason why you are feeling these vibrations on your fingers, and none of these Gurus and Ṛiṣhis and all those people have mentioned these things. Because this is only possible when the Śhrī Chakra is brought down.<br />
It is here. You have to feel it and understand it. It is for all of you to accept it with a[n] open heart.<br />
I do not want anything from you. What can you give Me? I do not want anything, but I want My children to be happy. I pray for their happiness. I live for them and all the time, whether I am asleep or a... awakened or in the middle state, when they call the sambhrānta [confused (state)], I am just with you. Every moment you are in My thought."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>Your Property Is Your Spirit</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"We have to understand that we have risen above our human awareness. And, at that level, we were different, and at this new awareness we are different people. And all our priorities must change. Our value system has to change.<br />
.......<br />
And no more of all the falsehood of human awareness should be attached to us, or we should be bothered about it.<br />
......<br />
Your property is your Spirit. And your priorities are: where you can manifest your Spirit and can feel the Spirit of others.<br />
......<br />
But now the time has come for you to enjoy Sahaja Yoga. You have so many friends, you have so many relations, you have the complete uh-uh-uh ... group, such a big group, which may, can be called as a religion, which is with you, so you don't suffer at all. You just enjoy all the time.<br />
......<br />
Once you realize that, such a person becomes extremely humble, extremely conducive, and he can articulate, in a very beautiful manner, with other people, and you never feel that he is your boss but you feel he is your father. He's looking after you, with love and affection. But in that love there's no expectation at all, except that of giving.<br />
And this giving is the most beautiful thing Sahaja Yogis can do."<br />

"But if you stay in the center, that's the fourth side: is staying in the center. Turīya: is uhs ... sfourth ... fourth dimension. If you could stay on that, then you become a witness. And that's the point where you start sucking the joy of every moment. Every moment: of every doing, of every work, of every friendship, of every relationship, of every understanding.<br />
......<br />
So we have to give up our misidentifications with our previous styles of life, pre... previous types of living, previous type of executing any work. And we have to understand that we are not to plan. This house is built for Me. I'm the Power [laughing:] behind the whole universe, so, you don't have to plan. You just start off. 
......<br />
So, once you understand that we are not to worry about these things, which the people worry. We are not to worry about things which ... for which people just uh give their lives.<br />
We are here for joy! And joy will come to us, whatever it is! So we should seek joy, happiness, friendship.<br />
.......<br />
So the more you are in collectivity and in the blessing state, the better it could be always for you, in your other life, other thing also.<br />
......<br />
And so you all have to prepare yourself: talk about it. So there should be no more silence. There should be no more silence.<br />
......<br />
You must speak, you must talk about it. You must give Realization. Move your hands, move your legs. You have to walk across. For God's work, even if you have to beg you have to do that. This is God's work. Our has to do that, God's work, with all dedication, with all surrendering, and with all love and enjoyment."<br />

<b>Objectives:</b><br />
2. To achieve the evolution described in the foregoing para through the method of ``Sahaja Yoga" which means effortless, easy, relaxed method of meditation evolved by Mātājī. To organize meditation centers for this purpose. This completely precludes all the external human efforts like rituals, worships, prayers, recitations, reading, renunciation (i.e. saṃnyāsa), worship of the preceptor (Guru) or any other physical expressions.<br />
5. To introduce the only one internal living religion lying dead and camouflaged under external practices and precepts of religion in all the human beings and for this to organize tours and hold spiritual meetings as per wishes of Mātājī.<br />
22. To open, organize and run local centers of the Life Eternal Institution in various parts of India and in foreign countries, the centers being opened on the distinct understanding that meditation is the path of the entire human destiny, and that all barriers of states, nations and races are artificial and irrelevant to Life Eternal.<br />
