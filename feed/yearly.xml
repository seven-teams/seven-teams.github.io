<p>
"Now she asked Me, "What is the surrender?" Surrendering, as I am saying, that is to be done in three stages.<br />
......<br />
So the first point is to surrender by understanding rationally.<br />
......<br />
The more you start learning about vibrations, learning what they are saying to you, how they teach you, you'll learn about your Self.<br />
......<br />
Attention is not in the mind alone! Attention is all along. And is generated through your ... Is generated, I mean it is not generated we should say, but we can say it is, it is a sort of, looked after or maintained or a... attend[ed] to, through your liver. But, you see, the evolution of mind, as the mind grows up, you will see this attention becomes improved.<br />
......<br />
Then above, the God's Attention is not like yours. You see, your attention is much more than anyone ... that an animal's attention is, that you can realize. But God's Attention is manifold dynamic than yours is. So when you become [one] with That, you see, that Attention, becomes your attention: it starts flowing through you. So it forms in another way, that is the God's Attention, and you start getting the vibrations in the hand.<br />
......<br />
And you develop that sort of a sheath here, you can say, and you start feeling the vibrations. But again, when you go this way a little bit more, it stops. Or this way more, it stops. Again you bring it in the center, and gradually allow the space to be more. Now this is what is the surrender: is the space more there. Because you don't allow this to work out [ego], or this to work out [superego] but just allow a space. So it starts opening out.<br />
......<br />
When you allow this space to increase more, you see, then what happens: these chakras also open out. In these chakras your own Deities are there. They have their own thing and they are one with it, you see. So it works in unison. And that's why the integration takes place.<br />
But this spacing, leaving this space itself, means surrender, in the normal way understanding. Because the Dynamic is there. [The] Dynamic is all-pervading, is working out. All right? It is all knowing. It is working out Its job. It is correct. But the problem is: your attention has not grown that subtle, is to enter into It. One [when] it becomes that subtle -- only human beings can become that -- it opens out this thing."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>Sahaja Yogis Have To Be Perfect</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Today I want to tell you about further meditation: how we have to do and how we have to understand ourselves.<br />
......<br />
But now, as you have entered into the Kingdom of God and the Power of God is flowing through you, you must know that your solutions and your styles have to be different now, that is, you have to put your attention at the disposal of God.<br />
......<br />
Your attention itself is now flooded with light. You do not have to go to any books, you do not have to go anywhere. Your attention itself is flooded with that light, which is dynamic.<br />
Now, if anything comes [to] your attention, you just connect your attention with the Divine's Attention. How? By saying, 'All right, let it be done. Let this be done, is Your wish.' "Thy will be done." This is what you should say: "Thy will be done."<br />
You just say this, you will be surprised. And then the whole mechanism, that enlightened attention of yours is the part of the attention of God Itself. So the whole thing will work out, the whole force as you have worked for your personal problem before, now the whole of it will work out and it will happen. It's such a wonderful thing.<br />
......<br />
To approach to the problem is only possible if you are a subtle being. If you are not a subtle being you cannot approach any problem.<br />
......<br />
I think we should really write it down all the things that have to be done to look after your body. That is very important.<br />
......<br />
Good health is possible only if you understand the balance in that person, every understanding about how the body acts and what happens to body, small, small things.<br />
......<br />
You see, Sahaja Yogis have to be pe... perfect, absolutely perfect."<br />

"We have to understand that people are not normal in these modern times. There's something going wrong with them somewhere. It may be something serious is happening within us, which is giving such a collective effect outside.<br />
Now the trouble is: we do not know what we are inside. Unless and until we know what we are, unless and until there is light within us, we cannot understand what's the problem with us is.<br />
......<br />
Today the war is within, within ourselves, not without. We are not realizing how it is building up within ourselves.<br />
......<br />
On the whole, England is the heart of the whole universe. From here, everything circulates.<br />
You have no idea of this country. You have no esteem of this country. The way we have tortured our Motherland here, I wish people could know! She is suffering within Herself.<br />
Only Blake has cried. He has cried of Jerusalem, and that's what I'm talking about. He could see that vision because He was that sensitive. He's the one who was a realized Soul. And He was that sensitive, He could feel it. And the way He has described, the way He has talked, the glory of this country.<br />
All this inertia, all this lethargy, all these curses that are settling into this country are because of our foolishness and stupidity.<br />
You are the most dynamic people. And not only that, in spirituality you are very dynamic. For your spiritual work, you can be very, very dynamic. You are the ones who are going to throw away all the shackles of nonsense and you are the one who are groing [going] to recreate a beautiful arena of for the whole world."<br />

</p>

<p>
"Now I always enjoyed Hampstead. Because, as I have told you, in London, many people who were great spiritual[s] lived in this area. They preferred it to other places. So, I believe that many people who live in this area must be also spiritual, must have taken their birth with the idea of achieving their Self-realization.<br />
......<br />
Then why not grow? When are we going to grow? When are we going to become fully that? Time is very short, My children. Time is very, very short. Believe Me!<br />
......<br />
So, one has to understand that, unless and until we develop that basic humility within ourselves, we are not going to do very well in England. It's for all the Sahaja Yogis as well as for people who have come here.<br />
It's a very, very, serious problem, and you are placed in the most vital parts of the universe, that is, this England, that's the Heart!<br />
And if you now, any way, escape your responsibility, you will be held responsible. I am telling you now very strongly! Because today I had big lectures from people saying that, "Mother, You don't say things strongly, and people are to be frightened." I don't's want to frighten you, but you will be held responsible, take it from Me. You are born on this Earth, on this great land for a very great purpose: to create Jerusalem out of this. And now if you run, not going to stand up, you'll be held responsible.<br />
This is what it is. It's a tremendous work one has to do, for which you must prepare yourself. Get to it. I can give Realization, that's all. But I can't give you strength. I mean, you can't make the horse stand up on his four legs, can you?<br />
......<br />
I want you to grow. Not because I want, but Divine wants it. The whole Creation wants it. Otherwise it will have no meaning.<br />
So the responsibility of English Sahaja Yogis, British Sahaja Yogis is very great. Again and again I have requested you and I have told you in whatever way possible, that [you] establish yourself."<br />

"You must know that the whole society is in a whirlwind, it's a whirlwind, you see. So somebody has to steady oneself, and stop, and try to change the winds. And that's why a Sahaja Yogi has to stand up, and understand that respect and reverence of parents is important.<br />
......<br />
This is the point: Sahaja Yogis must know that we have to change and transform ourselves. And that is the point [where] they feel bad. We are not only responsible for our change but we have to bring about the change in the whole world. Where the society is getting destroyed, the human beings are getting destroyed, so we have to stand [up]. So we have to change our way of thinking.<br />
......<br />
Vibrations, as I said that, is the manifestation of the Spirit.<br />
......<br />
Now the first power you have: is to correct yourself, without conditioning yourself.<br />
......<br />
In the same way, Sahaja Yoga is a tremendous Universe. And that Universe you have to move with that respect and love and understanding for each other. Arrogance to each other or saying hurting things to others, or even disrespect, even, you see,  showing your tongue and things like that, it should not be done. You are Saints, you are matured people.<br />
......<br />
You know, England is the Heart of the Universe, and how could it be that foolish? Just think of it: it's the Heart of the Universe, is the heart. It is heart shaped also. Is a very important thing, and that's why I am here with you. So try to respect it and respect its traditions."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>We Are Going To Follow A Life Of Complete Purity And Detachment</b></font>
</p>

<p>
"So, today is the day of thankfulness for Christ's uh Advent on this Earth. And we have to see that, as He is our eldest brother, we can say, He is our leader, we have to how ... follow His foots... footsteps. In our Resurrection, we have to show that we have imbibed the qualities-s which are Christ-like, illuminating the whole Universe with our enlightened lives.<br />
The very big responsibility on Sahaja Yogis to understand that when we are celebrating today the birth of Christ, we stand for something very much beautiful, pure and glorious.<br />
......<br />
In the same way, we should try to keep our purity above everything else. The most important thing for us is to be pure people. Pure: pure from heart, pure in our morality, pure in our thinking and pure in our rapport that we have with others.<br />
......<br />
So the first and foremost thing we have to as... aspire is purity, as you know very well that Ādi Śhakti first created Śhrī Gaṇeśha who is the Symbol of Purity.<br />
So today we have to take a vow, that, 'Henceforth, we are going to follow a life of complete purity and detachment.' That's not so difficult if you understand Sahaj Yog. If you are Sahaja Yogis is very easy to purify yourself."<br />

<p>
"Only Blake has cried. He has cried of Jerusalem, and that's what I'm talking about. He could see that vision because He was that sensitive. He's the one who was a realized Soul. And He was that sensitive, He could feel it. And the way He has described, the way He has talked, the glory of this country."<br />

<p>
"There's one more thing: I was happy to learn that the great poet of this country, Blake, had prophesied about Me.<br />
And it is so beautifully done, that He said that: "England is going to be the Jerusalem." We, this is going to be the pilgrimage. The venue has shifted.<br />
And then He has very beautifully -- have you got the thing to read? No. You haven't brought [it].<br />
But what reading! That: He has said that first thing furnace will be burning in Surrey Hills, where I came first, and then He has mentioned Lambeth Vale, where we have got our Āśhram. Where the foundations will be laid, we have laid the foundations.<br />
And that Jerusalem is going to be in England, not in India. And you are the people responsible for this Jerusalem. "<br />

<p>
"I would say Blake, William Blake, you read Him! You will be amazed! He is talking of today in His book `Milton'. He is talking of Jerusalem of today, this place, this England is going to be the Jerusalem, is the pilgrimage, where the people of God are going to be the Prophets. He has talked of today, can you imagine‽ He was not very old, He was not very ancient: very modern. He has prophesized about these days and it is happening."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>Single-handed She Took Upon Herself The Responsibility Of Making The People Cross The Bhavasāgara</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"So when we read about the Devī, about Her Incarnations, how She came on this Earth to save Her bhaktas, people who were trying to ascend, to cross this Bhavasāgara, how She worked hard, how She fought the devils, how She cough... She killed the demons, single-handed, She took upon Herself the responsibility of making the people cross the Bhavasāgara.<br />
Guru gave you the strength to have dharma but She is the One who brought you out. Even those who were dhārmik could not do it because of the demonic pressure. She's the One who fought, single-handed, with Her Powers of destruction. In Her Love for you She fought. She brought you to this level.<br />
And then She took a milder form of Incarnation. Even during the time of all the Gurus, She took the Form of, as you know: Jānakī was the daughter of Janaka, then Fāṭimah was the daughter of Muhammad Sāhab, and Nāṇakī was the sister of Nāṇaka. In those Forms, these Powers s... sustained and nourished the Guru Tattwa. And later on, or sometimes simultaneously, They incarn-nated [incarnated] in milder forms to help human beings to rise.<br />
So, today is the Day of Thanksgiving. As Guru Pūjā is a day of thanksgiving to your Guru: the One who has counseled you, the One who has told you about the Truth, the One who has taught you the Truth and has given you Realization.<br />
And the Devī Pūjā is a thanksgiving where, single-handed, just like a very loving Mother, under Her sāṛī, She protected you, fought for you, fought with every enemy that is around, every sort of problems that existed, and ultimately brought you to Sahasrāra level and then gave you Realization. It's a real thanksgiving to the Mother.<br />
So we can say Navarātri is like a Mother's Day, where you give thanksgiving to Her: which was just relentless, continuous-s-s working for Her children."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>The Purity Should Be Such That It Should Purify</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Now, the brothers' and sisters' relationship has to be very, very strong. And the purity of that relationship is to be maintained. Is not necessary that you should be born as brothers and sisters, not necessary. But you are born, because if you are realized Souls you are born as brothers and sisters. So that purity must be maintained in the society of Sahaja Yoga. Very important it is. That we should try to develop this situation that brothers and sisters are something very pure. Their relationships are very pure. And they should not be at all challenged.<br />
......<br />
So first of all you'll be pure yourself and you'll accept purity, you'll appreciate puricy ... -ty [purity], [you'll be] sustained by purity. Any impurity will not collaborate with you or try to compromise with.<br />
That's why purity is your Mother's name. You know that My name is purity.<br />
And this purity is such that it pures [purifies] everything. It just purifies. The purity should be such that it should purify.<br />
Otherwise that purity has no meaning!"<br />
