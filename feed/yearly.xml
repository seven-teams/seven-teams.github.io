"India has now won back its democracy and the leaders are talking of Gāndhījī. That is a very big step forwards towards the new style of government. Gāndhījī believed in LOVE of God. He believed in Dharma. He believed in integration."<br />

"I think we went to see Gāndhījī's āśhram, didn't we? You saw: it was a simple place, but very well done, everything. <br />
......<br />
Now what has happened: by doing this kind of a top-heavy work, some muck has come up [through,  "Scheduled Caste must have equal seats"]. And they're some absolutely useless people, they cannot do administration.<br />
Instead of that, what Gāndhījī had said: that, "Train them up. Educate them. Bring them up." Suddenly the educated people are there, and some people suddenly, uneducated, nothing, brought to that, they cannot bear it!<br />
......<br />
Gāndhījī suggested these things. He said that, "You must enlighten the rich people and you must also try to emancipate these people by education, by making them understanding," and all that."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>You Actually Become Creative Under The Influence Of The Divine</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"The subject is very interesting, that, 'How Sahaja Yoga can help beauty?'<br />
......<br />
So, the first thing, I would say that when it happens, you don't react. You just watch, you become a witness: you become the witness of the whole thing.<br />
And when these things happen, then the creativity starts coming from somewhere unknown, and you are amazed how you can create things without reading any book, without taking any help. And suddenly you become very, very creative.<br />
I have seen in Sahaja Yoga, how people have achieved great heights in creativity, in sports, in everything, because they get this energy, divine energy within them.<br />
So, they also understand, that they have to be more patient, more loving, more caring towards themselves and towards others also.<br />
......<br />
You do not borrow ideas from others, you don't learn by your own mad thinking, but you actually become creative under the influence of the Divine.<br />
And when the Divine starts working, is perfect, perfection. There's no competition. You create not out of competition, but just to create, freely. There's no compulsion.<br />
......<br />
And exposure of knees is very dangerous.<br />
......<br />
That is the main point you should have: is your concentration.<br />
And this concentration if it doesn't come, then you cannot work out anything.<br />
......<br />
To get angry is very wrong! To get angry is absolutely ruining yourself, is self-destructive.<br />
......<br />
Is a very, very great copacity [capacity] to be emotionally intelligent."<br />

I will see that Sahaja Yoga is fully established. This is My promise to you.<br />
[After 11 seconds with the right palm lowered and not any more stretched:] Saṃsthāpanārthāya. He ... He comes on this Earth again to establish the Religion. But not only religion but Vishwa Nirmal Dharm, which is a much higher religion than the ordinary religion of human beings.

So many aspects, of His being, have been described in so many of My lectures to you all. But the greatest on greatest of all the aspect[s] of this Primordial Being was that: He was the Yogeśhwara. He was the God of Yoga -- Yogeśhwara. He was the Lord of our Union with the Divine.<br />
Without His permission, or without His sanction, we cannot be Sahaja Yogis. <br />
......<br />
So, to worship Yogeśhwara, we must know that our relationships with everyone in this world has [have] to be pure.<br />

We have to worship Him. Means: our relationships about these things has [have] to be cleaned.<br />
We should not get involved into, it's nothing important.<br />

What do [does] happen, when you worship? You surrender all that is not liked by Me. In the fire, in the water, outside, in the elements you throw them away. And you bring to Me your heart. That's what is worshiping is."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>I Reside Within You As Chastity</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the first Deity that was created, so that the whole Universe is filled with auspiciousness, with peace, bliss, and spirituality. He is the Source. He's the Source of Spirituality.<br />
......<br />
But it has been so unfortunate, specially in the West, that the most important, fundamental Deity has been, completely, not only neglected but insulted and crucified.<br />
......<br />
But first of all chastity pays dividend in your good health!<br />
......<br />
And the vehicle we have is our chastity!"<br />
......<br />
So, respecting your chastity is real respecting Me, because I reside within you as chastity. If Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the auspiciousness, I reside within you as chastity.<br />
Chastity is never aggressive, is never harsh. Because there's no need, you know! No need, you are so powerful. You are so powerful, that there's no need to aggress anyone. Why should you aggress? You are not frightened of anyone.<br />
It's so generous, it's so kind, it's so beautiful, always fresh and young, yet so sublime and so dignified.<br />

<font size="+2"><b>Leave It To Me</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Sahaja Yoga is very simple made easy, absolutely made easy. But still, we'll trust ourselves more -- isn't it? -- than the Divine. That's what everybody else does, but for [a] Sahaja Yogi it is important that: 'Leave it to Me.' I know how to manage. I know how to punish, and also I know how to save, and I know how to love. So leave it to Me.<br />
......<br />
So, first of all, collectivity has to be developed.<br />
......<br />
If you have to grow in Sahaj ... grow in Sahaja Yoga, first thing is: we must grow in collectivity.<br />
......<br />
So, today I say: that, 'Let us open our heart. Just like the flowers, we have to come up the tree. Let us compete in giving more, being nice to others, instead of criticizing.'<br />
......<br />
What is important it's: 'How you deal with each other and enjoy each other. How much capacity you have got to enjoy each other.'<br />
And that's the way you really transform yourself into a beautiful joyous personality, and others too."<br />

</p>

<p>
"Today you have arranged this worship of your Guru, that is your Mother. Perhaps you are very unique people that have a Guru who is a Mother.<br />
......<br />
The Pūjā is arranged because you have been initiated into the Statutes of the Lord. You have been told what are the dharmas of a human being.<br />
......<br />
The guru has to be a complete personality to talk about these Statutes and to elevate his disciples to this level of understanding, by which they imbibe those Statutes.<br />
......<br />
Let's see what are the Statutes. First is: 'You do not harm anyone.' First principle is that we are not to harm anyone.<br />
......<br />
The second Statute is that you have to stu ... stand on your own legs and know that you are here one with the Truth, the testimony. The testimony of the Truth: that you have seen the Truth, you know what Truth is, and you cannot compromise with falsehood, you cannot.<br />
......<br />
The third thing for a guru, in Sahaja Yoga has to do, is to develop detachment.<br />
......<br />
Now the fourth thing, the fourth Statute of the Lord is: 'To lead a moral life.' "<br />

"Today, it's a great day that you are here to worship your Guru in the realm of-f Hea... the Heart of the Universe. If we can do that in our domain of the heart, we don't have to do anything else.<br />
......<br />
That is how the Sahaja Yoga today is working out in all directions, if you find, to put all upside-down things into right direction, to expose it to reality, to bring all real values, to abolish all n... rotten value systems, all political, economic systems, all s-spiritual theologies, all psychological and all such nonsensical [some laughter] ideas into its proper direction.<br />
How in one In-a... Incarnation it has worked out. You can imagine: how in one Incarnation all these ideas s... have been put right.<br />
......<br />
Sahaja Yoga must grow within you. You should not be, anymore, regarded as immature Sahaja Yogis. I would say: a person who is a matured Sahaja Yogi is the one who can combine so many things together, with all beautiful lines, thin lines, thin maryādās maintained.<br />
But you cannot do the other way round!<br />
......<br />
So let us be in the center. We should be wealthy, but not too much. We should be healthy, but not too much. Uh we should be wise, but not too much. [Laughter, smiles.] 'So far, so good.'<br />
That's how we should move, so we keep to our maryādās, and we become beautiful Sahaja Yogis, who will be congenial to others, who'll be able to get others to... to us, who will be able to project an image of magnetic personalities. And this is what we have to do."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>You Are My publicity!</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"So, when you get your Realization, first and foremost thing you must know about your physical self, which is not known to you so far. As soon as you jump into the Unconscious, you have witnessed it: that you come to know about your physical being, first about your self. You come to know what is your physical problem, where are you suffering: automatically you know that this is what you are suffering from. You don't have to go to a doctor to ask him for what are you suffering from.<br />
......<br />
When you put your hands towards Me, you understand your position, first of all. You do not realize Me, but you realize your Self. Immediately you feel the burning, or you feel the cooling, or you feel the smarting, or tingling, or whatever it is, all that s not indicative of Me, but is all indicative of you. Then by the vibrations that are flowing through My being, they are corrected. All these problems are corrected. Then when your machine is corrected, then the same mach... machine that Myself emits the vibrations or you receive the vibrations which are really Me. But that to an extent ... to that extent, which you have achieved the clarity and the sensitivity.<br />
......<br />
Today is the day when a Mother is being worshiped as a Guru, and is a very unique thing. So far, mostly the gurus have been men.<br />
I too has [have] a Guru, and His name is Dattātreya. And this Guru is also created by Ādi Śhakti Herself. It's a very funny relationship that exists, because He is the father, He is the son, He is the brother: all the sublime relationships that can exist between a guru and a disciple who is a lady, who is a woman.<br />
......<br />
You will say: 'Mother, what can we do? After all, what are we?' That's a way of evading the issue.<br />
But if you really want to see, you can do a lot. And that is what it is that: you are My witness. You are My publicity!<br />
So, today you have to take some vows. And you have to say: that, 'We are going to do these things. We are going to talk about Sahaj Yog, we are going to propagate it, we are going to spread it. And what may come, we are going to surrender ourselves to Mother. Even, if She's supposing, scolds us, or says anything it is for our good. And we are not going to get confused.' And that's how you have to absolutely vow that you are going to dedicate yourself to Sahaj Yog to help others, to e... emancipate, and to create atmosphere for the completion of this universe, of this creation, for that fruitful day when we will say: that the Kingdom of God has been brought on this Earth.<br />
So today is not the day for Me to give, but for you. You have to announce."<br />
