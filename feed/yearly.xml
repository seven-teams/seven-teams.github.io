<font size="+2"><b>This Connection That You Have With Śhrī Mātājī Is The Only Connection That You Are Looking Out For</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Today, we are all going to worship Me, first time. It has been always the Pūjā of [an] aspect of Me or a part of Me.<br />
......<br />
So now, Ādi Śhakti had to assert, put the complete force-s-s.<br />
So, the first thing She realized, that one should know what is a family.<br />
......<br />
Under this circumstance, Sahaja Yoga started. And there I find: that, the Powers of Ādi Śhakti are much greater than the problems you see. I saw it very clearly Myself. Because these Powers are awakening the Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
......<br />
If you are not meditating, then I have no relationship with you.<br />
......<br />
In the beginning of course the meditation take some time. But once you will know what is meditation is, how you enjoy My company, how you are one with Me, how we can have a rapport with each other, there's no need to have anything else in between like writing letters or maybe some sort of a special connection, nothing of that kind. Only thing that is needed: is the meditation.<br />
In meditation you grow, in that spiritually you become higher.<br />
And when that happens, you start, in a way, I would say, that ... when you reach a state of that, I should say, maturity in Sahaja Yoga, then you don't want to give up your meditation. Because that time you are absolutely One with Me.<br /> 
......<br />
First it will be difficult, but after some time you will know that this connection that you have with Śhrī Mātājī is the only connection that you are looking out for."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>A Personality That Does Not React</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Something special has happened to you: that, the whole of Brahmachaitanya, the whole Ocean, has taken the form of a cloud, that's Ādi Śhakti, and has come on this Earth to shower the Chaitanya on you people, enrich you, nurture you, develop you, by manifesting the love in such a manner that you have entered into the body of the Ādi Śhakti.<br />
So like one pitcher which is in the River Ganges, you are like a cell in the body of the Ādi Śhakti. Your entity, your personality is preserved. Despite that, you feel the Brahmachaitanya through your senses, and you can give Realizations to others. But you are in the body of the Ādi Śhakti. As long as you are in the boy ... body of Ādi Śhakti, you can do all that.<br />
This is the greatest thing that has happened: the whole of the Sahasrāra has opened out with all the seven Pīṭhas of all the Deities, who were just part and parcel of it. The whole of it has come in the form of a Mother who is humble, who is [smiling:] deceptive, illusive, who is Mahāmāyā. Is the greatest thing that could happen to human beings and to the whole universe: that, now, you can get your Realization, you can give Realizations to others, you can understand through your senses, through your logic what is vibrations, what it does.<br />
......<br />
This aggressiveness has to go from your heart! It has to get out of it!<br />
There's no place in My body for aggressive people: no place at all. I have not aggressed you, and you shouldn't aggress Me. If you aggress any Sahaja Yogi, you are aggressing Me.<br />
......<br />
That's a very important part of S-s-sahasrāra, because ego covers a great part of Sahasrāra. And if your Sahasrāra is covered with this ego business, how can I help you and how can I help Myself?<br />
Now so many of you are in My body, just imagine, circulating fast, and most of them are fighting to be in My heart, but they are settling in My ego.<br />
Well, I am egoless! Because I have no reactions.<br />
If you have no reaction, you cannot develop ego.<br />
I've no reactions. I'm reactionless. I am in My own peace and glory, trying to work out Sahaja Yoga. I do not r-react to anything.<br />
But your reactions trouble Me, because you are within Me.<br />
......<br />
So, this kind of ... a crackness, or this-ss, what you call this-s-ss madness, aggressive madness, comes from ego going to the level of superego. And they go ... get, first of all, `What's wrong?'<br />
......<br />
So have that satisfaction and glory of your own being and of your own standard, and of your own caliber. The others are not of your caliber all right: forget about it.<br />
That should not give you ego, but should give you a personality that does not re-act! We have something of our own, we do not re-act to things! We are not reactionaries-s."<br />

"Not easy to understand Sahaj Yog, very difficult.<br />
To understand Me is even worse. [Laughter.] Because, you know, I'm Mahāmāyā.<br />
......<br />
So, tomorrow I'm going to tell you something which you have take ... you have to take with a very receptive mind. Ah, something very special. But you have to have a very receptive mind. If you are very conditioned, or your ego is there, which may be difficult.<br />
But Truth has to be told sometime. And i... if Truth is not accepted, it will express itself, but it will destroy many things. So best thing is to accept the Truth as it is.<br />
Accept it. Put it in your heart. Is a fact.<br />

"Now be confident that you have powers. And this is the new change that is going to come within your own understanding.<br />
So far only you knew that you could feel the vibrations, that you could cure people -- you could help to cure, I mean still not so confident -- that ... uh ... you could feel the Paramachaitanya.<br />
But you did not know what Dynamic Forces are working in you now. And this is the new change that is going to come.<br />
With this new change, you have to assume a new character. And the new character is announcement.<br />
So far I had told you not to talk about Sahaja Yoga very openly, blatantly, but now the time has come. We waited long for these days. Now you have to all start talking about it, announcing about it and telling about it to everyone. Otherwise, the world would say that, 'We never knew about it.'<br />
......<br />
You have to understand that all these powers are bubbling in you. And just out of formality or maybe out of shyness or maybe little cowardice, you are hiding them.<br />
......<br />
So now you are in the Royal Court: take up your responsibilities. Everybody has to feel responsible. And assume what you are.<br />
......<br />
This is the New Era we are starting from today. And this is the day I was waiting for all of you to realize that you are not Sahaja Yogis for only your selfish ends, nor for your families, nor for your communities, nor for your country, but for the whole world. Expand yourself. You must have that vision before you -- that I have put many a times before you people -- that you have to emancipate the humanity.<br />
......<br />
Today we have here people from all over the world, and you go and tell this message to all the rest of the people, whom I have not met, that, 'Mother has already announced, through the Viṣhṇumāyā also [smiles], that you all have become now Mahāyogis.' 
......<br />
Now, for you, it is important to see that you have something so unique with you. But only thing what you need is a courage and a complete commitment to go forward with this propagation of Sahaja Yoga, announcement of Sahaja Yoga."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>Sincerity Itself Is Rewarding</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Now, today is the day to make a big determination that you will start enjoying your Collective Spirit. Everything for the collectivity. Then the enjoyment will be maximum. You will never feel that you have sacrificed anything.<br />
......<br />
So, you must make a determination not to lea... bring Sahaja Yoga to your personal level, or to your limited problems, or to your own relationships. It is the relationship of the Creation with God. Is not your relationship of anybody else's relationship. As in any machine, all the wires must be connected to the mains through one main wire, in the same way you all must be connected to God individually so that you all are connected among yourself. I've been saying this again and again and again because, at Sahasrāra, you are being blessed of this Collective Spirit.<br />
The second very important point is of complete integration within and without.<br />
......<br />
And it comes: first of all is sincerity. First of all is complete sincerity.
......<br />
So you try to feel it from your heart: that's what it means sincerity. Do not depend on anyone: your wife, husband, children, nothing, mother, father. It's your own!<br />
So, you have to work in such a way that you get complete integration. And the driving force towards integration is a very simple one: is sincerity. Thus, you will know that automatically you are getting integrated.<br />
......<br />
And then sincerity itself is rewarding. This principle must be written down in your hearts: that sincerity itself is rewarding. You don't have to go to anybody else to ask first the reward of sincerity, sincerity itself rewards you. And that's why you start enjoying your own sincerity.<br />
......<br />
Try to become sincere and sincere and sincere and enjoy your sincerity.<br />
I bless you all with your sincerity."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>Greatest Weapon Of All</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"And in the Vaikuṇṭha Stage it is described very clearly how Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa Himself came to bless Him and told Him, that, "You will be placed even higher than Me, because Your body will be made out of Chaitanya."<br />
Chaitanya, what is the English word for Chaitanya?<br /> 
......<br />
Divine Awareness! Of the Divine Awareness. You can say is the Divine Awareness Itself, is the Divine Vibrations are shown in us.<br />
In the same way, He's made out of that like the ... like Śhrī Gaṇeśha is.<br />
Now if He's so or not, because most of you are Indians here, you might challenge it. You may. I can prove it to you. Because is the same Swastika. The āyudhas or the weapons of Śhrī Gaṇeśha have become avyakta, are not expressed. Because He used one weapon for all of them: is of forgiveness.<br />
And that is the Greatest Weapon of all, and that's why, at this stage when the Kuṇḍalinī goes, you have to take His name or you have to forgive people.<br />
Forgiveness is the Greatest Weapon that God has given us.<br />
Now it is for you to verify whether I say it is correct or not.<br />
But crucifixion is not the Message.<br />
Crucifixion is the explanation of what Kṛiṣhṇa preached, that the Chaitanya, the Divine Awareness, does not vanish, does not. It is akṣhara, it does not get killed. You cannot control it. And this was to be proved in His life through His Resurrection.<br />
The Resurrection is the Message of Christ.<br />
But as in India, you have done all the mess of all these Incarnations, they have done the mess of Christ, in two ways.<br />
One, by not respecting the celibacy of life. He was a celibate person. He was a holy person! Of course He respected the marriage institution because He attended the marriage. You have crucified Him again.<br />
And secondly, which is His Power of Forgiveness, Complete Power of Forgiveness.<br />
But they had empires! They now want to have e-conomic, what you call the economic controlling power, and all kinds of these things they are doing under the name of political, I don't know what they call it.<br />
They have to be Christians.<br />
All that was against Him is done now today, as the Indians have done all that what was against Hinduism."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>Nothing But Love And Compassion And The Message Of Breaking The Sahasrāra</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"The Resurrection of Christ is very symbolic for Sahaja Yoga. If Christ could be resurrected, then the human beings also can be resurrected, because He came as a human being with all powers and He created the Path of Resurrection for us. This Path of Resurrection is the one that we have followed in Sahaja Yoga.<br />
......<br />
What does a human being need is nothing but love and compassion: love and compassion of a very, very pure type.<br />
Look at Christ: He pitied the people who crucified Him. He told His Father, the God Almighty, that, "Please forgive them, because they don't know what they are doing." He could see that the blindness of these people are doing wrong things and God the Father will be very annoyed, who is wrathful, and may destroy them. So, this is what uh it was done with a very compassionate feeling. Without thinking about, just automatically, He felt that, 'These people are doing all this to Me and I don't know what will happen to them.' So, He prayed to God, to Father: "Please forgive. Please forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing, they are blind. So please do not punish them."<br />
What compassion! What love! I mean, think of it: kuh do we do that in our life if somebody harms us, troubles us? Do we ask Father to forgive those who do not know what they are doing? That should be the level of Sahaj Yog. And it will work out very well if you ask for forgiveness, God will look after them, He'll transform them, He'll bring them to their senses.<br />
......<br />
Is the Christ within you has to arise, Christ within you has to guide, it is Christ within you who will teach you how to behave towards others and how to gain their confidence, and give them the love and peace, that you have now flowing within you, to make them very, very happy and joyous people. This is the Message of Resurrection, this is the Message of breaking the Sahasrāra."<br />

"When I say Sahaj Yog, you know that is the Yoga of your attention with My Feet. That's what it is.<br />
But if you are still moving with your egos, and if you are still thinking on those lines, that: 'We are something and the we can start our own Sahaj Yog. We can work out this way and that way,' or, 'My wife is like that,' 'My child is like that,' 'My husband is like that.'<br />
You have to give up all these problems, on one side! Otherwise, you will not ascend.<br />

My attention is always on your Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
You cannot play tricks in Sahaja Yoga, take it from Me. Anybody who tries to play any trick will be very badly punished. So please be very, very careful not to be dishonest, and not to play tricks in Sahaja Yoga. <br />

But whatever you are doing, keep attention in your connection."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>We Have Started The Great Religion</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Of course, the bhakti does give that purity, but if there is anything lingering in your mind, I have to tell you that there are three things that are going to happen from today.<br />
First, we have started Vishwa Nirmala Dharma. You are under the vision of Śhrī Gaṇeśh, under the guidance of your Spirit, and under the blessings of God Almighty. But be careful, because once you become that, you have to keep to that Dharma, you have to be honest about it. If you are dishonest from today onwards, you be careful, anything can happen to you if you get out of the maryādās. Till you keep to the Maryādās of Sahaja Yoga, saying morning, evening, night that, 'I am a Sahaja Yogi,' nobody can har ... hurt, nobody can trouble you. On the contrary you will be enjoying life if you keep to the maryādās. But if you leave the Maryādās of Sahaja Yoga, you will have big problems.<br />
So this is the second thing I want to tell you: that today we have started the Great Religion, which was promised long time back, of realized Souls.<br />
Now the third thing is that with all these things we are doing, we must promise to God also that, 'We will know about Sahaja Yoga through proper understanding, reading every word of it, we'll master the knowledge of Sahaj Yog, we'll keep ourselves clean, and completely surrender our lives to Sahaja Yoga.' This is what you have to promise in your heart. Surrendering to Sahaja Yoga is actually surrendering to joy, bliss and peace. In that you are the gainer, nobody is a loser in it. This is how today we have to decide once for all."<br />

"Firstly, you must see for yourself what is Sahaja Yoga, what it has given you. It has given you Realization, it has given you that wider vision, it has given you Collective Consciousness, it has given you thoughtless awareness and doubtless awareness. It has made a new personality out of you, like an egg becoming a bird.<br />

But the best part of it: that I don't need Sahaj Yog, and that Sahaja Yoga does not need you. You need Sahaja Yoga.<br />
In itself, Sahaja Yoga is complete. It does not need you. It is a complete thing, will remain like that, absolutely. It will have its own position, its own status, its own dignity, everything intact.<br />
But if you have to get something out of it, you have to work it out."<br />
