<font size="+2"><b>Leadership Means That You Should Be Able To Execute Sahaja Yoga Principles In Others</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"In your lives, if people will see that you are very peaceful, good, helpful, collective people, then only Sahaja Yoga will spread. Not what I am saying, or what I am spreading, or what I am working out. It's a fact! That I always had a feeling that Sahaja Yogis should take to social work.<br />
.......<br />
And so I would request you, all of you, to be little generous. The generosity should be towards social side of our world, which is very important to be attended to.<br />
I hope you will understand that I have not changed the way. It's the path which is going now in a smooth way. We had to first climbing a very hazardous [laughing:] mountain, and now we have come to a place where we understand.<br />
......<br />
It will be very kind of you to understand that all these problems can be solved by you, I don't have to be there. I am there with you all the time, I am one with you all the time, so there is no need for you to come to Me for all these things which are absolutely under your control.<br />
If not, you give up your leadership, so-called. Because leadership means that you should be able to execute Sahaja Yoga Principles in others, and work it out.<br />
.......<br />
You have to absorb, absorb vibrations.<br />
You have come here to get vibrations, to get more and more of that, and not to wile away your time talking this, that. No! You have come here to grow!"<br />

<b>Sahaj Yogi:</b> Mhh!<br />

You have to be an Indian to understand that.<br />
<b>Sahaj Yogi:</b> I think he will understand.<br />
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> There are certain things described, about Śhrī Mātājī.<br />
If you have read any books, of Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, or of Mārkaṇḍeya Himself, then you will know.<br />
And the qualities described there, of such a person, if they find it in someone, they call that person by that name. Isn't it?<br />
Like M... Gāndhījī was called as Mahātmā Gāndhī. Mahātmā means a 'Bigger Spirit' than others. Because he had that! He didn't care for himself, for his own family, for him's ... uh everything for his own, but he thought of the whole country. That's why he was called Mahātmā!<br />

"See, look at Mahātmā Gāndhī, how he looked like. I don't know. I have seen him, I've lived with him in My childhood. Such a bony structure, but even uh Samson would have been afraid of him, he was like that! [Some laughtert.] Such a Power of Truth and Honesty in his heart. Is not that his face was very impressive, but the inner power which was within him.<br />
I know of another Prime Minister very well, Lal Bahadur Shastri. I'm talking about him because both were born on the same date of second of October. Another person, tremendously powerful, very short man! So powerful he was! And his Realization of such a high degree! He could easily make out who is who.<br /> 
Of course, he respected Me very much. I used to be very shy, because he would not even sit before Me on the chair. Is what we call Self-realization."<br />

<font size="+2"><b></b>The Spirit Tells You What Is The Truth<br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"These two have to meet. They are separated. The Spirit within you, and the Holy Ghost within you, have to meet. That is the Yoga, that's the Union.<br />
......<br />
The Spirit Itself is Sat-chit-ānanda. He e... exists in the State of Truth.<br />
Now, we do not know what Truth is. People say, 'God is Love, God is Truth.' Now what is the Truth? <br />
The Truth is this All-pervading Power. And this All-pervading Power is the nature of the Spirit, which gives you the Absolute Knowledge. Now mark it: Absolute Knowledge.<br />
......<br />
So the first thing you are: you are the Truth! The Spirit tells you what is the Truth. It tells you everything about everything. It is the Truth! The Knowledge that is pure is the Truth!  
......<br />
So the Truth is: everything is illusion, except for the Divine Love of God that is all-pervading, which you can feel through your Spirit.<br />
This power has got telecommunication, It has got all that you have created in the science, It can coordinate and cooperates. It has got all the angels and all the great Souls to help It, and to look after you. And the top, topping the whole thing, is the quality that It loves! It loves you.<br />
So It doesn't come to you like a sword. It gives you the time to improve, to judge yourself, to rise, to grow, just as a mother would look after her child, forgive mistakes, see that the child rises, and grows into complete manhood.<br />
So it is Love! And the love that is so powerful is the Truth. And it never fails. It never fails.<br />
......<br />
The second thing: the nature of Spirit is that He's Chitta, He's the attention. He's the attention means: when you become spiritually enlightened, your attention becomes enlightened.<br />
......<br />
Then the third thing happens: is the [laughing:] joy! That you are in joy all the time. You cannot keep serious for more than two minutes. Is very difficult to keep serious.<br /> 
......<br />
May God bless you to blossom into the beauties of your Spirit, so that you glorify your Father, and He feels glorified with His Gracious Love towards you."<br />

<b>Objectives:</b><br />
13. To employ the energy of love to overcome hatred that is the cause of wars, disintegration and destruction by publishing and relating the spiritual experiences of Sadhakas which prove the universal laws of love.<br />
20. To counteract through mass spiritual power the destructive forces against spiritualism such as evil spirits, the cult of hypnotism, siddhis and the use of "religion" for the exploitation of the innocent.<br />

<p>
"But ah this shows that we should understand Sahaja Yoga, that unless and until we are quiet, unless and until we are in thoughtless awareness, we cannot grow. So, all these extreme behaviors cannot take you to the center.<br />
......<br />
But, you see, marriage is a uh-uh-uh thing for Indians, is that is uh-uh, just like having a baby in the house, you see, just like that. It's a part and parcel. So, they never think that, 'All right, my wife has come, she's short or she's uh fair or dark,' nothing, 'Now she's my wife.' Like your child. Like your child comes in, that's it. So, the ... this is what it is a marriage: this is a wife who has come, the husband is there. Husband is supposed to be a husband, wife is supposed to be a wife, finished. That's a part of the family, we all live together. And the-uh husband is supposed to protect the wife, and the wife is supposed to look after the husband and all the family people and everyone.<br />
......<br />
Is a, once you're married, just accept this is the part of your life, is from your destiny, it's your life ... uh previous lives' things, is just accept the fact. Work it out.<br />
And we don't even work out marriages, they just work out.<br />
......<br />
But, you see, in Sahaja Yoga you become actually the person who is a Vaiṣhṇava, is the one who is in the center. Viṣhṇu's Path: you are neither left nor right. You're on Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's Path.<br />
So, how can you remain left or right? If you are left or right then you are no more [in] Sahaj Yog.<br />
......<br />
And actually in Sahaja Yoga nobody should be right-sided or left-sided. You are all in the center. You are all in the center. Because certain things like shoe-beating is such an embarrassing things, you know, but you have to [laughing:] do it, you can't help it if you have ego.<br />
......<br />
So, tomorrow I'm going to talk about the Master of Masters [Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa], whom I can master also. I can master that Master also. All right?"<br />

"Mahātmā Gāndhī says that ahiṃsā, i.e., nonviolence is the only way we can get rid of war. It is true that Indians fought the British with nonviolent methods to achieve their freedom. But nonviolent methods to gain freedom may sometimes result in the sacrifice of great lives for the country, when the ruling power uses brutal methods. This is what happened in India in several instances. Fortunately by Divine Blessing a Labour Government came into power in the United Kingdom immediately after the end of the Second World War. This Government initiated a process voluntarily which resulted in India's independence. Unfortunately, not all countries have the same good luck. There are numerous instances of dependent countries having to sacrifice a great many precious lives to gain freedom."<br />

"For example today I saw the flag, Independence: when we got [it] we made this flag. I'd seen this flagned [flag] being brought down, and put up when the other flag was brought down [in August 1947]. I cannot tell you what was the feeling that governed Me. Such a feeling, that the Truth has, some or other, overcome the untruth. That justice has been shown over the injustice. That feeling is still so much, I can't even see the flag. If I see it, I remember the whole history, the whole thing: how many people sacrificed, how many martyrs there were, how much people have fought for it, that flag stands for that.<br />
And you stand for all that. You stand for all those ideals, you stand for all those sacrifices, and you stand for all that is to be achieved for bettering human beings.<br />
You have to achieve a great deal for others. You have to work, within yourself, what you can do for others, what you can achieve for others, what is the best way to imbibe those qualities within yeall [you] that you become a[n] absolutely unique personality."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>Mother Make Me Such That I Suck More Of The Divine</b><br /></font>
</p>

"So you should not make them attend any Pūjā, minimum, and also seminars I would say. Because seminars are meant for people who are intensively in Sahaja Yoga, to inse ... intensify their awareness, you see, not for people who are half-baked, who are Doubting Thomases, all these kind of people are absolutely useless, you should never bring them to seminar. Whether it's your son, father, brother, mother, sister, husband, wife, nothing doing. You shouldn't bring anybody who is not fully awakened Sahaj Yogi, because seminars are meant for very intensive work.<br />
And what I find, always these people will argue with Me, they are the first to question, they have something to say, [laughing:] they are the ones! [Laughing:] Sahaja Yogis are keeping quiet and receive it. I don't mind even that, but what happens in the seminar, you have to receive more. And they do not receive, their attention is outside, they are disturbing everyone.<br />
So, seminars are even, in a way, more important than an Āśhram, because in Āśhram there's no other problem but to fight them out. But here, in a new place we go, we have to fight out's all surroundings, the place itself has to be cleansed, everything has to be done. On top of that you have these terrible people around you, whom you have to convince. If they are not convinced, why are they here? Why did they spend so much money to come down? Be sure, they have come here to disturb us.<br />
......<br />
So that is for the people who have to have the privilege of this worship. Today is specially a great privilege because it was not so planned, but it worked out, just worked out.<br />
......<br />
So, sucking should be more. Sucking should be more. And just before the Pūjā you should say: `Mother, make me such that I suck more of the Divine!' Just pray that, with sincerity from your heart, just say that. [Twelve seconds of silence.]"<br />

<font size="+2"><b>Have I Become My Own Guru?</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"In Sahaja Yoga, the Guru Pūjā has a very different significant [significance] from any other guru pūjā. When you worship your Guru, you are also worshiping the Guru within you. This is not in any other guru-disciple system, because, in you, the Guru, the Master, has been awakened. And so, when you are worshiping your Guru, then this Master within you is also worshiped, you respect it, you glorify it, you awaken it, and you manifest it.<br />
This, we have to realize: that, in Sahaja Yoga, if you are a Sahaja Yogi.<br />
Now the quality of guru, first and foremost is: that he makes you meet God. Means: he raises the Kuṇḍalinī, and establish the relation between the All-pervading Power.<br />
And, as your Guru is Ādi Śhakti, you make that person meet, also, the Ādi Śhakti.<br />
So you have a double advantage. That, at the same time, when you give them Realization, not only that you make them feel the Union with the Divine Power, but you can make them meet the Divinity Itself, the Source of Divine Power.<br />
So your responsibility as Sahaja Yogis is very great because in you is ... there is the Guru.<br />
Now we in our mantras we say that: 'Mother, I am my own guru.' But, saying that, do we realize, that, "If I am ah ... my own guru, this 'I' and 'my guru', between the two, what have I achieved? Where am I? Can I guide myself? Have I got the light of the Spirit on my attention, so well established and manifested, that I can guide myself and guide others later on?"<br />
First of all, the ... in the Guru Principle it is important, that you see to yourself the introspection: 'Can I be my own guru? Have I become my own guru?'<br />
......<br />
First of all, the quality of a person who has dharma is: that he listens to others, he obeys.<br />
......<br />
The basic thing is humility.<br />
......<br />
Now, for a Guru, as you have seen, that, in My own ... own way, in My own image, you have to come up.<br />
First of all, your life should be absolutely transparent. Transparency is the essence of Sahaja Yoga.<br />
......<br />
So the food part of it is āswāda. You should not have any taste for any special food.<br />
......<br />
So, the eating of good food is a kind of a[n] addiction. It's a kind of an addiction, it's something like drug: that you must have good food.<br />
......<br />
So this is the second point is that: we have to uh-uh-uh give up body k... comfort.<br />
But the third point where I think the Western people falter is uh their materialistic attitude. Materialistic attitude and their fondness of their eyes.<br />
......<br /> 
So this madness of antique has to go away from our minds."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>The Right Side Movement Is The Collectivity</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Today is a great day, for all of us, because we are celebrating the Guru Pūjā and remembering all the Great Gurus who came on Earth to teach the world about the Truth. So many of Them were here. And They tried Their level best to explain to humanity what is spirituality.<br />
But is such a disparity that people never understood that spirituality is the most important thing we need, that we have to be one with the Divine Power.<br />
......<br />
That means: Sahaja Yogis can also become right-sided, but like Christ. Otherwise, if they are right-sided: they'll organize, they'll do all kinds of things and have problems of the right side. That's why I want you to avoid the right side.<br />
But once you are fully a left-sided master of Sahaja Yoga, then it's very-very much needed to be a Complete Personality of Spirituality, that you should take to right side movement. And what is the right side movement? Is the collectivity.<br />
......<br />
So, talk about this to everyone, bring them to Sahaja Yoga.<br />
Is a very important day, because, as a Guru Pūjā, they say that a guru canno-t give anything to you. But I can give you the advice, and the advice that you enlarge your heart, you become humble, and try to spread Sahaja Yoga with humility, not with aggressiveness. That is extremely important!<br />
If you can do that, then you'll do full justice to this-s life, which is a spiritual life. Without that you cannot achieve, you cannot achieve, the strength of spirituality. For that, you have to understand that it's very-very important that you should give Sahaja Yoga a full chance, through your wisdom."<br />

......<br />
And specially in the West, you see, ah with this a woman's lib and all these nonsensical ideas have gone into the heads of even Sahaja Yogis. One of the conditionings they have.<br />
......<br />
Now, in Sahaja Yoga, nobody can dominate you. Because you are the Spirit, and the Spirit cannot be dominated. If you think you are dominated, then know that you are not a Spirit.<br />
So, now, we have to understand: we are women in Sahaja Yoga. And we have to understand our balancing power.<br />
......<br />
But one should be very proud that you are women. I am very proud that I am a woman. Because women can perform so many things which men cannot do. <br />
......<br />
Same, women in Sahaja Yoga are very important for Me. But the first thing they should have is a bearing power.<br />
......<br />
And also they should have lots and lots of love and compassion.<br />
......<br />
The Absolute Womanhood is the climax for you.<br />
......<br />
Love is the best way to control anyone. But love means sacrifice. But after some time you won't feel any sacrifice. Once you start enjoying, giving, then it is no more a sacrifice.<br />
......<br />
Women ha... have been given so many qualities, because their lifestyle is more difficult than that of men.<br />
So, I have to make one request to you: that you must try to make yourself uh-uh into a proper Sahaja Yoginī.<br />
......<br />
No, men are more intelligent, no doubt. But women have intuition. But you don't have to argue! It will happen, the way you have intuition will happen, and they will learn a lesson.<br />
......<br />
So, you see, they ... they ... special quality which is intuition must be developed. All right?<br />
Now see the difference, because you are deep, you are much deeper. In evolution you are higher, no doubt."<br />
