"But if you stay in the center, that's the fourth side: is staying in the center. Turīya: is uhs ... sfourth ... fourth dimension. If you could stay on that, then you become a witness. And that's the point where you start sucking the joy of every moment. Every moment: of every doing, of every work, of every friendship, of every relationship, of every understanding.<br />
......<br />
So we have to give up our misidentifications with our previous styles of life, pre... previous types of living, previous type of executing any work. And we have to understand that we are not to plan. This house is built for Me. I'm the Power [laughing:] behind the whole universe, so, you don't have to plan. You just start off. 
......<br />
So, once you understand that we are not to worry about these things, which the people worry. We are not to worry about things which ... for which people just uh give their lives.<br />
We are here for joy! And joy will come to us, whatever it is! So we should seek joy, happiness, friendship.<br />
.......<br />
So the more you are in collectivity and in the blessing state, the better it could be always for you, in your other life, other thing also.<br />
......<br />
And so you all have to prepare yourself: talk about it. So there should be no more silence. There should be no more silence.<br />
......<br />
You must speak, you must talk about it. You must give Realization. Move your hands, move your legs. You have to walk across. For God's work, even if you have to beg you have to do that. This is God's work. Our has to do that, God's work, with all dedication, with all surrendering, and with all love and enjoyment."<br />

<b>Objectives:</b><br />
2. To achieve the evolution described in the foregoing para through the method of ``Sahaja Yoga" which means effortless, easy, relaxed method of meditation evolved by Mātājī. To organize meditation centers for this purpose. This completely precludes all the external human efforts like rituals, worships, prayers, recitations, reading, renunciation (i.e. saṃnyāsa), worship of the preceptor (Guru) or any other physical expressions.<br />
5. To introduce the only one internal living religion lying dead and camouflaged under external practices and precepts of religion in all the human beings and for this to organize tours and hold spiritual meetings as per wishes of Mātājī.<br />
22. To open, organize and run local centers of the Life Eternal Institution in various parts of India and in foreign countries, the centers being opened on the distinct understanding that meditation is the path of the entire human destiny, and that all barriers of states, nations and races are artificial and irrelevant to Life Eternal.<br />

"Among comes to the Realization, that forgiveness is the most powerful way of cleansing the spiritual being.<br />
......<br />
When I read Him, I am amazed at His s-s-sense of humor: how He openly comes out with such remarks. I feel He is like Mārkaṇḍeya in India, or Kabīr Dās in India, who slashed the whole society with their sword all the time to see that they are brought to the proper shape, without fear. But so gentle. If you read the song of the `[Book of] Thel' [by Śhrī William Blake], is so gentle.<br />
And all of them, who were Him perhaps or are of the same style, [were] extremely open, straightforward, you can say even blatant and extremely gentle."<br />

5. To introduce the only one internal living religion lying dead and camouflaged under external practices and precepts of religion in all the human beings and for this to organize tours and hold spiritual meetings as per wishes of Mātājī.<br />
13. To employ the energy of love to overcome hatred that is the cause of wars, disintegration and destruction by publishing and relating the spiritual experiences of Sadhakas which prove the universal laws of love.<br />

<p>
"In your lives, if people will see that you are very peaceful, good, helpful, collective people, then only Sahaja Yoga will spread. Not what I am saying, or what I am spreading, or what I am working out. It's a fact! That I always had a feeling that Sahaja Yogis should take to social work.<br />
.......<br />
And so I would request you, all of you, to be little generous. The generosity should be towards social side of our world, which is very important to be attended to.<br />
I hope you will understand that I have not changed the way. It's the path which is going now in a smooth way. We had to first climbing a very hazardous [laughing:] mountain, and now we have come to a place where we understand.<br />
......<br />
It will be very kind of you to understand that all these problems can be solved by you, I don't have to be there. I am there with you all the time, I am one with you all the time, so there is no need for you to come to Me for all these things which are absolutely under your control.<br />
If not, you give up your leadership, so-called. Because leadership means that you should be able to execute Sahaja Yoga Principles in others, and work it out.<br />
.......<br />
You have to absorb, absorb vibrations.<br />
You have come here to get vibrations, to get more and more of that, and not to wile away your time talking this, that. No! You have come here to grow!"<br />

If you have read any books, of Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, or of Mārkaṇḍeya Himself, then you will know.<br />
And the qualities described there, of such a person, if they find it in someone, they call that person by that name. Isn't it?<br />
Like M... Gāndhījī was called as Mahātmā Gāndhī. Mahātmā means a 'Bigger Spirit' than others. Because he had that! He didn't care for himself, for his own family, for him's ... uh everything for his own, but he thought of the whole country. That's why he was called Mahātmā!<br />

"See, look at Mahātmā Gāndhī, how he looked like. I don't know. I have seen him, I've lived with him in My childhood. Such a bony structure, but even uh Samson would have been afraid of him, he was like that! [Some laughtert.] Such a Power of Truth and Honesty in his heart. Is not that his face was very impressive, but the inner power which was within him.<br />
I know of another Prime Minister very well, Lal Bahadur Shastri. I'm talking about him because both were born on the same date of second of October. Another person, tremendously powerful, very short man! So powerful he was! And his Realization of such a high degree! He could easily make out who is who.<br /> 
Of course, he respected Me very much. I used to be very shy, because he would not even sit before Me on the chair. Is what we call Self-realization."<br />

<font size="+2"><b></b>The Spirit Tells You What Is The Truth<br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"These two have to meet. They are separated. The Spirit within you, and the Holy Ghost within you, have to meet. That is the Yoga, that's the Union.<br />
......<br />
The Spirit Itself is Sat-chit-ānanda. He e... exists in the State of Truth.<br />
Now, we do not know what Truth is. People say, 'God is Love, God is Truth.' Now what is the Truth? <br />
The Truth is this All-pervading Power. And this All-pervading Power is the nature of the Spirit, which gives you the Absolute Knowledge. Now mark it: Absolute Knowledge.<br />
......<br />
So the first thing you are: you are the Truth! The Spirit tells you what is the Truth. It tells you everything about everything. It is the Truth! The Knowledge that is pure is the Truth!  
......<br />
So the Truth is: everything is illusion, except for the Divine Love of God that is all-pervading, which you can feel through your Spirit.<br />
This power has got telecommunication, It has got all that you have created in the science, It can coordinate and cooperates. It has got all the angels and all the great Souls to help It, and to look after you. And the top, topping the whole thing, is the quality that It loves! It loves you.<br />
So It doesn't come to you like a sword. It gives you the time to improve, to judge yourself, to rise, to grow, just as a mother would look after her child, forgive mistakes, see that the child rises, and grows into complete manhood.<br />
So it is Love! And the love that is so powerful is the Truth. And it never fails. It never fails.<br />
......<br />
The second thing: the nature of Spirit is that He's Chitta, He's the attention. He's the attention means: when you become spiritually enlightened, your attention becomes enlightened.<br />
......<br />

<p>
"But ah this shows that we should understand Sahaja Yoga, that unless and until we are quiet, unless and until we are in thoughtless awareness, we cannot grow. So, all these extreme behaviors cannot take you to the center.<br />
......<br />
But, you see, marriage is a uh-uh-uh thing for Indians, is that is uh-uh, just like having a baby in the house, you see, just like that. It's a part and parcel. So, they never think that, 'All right, my wife has come, she's short or she's uh fair or dark,' nothing, 'Now she's my wife.' Like your child. Like your child comes in, that's it. So, the ... this is what it is a marriage: this is a wife who has come, the husband is there. Husband is supposed to be a husband, wife is supposed to be a wife, finished. That's a part of the family, we all live together. And the-uh husband is supposed to protect the wife, and the wife is supposed to look after the husband and all the family people and everyone.<br />
......<br />
Is a, once you're married, just accept this is the part of your life, is from your destiny, it's your life ... uh previous lives' things, is just accept the fact. Work it out.<br />
And we don't even work out marriages, they just work out.<br />
......<br />
But, you see, in Sahaja Yoga you become actually the person who is a Vaiṣhṇava, is the one who is in the center. Viṣhṇu's Path: you are neither left nor right. You're on Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's Path.<br />
So, how can you remain left or right? If you are left or right then you are no more [in] Sahaj Yog.<br />
......<br />
And actually in Sahaja Yoga nobody should be right-sided or left-sided. You are all in the center. You are all in the center. Because certain things like shoe-beating is such an embarrassing things, you know, but you have to [laughing:] do it, you can't help it if you have ego.<br />
......<br />
So, tomorrow I'm going to talk about the Master of Masters [Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa], whom I can master also. I can master that Master also. All right?"<br />

"Mahātmā Gāndhī says that ahiṃsā, i.e., nonviolence is the only way we can get rid of war. It is true that Indians fought the British with nonviolent methods to achieve their freedom. But nonviolent methods to gain freedom may sometimes result in the sacrifice of great lives for the country, when the ruling power uses brutal methods. This is what happened in India in several instances. Fortunately by Divine Blessing a Labour Government came into power in the United Kingdom immediately after the end of the Second World War. This Government initiated a process voluntarily which resulted in India's independence. Unfortunately, not all countries have the same good luck. There are numerous instances of dependent countries having to sacrifice a great many precious lives to gain freedom."<br />

"For example today I saw the flag, Independence: when we got [it] we made this flag. I'd seen this flagned [flag] being brought down, and put up when the other flag was brought down [in August 1947]. I cannot tell you what was the feeling that governed Me. Such a feeling, that the Truth has, some or other, overcome the untruth. That justice has been shown over the injustice. That feeling is still so much, I can't even see the flag. If I see it, I remember the whole history, the whole thing: how many people sacrificed, how many martyrs there were, how much people have fought for it, that flag stands for that.<br />
And you stand for all that. You stand for all those ideals, you stand for all those sacrifices, and you stand for all that is to be achieved for bettering human beings.<br />
You have to achieve a great deal for others. You have to work, within yourself, what you can do for others, what you can achieve for others, what is the best way to imbibe those qualities within yeall [you] that you become a[n] absolutely unique personality."<br />

"So you should not make them attend any Pūjā, minimum, and also seminars I would say. Because seminars are meant for people who are intensively in Sahaja Yoga, to inse ... intensify their awareness, you see, not for people who are half-baked, who are Doubting Thomases, all these kind of people are absolutely useless, you should never bring them to seminar. Whether it's your son, father, brother, mother, sister, husband, wife, nothing doing. You shouldn't bring anybody who is not fully awakened Sahaj Yogi, because seminars are meant for very intensive work.<br />
And what I find, always these people will argue with Me, they are the first to question, they have something to say, [laughing:] they are the ones! [Laughing:] Sahaja Yogis are keeping quiet and receive it. I don't mind even that, but what happens in the seminar, you have to receive more. And they do not receive, their attention is outside, they are disturbing everyone.<br />
So, seminars are even, in a way, more important than an Āśhram, because in Āśhram there's no other problem but to fight them out. But here, in a new place we go, we have to fight out's all surroundings, the place itself has to be cleansed, everything has to be done. On top of that you have these terrible people around you, whom you have to convince. If they are not convinced, why are they here? Why did they spend so much money to come down? Be sure, they have come here to disturb us.<br />
......<br />
So that is for the people who have to have the privilege of this worship. Today is specially a great privilege because it was not so planned, but it worked out, just worked out.<br />
......<br />
So, sucking should be more. Sucking should be more. And just before the Pūjā you should say: `Mother, make me such that I suck more of the Divine!' Just pray that, with sincerity from your heart, just say that. [Twelve seconds of silence.]"<br />

"In Sahaja Yoga, the Guru Pūjā has a very different significant [significance] from any other guru pūjā. When you worship your Guru, you are also worshiping the Guru within you. This is not in any other guru-disciple system, because, in you, the Guru, the Master, has been awakened. And so, when you are worshiping your Guru, then this Master within you is also worshiped, you respect it, you glorify it, you awaken it, and you manifest it.<br />
This, we have to realize: that, in Sahaja Yoga, if you are a Sahaja Yogi.<br />
Now the quality of guru, first and foremost is: that he makes you meet God. Means: he raises the Kuṇḍalinī, and establish the relation between the All-pervading Power.<br />
And, as your Guru is Ādi Śhakti, you make that person meet, also, the Ādi Śhakti.<br />
So you have a double advantage. That, at the same time, when you give them Realization, not only that you make them feel the Union with the Divine Power, but you can make them meet the Divinity Itself, the Source of Divine Power.<br />
So your responsibility as Sahaja Yogis is very great because in you is ... there is the Guru.<br />
Now we in our mantras we say that: 'Mother, I am my own guru.' But, saying that, do we realize, that, "If I am ah ... my own guru, this 'I' and 'my guru', between the two, what have I achieved? Where am I? Can I guide myself? Have I got the light of the Spirit on my attention, so well established and manifested, that I can guide myself and guide others later on?"<br />
First of all, the ... in the Guru Principle it is important, that you see to yourself the introspection: 'Can I be my own guru? Have I become my own guru?'<br />
......<br />
First of all, the quality of a person who has dharma is: that he listens to others, he obeys.<br />
......<br />
The basic thing is humility.<br />
......<br />
Now, for a Guru, as you have seen, that, in My own ... own way, in My own image, you have to come up.<br />
First of all, your life should be absolutely transparent. Transparency is the essence of Sahaja Yoga.<br />
......<br />
So the food part of it is āswāda. You should not have any taste for any special food.<br />
......<br />
So, the eating of good food is a kind of a[n] addiction. It's a kind of an addiction, it's something like drug: that you must have good food.<br />
......<br />
So this is the second point is that: we have to uh-uh-uh give up body k... comfort.<br />
But the third point where I think the Western people falter is uh their materialistic attitude. Materialistic attitude and their fondness of their eyes.<br />
......<br /> 
So this madness of antique has to go away from our minds."<br />

<b>Objectives:</b><br />
4. To open the minds of people through meetings introducing "thoughtless awareness" which discovers the subtle which at present is lost in gross words, books and dogmas.<br />
5. To introduce the only one internal living religion lying dead and camouflaged under external practices and precepts of religion in all the human beings and for this to organize tours and hold spiritual meetings as per wishes of Mātājī.<br />
