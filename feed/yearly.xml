<font size="+2"><b>You Replace It [EGO] By The Will Of Your Self.</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Now she asked Me, "What is the surrender?" Surrendering, as I am saying, that is to be done in three stages.<br />
......<br />
So the first point is to surrender by understanding rationally.<br />
......<br />
Ego and your will is to be found out. How? By finding out your Self.<br />
Now, what is your Self? Is the Spirit within you. All right?<br />
How do you know your Self? Because, after Realization, It vibrates and It tells you. So, your will becomes the will of your Spirit, not of your ego, because you have also superego.<br />
And with ego you have done mistakes, you have achieved no evolution. You have achieved nothing through your ego. But you don't trust your ego, don't challenge it, you don't over power it, but you replace it by the will of your Self. That's a part within you.<br />
The more you start learning about vibrations, learning what they are saying to you, how they teach you, you'll learn about your Self.<br />
......<br />
Now this is what is the surrender: is the space more there. Because you don't allow this to work out [ego], or this to work out [superego] but just allow a space. So it starts opening out.<br />
......<br />
Today, as we know that, this is the day of Muhammad Sāhab's Birthday.<br />
And we have to understand that all these Incarnations came at different times. They all came at different times. And They came as a continuous process of evolution of man.<br />
No question of conflict or anything with Them. No question. You see, human beings can't understand! Because they create conflict, they have lived with conflicts, you see.<br />
This thing is closing down, let's see.<br />
So They just came on this Earth, nobody's property. They came as Incarnations on this Earth, all of Them.<br />
He [Muhammad Sāhab] came after Christ. See His position! "<br />

Why not ask: 'Śhrī Gaṇeśh, make us good instruments of Sahaja Yoga. Give us strength to give Realization to people and talk about Sahaja Yoga.'<br />

So in the same way, without taking the permission of Śhrī Gaṇeśha, Kuṇḍalinī won't rise. Is very difficult, impossible I should say. Of course, the Mūlādhāra will go on like this, pumping just like a heart, but it won't come up because Kuṇḍalinī would like to do but He won't allow Her to go on.<br />
.......<br />
[You] must talk about it. You must tell people. You must go around. Don't be afraid! Gaṇeśha will protect you, He'll help you, He'll be very happy. He'll work it out everything for you. All problems can be solved. Everything can be done. Believe in His Power. Have faith in your Mother. That is the Message of Śhrī Gaṇeśha."<br />

<font size="+2"><b></b>You Have Come To Sahaja Yoga To Ascend<br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Today is a great day when we are celebrating Mahālakṣhmī's Pūjā.<br />
You must be knowing that today is the day of Mary, Mother of Christ, who was Mahālakṣhmī.<br />
Mahālakṣhmī's Incarnation is very important for Sahaja Yoga.<br />
First, She establishes our dharma, by which we become righteous, we become religious in the real sense. After the light of Realization we cannot do anything that is not dharma.<br />
As you know what is dharma is, and the maryādās, the boundaries of our behavior.<br />
......<br />
By the ascent, with this Principle, you achieve a personality by which you become a Universal Being. You understand the problems of your country and of your race, and you transcend to see what's wrong with them and how to correct them.<br />
......<br />
Even people come to Sahaja Yoga and they start going either to the left or to the right. One has to keep a proper watch. Because you have come to Sahaja Yoga to ascend.<br />
Now, if you move to the right side, then you start fighting with your leader, finding faults with the leader, and, as Christ has said, you become "murmuring souls": you start talking ill about the leader.<br />
......<br />
There is no need to start some new methods.<br />
If [they do] so, they should get out of Sahaja Yoga. This is the worst type of ego!<br />
And one should not have anything to do with such people.<br />
Already, everything has been researched in Sahaja Yoga. All the knowledge is already there.<br />
......<br />
The Christianity has failed because they did ... did not recognize the Powers of Mary."<br />

<font size="+2"><b></b>Treat Each Other As Brothers And Sisters<br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Like uh-uh... people start choosing their life partners in Sahaj Yog. That is not allowed. That is not allowed. You are not to spoil your Āśhrams, your centers, using them for a marriage uh-uh searching society. You must respect it! This point you must respect. If you have to marry, then you can find your life partner outside Sahaja Yoga, to begin with. But if you want to marry in Sahaja Yoga, then you should not go on searching people in Sahaj Yog. Is a very dangerous thing for Sahaj Yog itself and for you people. That is one thing one should never try to do with Sahaja Yogis.<br />
For all practical pur... purposes you are brothers and sisters. And that's why I always encourage marriages between people who belong to another country or ano... another centers.<br />
......<br />
It's very wrong to do such a thing as to arrange your marriage with a Sahaja Yogi by yourself. It will be dangerous. I don't want to say anything, but it won't turn out to be good because it is anti-God activity, absolutely anti-God.<br />
You are supposed to develop your brahmacharya, you are supposed to develop your Mūlādhāra. Instead of that, if you start using a Sahaja Yoginī or a Sahaja Yogi for the selection of your married life, it's going to be very, very troublesome: your Mūlādhāra will not settle down. I mean that's a very bad stroke for your development.<br />
......<br />
For your own sake, for your own pleasures, you should not spoil the name of Sahaja Yoga.<br />
That is one thing I have seen, so I would say that today, as it is the day of purity between relationship, let us know that you have to treat each o... each other as brothers and sisters.<br />
No such play should be followed. Don't allow your mind to drift into this. Because if you allow, then there's no end to it. As it is, you know it is how hard it is to bring you back to normalcy.<br />
......<br />
So the maryādās are to be established first with Me, that understand that you should not try to trouble Me, at all, like this.<br />
Secondly, you must try to please Me by being good people.<br />
I hear that uh somebody is trying to be very egoistical. He doesn't even put on My tapes, he just gives his own lectures. This kind of a thing is very surprising! How can people do like that?"<br />

<font size="+2"><b>I Bless You That You All Become Gurus</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Today is a very great day for all the Sahaja Yogi[s]. Because Sahasrāra opened in you, you could feel the existence of God. ...... This's a very big opening all over the world. Today I say that's why is one of the greatest day for you.<br />
......<br />
But now I have to say that quite a lot of you can become gurus, means teachers, and you should act as teachers.<br />
To act as teacher you should know Sahaja Yoga, the theory and the practice of it, thoroughly well and then you can become a guru. It's a very responsibility, lot of understanding for a guru.<br />
......<br /> 
So you have to be a perfect Sahaja Yogi, thenly [then only] you can be a guru. And so many of you can be, but you have to ascertain first: `Are you capable of being your guru or not?'<br />
......<br />
You have to do now My work. I won't be able to go all over, but you have to go to other countries and create new Sahaja Yogis. You can do it.<br />
......<br />
So, I'm telling you that you have to take over and work it out. That doesn't mean you cancel Me [some laughter], no, not at all. I am there with you and every place you work you put My Photograph, but Realization you have to give and try to give mass Realization. If that doesn't work out, then you should know you are not a guru. If you can give mass Realization, then only you are a guru. Otherwise you are not. I said you can use My Photograph but you have to give Realization to people. This is the sign of a guru.<br />
......<br />
This is a big power you have got, you all should use. First of all you can use a group if you want, and afterwards you should do it individually. Can you imagine all of you, if you become gurus, how many Sahaja Yogis we'll have all over the world‽<br />
......<br />
This is you[r] responsibility. This is how Sahaja Yoga will grow. Otherwise, after I'll retire or I'll don't go anywhere, then Sahaja Yoga will go into waste. So it is for you to carry the torch, the light. It's your responsibility now. You have got your Realization.<br />
......<br />
This is the day of Guru Pūrṇimā and I bless you that you all become gurus.<br />
......<br />
 It is not My old age but I want to give you a complete freedom to spread Sahaja Yoga. You have got with free and you also have to give it to people free -- not to charge there.<br />
......<br />
You have to save the world. All My work is that."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>All Viṣhṇu Principles Are Now Awakened Within You</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"It is such a great day today, that the French call ... got their liberation, [laughing:] and this day. [The French National Day, 1789-0714, is the anniversary of the Storming of the Bastille.]<br />
So, the liberation through anger, when it comes, hatred is the basis of these revolutions and these, so-called, achieved liberations.<br />
If the liberation takes place within yourself, so that you are no more [a] slave of any one of these horrible destructive forces and negative forces, then it's a real liberation.<br />
The second thing that has happened in France, first time in Europe, it has been recognized as dharma. It's a very big thing, and give a hand to it. [Applause.] It is recognized that Sahaja Yoga is Dharma. [Laughs.] It is! But today it was recognized. This is a very big thing.<br />
......<br />
But today, as Sahaja Yoga is established is dharma, we have to know about Śhrī Viṣhṇu, who is the Basis of Dharma.<br />
......<br />
So now, where is the dharma? Dharma is within. And that is why this Viṣhṇu Principle is to be awakened within yourself.<br /> 
And this Principle then expands into many ways. Because Viṣhṇu is the One who is ... the One who cures. We call Him a Dhanvantari, means a doctor. He is the One who cures. Because: He is our preserver. He is the preserver of human beings. So if you preserve your dharma, then you don't get sick. And if you get sick, it is Viṣhṇu who will preserve, who will cure you. So, He is the One who is ah-ah ... we can call Dhanvantari: is a doctor.<br />
......<br />
This is the dharma, which you have accepted. I never told you anything, but you have accepted. And you have imbibed, and you are enjoying it.<br />
Now if they accept us as dharma, what is so special? We are the only dharma.<br />
The rest are all adharmīs. They call themselves dhārmik, [but] they have no dharma in them.<br />
Unless and until you have dharm by which you get a balance, wisdom, you cannot ascend.<br />
But if you ascend even without dharma, Sahaja Yoga is so great, I've seen, people who were quiet adhārmik and all that [snaping the right fingers:] just got Realization. If you ascend, then dharma trickles down: they become dhārmik.<br />
......<br />
So, for us [is] not difficult to establish Viṣhṇu Principle within us. But to recognize that we have those.<br />
You see, suddenly I find Sahaja Yogis become extremely humble, and they don't want to know what they have. You can cure people, you are a Dhanvantari. You can give Realization to people. All Viṣhṇu Principles are now awakened within you, and you must utilized. <br />
......<br />
But I think you should read the one thousand names of Viṣhṇu, [coughs] and you will know how many qualities you can have."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>This Great Brahma Śhakti Is At Your Lotus Feet</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Every time it's such a beautiful surprise to see how Sahaja Yogis are getting one with the Divine. The expression of their joy, the conception of the Divine, you can see very clearly.<br />
This is how I want you all to sit in the Kingdom of God as I am sitting today.<br />
[After 12 seconds:] We have to realize: that we are now the part and parcel of that Cosmic Consciousness Itself. The Brahma. The One that creates, which coordinates, which plans into all the details, and the One that loves through Its creation, through Its expression, is that Cosmic Consciousness.<br /> 
We are not only in it, but we can handle it, we can regulate it, we can use it, we can work it out.<br />
......<br />
But this cycle [of the five elements] is broken only by the awakening of the Kuṇḍalinī. Because you enter into the Highest of Highest, which is the Cosmic Consciousness-ss, which you know how to regulate yourself.<br />
That Cosmic Consciousness is the Param Tattwa, is the Principle of all the Principles, controls all the principles. So it controls also the Principles of all these Five Elements. It controls the Mana Śhakti. It controls the evolution, and gives you the power to evolve others.<br />
So this great Brahma Śhakti is at your lotus feet.<br />
......<br />
You are eternal bliss-ss and awareness, the consciousness: the pure consciousness."<br />
