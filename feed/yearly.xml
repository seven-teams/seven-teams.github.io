<p>
"It's said that, "At Sahasrāra, the Goddess incarnates as Mahāmāyā." Because the job She has to do is of a very different nature.<br />
At the Heart chakra, Anāhata, She has to just defend, just defend, the seekers from the clutches of the evil forces, which are also not so subtle. They are ... uh very gross ... like ... forms, human forms. And it's easy to fight and have a war with them, kill them.<br />
But at the point of Sahasrāra, the work is very complicated. First of all, the Sahasrāra of the human beings is itself a very complicated thing.<br />
......<br />
As it is this Mahāmāyā, no one can understand. Even Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, Maheśha could not understand, is so tremendous. It has played tricks on Them also! <br />
......<br />
Another point about Mahāmāyā is: you being the Mahāmāyā, you are not afraid.<br />
Supposing, Chaṇḍī has to stand here with Her sword in Her hand, nobody would dare go near Her.<br />
But despite that you people shake sometimes, I don't know why!"<br />

<font size="+2"><b>Saṅkocha Is A Complete Cultural Stuff</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Now, in the Dwāpar [Tretā] Yuga when Śhrī Rāma came, the idea of ... kingship, kingship, and rulership started. So-o, the greatest emphasis was on the goodwill of the people. The people had to have goodwill: for the people, and for the king, and for the betterment of humanity. The will, that is the right side.<br />
So how to create the goodwill?<br />
......<br />
First the leader has to sacrifice and show how far he can go in sacrificing to keep the moral and the goodwill of the people.<br />
......<br />
You see, 'formality of the heart'. You see to, not to say something, in such a way, that eh-eh-you touch the wrong side of the person ...... is saṅkocha.<br />
......<br />
So this saṅkoch one has to learn, the maryādā: means the boundaries of your relationships with [<font color="orange">unclear</font>].<br />
......<br />
The saṅkocha is a complete cultural stuff. So, we have a cultural tradition which we have to learn from Śhrī Rām.<br />
......<br />
Nothing works out without maryādā."<br />

<font size="+2"><b>Only Through Excellence You Will Really Become Sahaja Yogis</b><br /></font>
</p>

<p>
"Today we are here to worship the Resurrection of Christ, and also to thank Him for giving us an ideal life of a Saint who has to work for the benevolence of the whole world.<br />
......<br />
As soon as you are connected with Christ, the whole attitude has to change.<br />
So, to be connected with Christ means, 'What are the qualities of Christ you have imbibed within yourself?' That's the minimum of minimum. What did you get out of His life? Is it that He has cured people, all right, so you should get cured? He gave eyes to people, so you must get your eyes back.<br />
......<br />
When the Energy of Christ flows through you, you express Him.<br />
......"<br />
That's the first sign of a Sahaja Yogi, that he looks forward to that time when he can meditate. [Drinks water.] That is a time you're really in connection with the Divine and you enjoy the most.<br />
......<br />
So you have to judge yourself. This is the time for you to judge.<br />
You are in connection with Christ. He achieved His Resurrection, by which we have to achieve our Resurrection. But what have we done to achieve that Resurrection which He has achieved?<br />
......<br />
So you have to be awakened to this fact that we are Sahaja Yogis. We have a special responsibility as our connection with Christ is our main responsibility is all the time, intensely to think what we can do for the betterment of human beings. And what are we doing about it?<br />
First I used to say, "Count your blessings," because that was the best way to make people understand that there are blessings in Sahaj Yoga. Now I would say, 'Count your deeds.' What have you done for Sahaj Yog? Sahaja Yoga has done so much for you.<br />
To say that Paramachaitanya will look after is absolutely absurd! If Paramachaitanya could do everything, why should It create human beings? One Adam and Eve were sufficient.<br />
You have to do it. Unless and until you become deep, it, it cannot trigger, it is helpless. It's only through you it is going to work out.<br />
......<br />
Mediocracy [mediocrity] has no place in Sahaja Yoga. Only through excellence you will enjoy. Only through excellence you will really become Sahaja Yogis. Otherwise, you could be a headache to Me and to yourself. You would be a headache to Sahaja Yogis/<br />
......<br />
To be in connection with Christ is to be enjoying your meditation. 

All right. So Pūjā is another thing which is, I know it, helps you a lot. It gives you a definite push, I should say, but you don't retain it. You don't retain it, then what's the use? So also you have to retain, should have power to retain. That's only possible if you have touched your depths, which you have.<br />
......<br />
And I hope all of you come to Sahasrāra Day after very intensive meditative time. Otherwise, suddenly I'll find people who are doing Sahasrāra Pūjā with their all Sahasrāras caught up."<br />

<p>
"Birthday of your Mother, and all such celebrations, have a very deep significance. Because on such occasions, special vibrations flow in the atmosphere. When all the celestial bodies, the Eternal Personalities, Gods and Goddesses, s-s-sing the praise, and that's how the whole atmosphere is filled with mirth and happiness.<br />
......<br />
Mediation is very important after Sahaja Yoga. You have slept and slept all your life: sleeping is not so important. You have to today promise Me that, from tomorrow, you all are going to get up in the morning and meditate.<br />
......<br />
[Do] you know that Sahaja Yoga is the only way? Is the only method that Divine Grace has given you, by which you are going to transform the whole world.<br />
And lazy lumps, how can they help Sahaja Yoga? Laziness is the worst thing.<br />
Today, I know today is not a day to say all these things, but you all have to promise to Me, that: `You are going to give up your laziness,' Swāhā. That's what I have seen that, whenever I meet you people, you are caught up.<br />
......<br />
So, one has to take a very, very pragmatic attitude towards-s Sahaj Yog, and Sahaja Yoga related to ourselves.<br />
......<br />
But first and foremost thing is: that you have to be absolutely all right. You have to learn Sahaja Yoga, you have to know, you have to be experts."<br />

<p>
"And when the children don't respect their mothers because they have no respect for anything else whatsoever. In the first thing and the last thing is the respect for the mother. If one does not respect the mother, or the motherhood, that means he has no respect for himself either.<br />
So how does he exist? He exists through his mother. So mother is a very-very important intuition ... institution for the whole creation, for your creation and for the creation of your children and all the progeny that has to come.<br />
......<br />
But the mother who is your own mother, whom you know as your mother, who gives you physical birth, is the mother who gives you much more than you know of. Because her blood has her vibrations, and when she gives you her blood she gives you her vibrations, she gives her sustainance [sustenance], she gives you her desires and also she gives you a push in your evolution if she is a[n] evolved person.<br />
Now, in mother and the child relationship, mother gives a lot. She give[s] ... makes your complete left side. She creates all that left side in you. Because she has desired for you, so she creates that. On the right side she gives you all the beauty of delicate things. And also the hunches that you get in your business or all the flexible moments of your life that you think, `From where unknown I got something?', that's your mother's blessing on you.<br />
You choose your own mother, too, when you are born. So no use just condemning your mother because she's like this, she's a horrid woman, and she's this and that and that. Now, you have chosen her; so better have it.<br />
And she is a very big part of you, I must say.<br />
......<br />
It's a most responsible position is that of a mother. It is even a much more responsible than that of a king has it, to be a mother, because the king can only go up to material level, or up to physical level.<br />
And up to rational level, at the most, a philosopher can go.<br />
And the emotional level may be fulfilled by the wife.<br />
All these things may be done by other people, but spiritual level you can only achieve from your mother's grace."<br />
......<br />
So on this day of Mother Day I would like to bless you, that now you have to give birth to so many thousands of people.<br />
So the power that your Mother has, of giving birth, the spiritual birth, be bestowed upon all of you so that you do this work with the same grace and with the same patience and love and enjoyment."<br />

</p>

<p>
"Now she asked Me, "What is the surrender?" Surrendering, as I am saying, that is to be done in three stages.<br />
......<br />
So the first point is to surrender by understanding rationally.<br />
......<br />
The more you start learning about vibrations, learning what they are saying to you, how they teach you, you'll learn about your Self.<br />
......<br />
Attention is not in the mind alone! Attention is all along. And is generated through your ... Is generated, I mean it is not generated we should say, but we can say it is, it is a sort of, looked after or maintained or a... attend[ed] to, through your liver. But, you see, the evolution of mind, as the mind grows up, you will see this attention becomes improved.<br />
......<br />
Then above, the God's Attention is not like yours. You see, your attention is much more than anyone ... that an animal's attention is, that you can realize. But God's Attention is manifold dynamic than yours is. So when you become [one] with That, you see, that Attention, becomes your attention: it starts flowing through you. So it forms in another way, that is the God's Attention, and you start getting the vibrations in the hand.<br />
......<br />
And you develop that sort of a sheath here, you can say, and you start feeling the vibrations. But again, when you go this way a little bit more, it stops. Or this way more, it stops. Again you bring it in the center, and gradually allow the space to be more. Now this is what is the surrender: is the space more there. Because you don't allow this to work out [ego], or this to work out [superego] but just allow a space. So it starts opening out.<br />
......<br />
When you allow this space to increase more, you see, then what happens: these chakras also open out. In these chakras your own Deities are there. They have their own thing and they are one with it, you see. So it works in unison. And that's why the integration takes place.<br />
But this spacing, leaving this space itself, means surrender, in the normal way understanding. Because the Dynamic is there. [The] Dynamic is all-pervading, is working out. All right? It is all knowing. It is working out Its job. It is correct. But the problem is: your attention has not grown that subtle, is to enter into It. One [when] it becomes that subtle -- only human beings can become that -- it opens out this thing."<br />

</p>

<p>
"Today I want to tell you about further meditation: how we have to do and how we have to understand ourselves.<br />
......<br />
But now, as you have entered into the Kingdom of God and the Power of God is flowing through you, you must know that your solutions and your styles have to be different now, that is, you have to put your attention at the disposal of God.<br />
......<br />
Your attention itself is now flooded with light. You do not have to go to any books, you do not have to go anywhere. Your attention itself is flooded with that light, which is dynamic.<br />
Now, if anything comes [to] your attention, you just connect your attention with the Divine's Attention. How? By saying, 'All right, let it be done. Let this be done, is Your wish.' "Thy will be done." This is what you should say: "Thy will be done."<br />
You just say this, you will be surprised. And then the whole mechanism, that enlightened attention of yours is the part of the attention of God Itself. So the whole thing will work out, the whole force as you have worked for your personal problem before, now the whole of it will work out and it will happen. It's such a wonderful thing.<br />
......<br />
To approach to the problem is only possible if you are a subtle being. If you are not a subtle being you cannot approach any problem.<br />
......<br />
I think we should really write it down all the things that have to be done to look after your body. That is very important.<br />
......<br />
Good health is possible only if you understand the balance in that person, every understanding about how the body acts and what happens to body, small, small things.<br />
......<br />
You see, Sahaja Yogis have to be pe... perfect, absolutely perfect."<br />

"We have to understand that people are not normal in these modern times. There's something going wrong with them somewhere. It may be something serious is happening within us, which is giving such a collective effect outside.<br />
Now the trouble is: we do not know what we are inside. Unless and until we know what we are, unless and until there is light within us, we cannot understand what's the problem with us is.<br />
......<br />
Today the war is within, within ourselves, not without. We are not realizing how it is building up within ourselves.<br />
......<br />
On the whole, England is the heart of the whole universe. From here, everything circulates.<br />
You have no idea of this country. You have no esteem of this country. The way we have tortured our Motherland here, I wish people could know! She is suffering within Herself.<br />
Only Blake has cried. He has cried of Jerusalem, and that's what I'm talking about. He could see that vision because He was that sensitive. He's the one who was a realized Soul. And He was that sensitive, He could feel it. And the way He has described, the way He has talked, the glory of this country.<br />
All this inertia, all this lethargy, all these curses that are settling into this country are because of our foolishness and stupidity.<br />
You are the most dynamic people. And not only that, in spirituality you are very dynamic. For your spiritual work, you can be very, very dynamic. You are the ones who are going to throw away all the shackles of nonsense and you are the one who are groing [going] to recreate a beautiful arena of for the whole world."<br />

<p>
"Now I always enjoyed Hampstead. Because, as I have told you, in London, many people who were great spiritual[s] lived in this area. They preferred it to other places. So, I believe that many people who live in this area must be also spiritual, must have taken their birth with the idea of achieving their Self-realization.<br />
......<br />
Then why not grow? When are we going to grow? When are we going to become fully that? Time is very short, My children. Time is very, very short. Believe Me!<br />
......<br />
So, one has to understand that, unless and until we develop that basic humility within ourselves, we are not going to do very well in England. It's for all the Sahaja Yogis as well as for people who have come here.<br />
It's a very, very, serious problem, and you are placed in the most vital parts of the universe, that is, this England, that's the Heart!<br />
And if you now, any way, escape your responsibility, you will be held responsible. I am telling you now very strongly! Because today I had big lectures from people saying that, "Mother, You don't say things strongly, and people are to be frightened." I don't's want to frighten you, but you will be held responsible, take it from Me. You are born on this Earth, on this great land for a very great purpose: to create Jerusalem out of this. And now if you run, not going to stand up, you'll be held responsible.<br />
This is what it is. It's a tremendous work one has to do, for which you must prepare yourself. Get to it. I can give Realization, that's all. But I can't give you strength. I mean, you can't make the horse stand up on his four legs, can you?<br />
......<br />
I want you to grow. Not because I want, but Divine wants it. The whole Creation wants it. Otherwise it will have no meaning.<br />
So the responsibility of English Sahaja Yogis, British Sahaja Yogis is very great. Again and again I have requested you and I have told you in whatever way possible, that [you] establish yourself."<br />
