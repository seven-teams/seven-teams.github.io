<b>Gentleman:</b> ...... I know the meaning of this, but what is the significance of keeping them [shoes] 'on the table'?<br />
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> <font color="DarkRed">What is the significance of Bharata carrying the pādukā of Rāma, in the same way.</font> All right?<br />
Have you read Rāmāyaṇa or not, or your ...?<br />
<b>Gentleman:</b> [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] read Rāmāyaṇa.<br />
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> Then all right.<br />
<b>Gentleman:</b> [<font color="orange">unclear</font>].<br />
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> So that is the significance.<br />
And for this also, you have to understand, first of all, vibrations. Where are the vibrations? From where the vibrations are coming?<br />
Then you will know the significance. It is not mental significance: it's actual. Then you will know, What does these shoes mean?', 'What these hair mean?' Everything you will know. All right?<br />
But do not put ... put attention to these.<br />
For example, you see, Indians always ask a question, 'Mother why do You where a white sāṛī, You are a married lady?' All right.<br /> 
See all funny things these,  this not important.<br />
The main thing is: you must get your Realization first, then you will know what everything means, what it says, because it's another realm altogether.<br />
Like I've seen in England, anybody who sees My this thing [bindi], immediately start laughing.<br />

"But uh-uh-uh ... Sītā went with Him, and She supported Him. And ultimately, it so happened that uh-uhh ... Rāvaṇa came and took away Sītā.<br />
But Śhrī Rāma fought Rāvaṇa, killed him, and brought back His wife.<br />
But when They came back to Their own capital in Ayodhyā, there was a big jubilation.<br /> 
<font color="DarkRed">And Bharat, His brother, he was very much attached to his brother, and he ruled that country with the pādukā, they say is the uh-uh-uh kind of sandalwood yuh-uh-uhh ... chappals they use[d] of his brother. He put it on the throne and ruled.</font><br />
So that is how the Bharat Milan, the meeting of Bharat with Śhrī Rāma, is celebrated, and that was the time He was crowned also as the king.<br />
So it is long time back, thousands of years back, this thing has happened.<br />
That jubilation is very significant: that the right king gets His own throne, and He rules-ss. And all the injustice and all kind of atrocities He has gone through has to be completely finished from His life. And that's why Diwālī is important."<br />

"I'll give you an example of Gujarat. Apart from anything, Gujarat people are very money-oriented: they are worried with the stock exchange, this, that, all the time money, money, money, money, money. Even if they are abro... abroad, they are extremely money-oriented. Sometimes I am surprised. It's impossible to talk to them about Sahaja Yoga. And they like artificial [laughing:] type of things like some gurus or somebody. I don't know from where did they get this.<br />
<font color="DarkRed">Whatever it is, we have a state [city] called Bhavnagar in Gujarat. Bhavnagar people came, they brought for Me those silver slippers, pādukās, to be vibrated. I was surprised, I was happy at least: that these people are thinking about it. So, they did a Pūjā, they did a Havan in Bhavnagar, and also in Baroda.</font><br />
These are the two places were not touched even, touched even, by the bhūkamp [earthquake], by the earthquake. Can you imagine? And Surat which is very much distant, was absolutely shattered. There are Sahaja Yogis, very few, all of them were saved, and their houses also did not move.<br />
This is between the protection of your Mother and the wrath of God Almighty.<br />
One has to understand this very well, that He has powers over all the elements."<br />

We are pleased to mention that Step 6, Divine Events, has been started with the very first 547 events from the period 1997 to 2011. Step 6 of the database aims to facilitate the search and the scholarly research of all Divine Events. It brings in multiple key features, including:<br />
<br />
1. Structured in just 3 simple layers: titles, key quotes and comments.<br />
2. Streamlined categories and subcategories.<br />
3. The color tags groups the categories into subcategories.<br />
4. As we are looking at a number of events between 16,000 and 1,000,000, the monthly category is vital.<br />
5. Everything on one page <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/tag-events/"><font color="deeppink">Tags of the Divine Events</font></a>.<br />
6. The new events added can be easily traced at the link <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/tag-events/"><font color="deeppink">Divine Events Posts</font></a>.<br />
7. A system of dates that allows 00, 0000, x, y, and z in the dates, everything being sorted as per the desired chronological order.<br />
8. Unlimited possibilities.<br />
<br />
Everyone is invited and welcome to add new or contribute to old events at any time via emails or messages. Please kindly share the news with all our brothers and sisters.<br />

"There have been several Incarnations on this Earth who have always said to know your Spirit because without finding his Spirit a human being cannot find God.

<font color="DarkRed">Similarly, dharma is the sterling quality which is sustenance of mankind. Man has evolved from an amoeba to this stage, through his dharma, which is the code of law of evolution. This code of life protects and nourishes our spiritual growth.

"The central channel begins at the Mūlādhāra and passes straight up into the highest chakra of Sahasrāra. <font color="DarkRed">Only partly active up to the human stage, it expresses the evolutionary power of the Virāṭa (sattvaguṇa), virtue and righteousness (dharma) and the Power of Awareness (Jñāna Śhakti).</font><br />
......<br />
The Suṣhumṇā is the central channel for our evolution. It is through this channel that we become collectively conscious and all the disparate factors of our being are integrated in one whole. It makes the connection between our conscious mind and the 'auto' of the autonomic nervous system, the Spirit, which is the reflection of God. <font color="DarkRed">Suṣhumṇā is the Way of Dharma, the straight and narrow path by which we pass through the gate of the Āgñyā chakra to enter into the Kingdom of God in the Sahasrāra.</font><br />
So with the Sahasrāra open and the connection with Suṣhumṇā established, we are open to the source of all awareness where all knowledge dwells, and is sustained by the Primordial Source of All Power (Ādi Śhakti). Meditation in thoughtless awareness is the key to the development of a strong Suṣhumṇā. <font color="DarkRed">Another basic requirement is to enjoy a virtuous and dhārmik life. After Realization, try to keep in thoughtless awareness as much as possible, with attention centered in Suṣhumṇā nāḍī, the channel of the eternal present, where the only time is 'now'. In this way, with Kuṇḍalinī awakening, we transcend time and space.</font>"<br />

"There is a difference between innocence and ignorance. Innocence understands and responds to love without expectations or sense of gaining something out of love.

"Kuṇḍalinī awakening is an event such that this power rises above from within your triangular bone, pierces through six plexuses [chakras] and comes out from Brahmarandhra [hole in fontanel bone].<br />
<font color="DarkRed">Until this event takes place within you, sometimes it's fruitless to talk about dharma [religion].</font> Because talks may perhaps make you a good human being but one cannot get Self-realization.<br />
Unless Self-realization is achieved, all powers within us cannot be expressed. Understand that it is final and ultimate goal of our evolution. When Kuṇḍalinī is awakened, It pierces the Brahmarandhra but post this connection, the Yoga has to be established. Not for too long but meditation for a short while has to be practiced every day.<br />
......<br />
<font color="DarkRed">Another big change that happens is sense of righteousness (dharma) is awakened within us, it's within and not without.</font><br />
For example, any Hindi, Muslim or Christian can commit any sin or do wrong deeds, his religion has no binding upon him. <font color="DarkRed">But it's such a thing that once dharma is awakened within, you cannot commit anything illicit.</font><br />
Compassion, mercy, etc. are awakened within you and despite this you become extremely energetic and dynamic. Whatever you keep doing, you won't feel tired. You do your work in very loving and peaceful way.<br />
With this, you attain peace with you, become absolutely peaceful. A person who has very angry temperament becomes absolutely calm. Because whatever angularities you have within, become all right. All deformities within us are due to problems in plexuses [chakras] and once these chakras become all right, they get all right.<br />
......<br />
This work is going on in seven[ty] countries. Thousands of people get together, but never ever there is any tussle. All live-in harmony together. Yes, sometimes they do tease each other but jokingly, in a friendly manner. You would not have seen such friendships otherwise. Whether this person is from Russia, England, Japan or anywhere they build a collective love amongst themselves.<br />
 <font color="DarkRed">Because of this, when true religion (dharma) is awakened within, they understand that all religions are one, understand totality of all religions. You don't criticize any religion and worship all Dharma Pravartaka [Founder(s) of Religion].</font>"<br />

"So He had to create this creation in such a way, that He could create His own image, reflect it, and make it enjoy itself. It's a very mutual appreciation, as we call it, āndolan.

<font color="DarkRed">"In Sahaja Yoga, as you grow from one to another, there are different types of ānandas.<br />
Like we can say, the Spirit, when you see the Spirit, you get an ānand, called Swānanda. That means you feel your Spirit yourself, and you feel very happy. Then you give Realization to others, you get Parānanda, joy of others. But when you get the enjoyment of well-being, in health and materially all right and everything all right, everything in saṃtoṣha, in complete satisfaction, then it's Brahmānanda. And like that you start feeling higher and higher joys within yourself. Because your nerves start opening to new dimensions.<br />
So you can say that at the Kṛiṣhṇa level, you get Kṛiṣhṇānanda, where you get the sweetness, the mādhurya. And when you see your generosity, then you get Śhivānanda. And when you are with children, you get Gaṇeśhānanda. And that can be described, all those can be described, but Nirānand cannot be described, because it's Mahāmāyā's Joy. All these joys put together is Nirānanda. So there is no place for ego and superego at all. The complete Sahasrāra is opened out, and nothing but the complete rapport is established with the Divine.<br />
And there is a pouring of light all the time in the head and the light going back, that you have seen in My Photograph. As if the Sahasrāra becomes like a sucking child from the Universal Mother, sucking the joy inside, and it is again reflecting back. It would be like the waves reach the shores and then they are again repleted, they go back and then they form a pattern.<br />
Now the joy out of that pattern, how can you describe? The only thing about Nirānanda is, that you have Mahāmāyā so close and so far away, that's the speciality.<br />
Completely thoughtless, silence there, complete silence, you don't think. It's just silence you cannot put into words any more, because the words break with the force of the Ānanda. They cannot hold it."</font><br />

"But the first nihi means without, devoid, and nira means sheer. <font color="DarkRed">Like when you say Nirānanda, Nirātma: Sheer Ātmā, Sheer Joy. Kevalam, the only. There's nothing but Joy. But this one is used, nira or nihi, used in two forms as I told you: one for saying of ... without or devoid of, the another form is [for saying] the only, absolute, the absolute.<br />
So here the joy becomes Nirānanda: Absolute Joy, nothing but joy. It's complete freedom. So you have all kinds of joys, as I told you before: you have Swānanda, the joy of the Spirit, then you have got Brahmānand, the joy of well-being, you've got Līlānanda, Kṛiṣhṇānand, where you have the joy of the play. But when you reach the State of Sahasrāra it is Nirānand: means Sheer, Absolute Joy.<br />
Though the name Nirā is My name, it means Absolute. So, when you put such an adjective before anything else, it becomes absolute. Thus you become absolute. And when you are at that State of Absolute, then there is no place for anything else to be there but your Self.<br />
......<br />
 So this is what, at Sahasrāra you get Nirānanda.<br />
In different stages of Sahaja Yoga we had to start from Śharīrānanda, means the ā... ānand of the body, Mānasānanda, the joy of the mānasa, is the psyche. Then you can say Ahaṅkārānanda, where you have to have the satisfaction of the ego. But the state has now to be established within us is of Nirānanda.</font>"<br />

"Realized Souls have to ascend gradually in their surrender to the innocence of Śhrī Gaṇeśha. People who are simple and chaste like small children, those who are not dominated by dogmatic or fanatical minds, achieve their spontaneous Self-realization (Sahaja Yoga) almost immediately in the mere proximity of highly evolved and God-realized personalities (<i>Avatāras</i>). They feel the sensation of joy on their central nervous system, and as the light of its awareness gradually increases, they experience very unique sensations of bliss. These sensations can be differentiated and also recognized by practice. <font color="DarkRed">In Sanskrit there are four names given to the four kinds of joy experienced by the development of these four types of rippled identities:<br />

In the same way it is happening to humans. There is so much competition and opposition going on, that man has made his brain so specialist that his brain is bursting.<br />
Now a new type of man is needed that can know this Power beyond the mind. This Power which moves this mind also makes the heart beat. To know that Power you can talk all you want, or try all you want, you cannot reach there. This is without any doubt. It is not written anywhere about which I am talking. I am not saying anything very special."<br />

"Regarding money, the same thing: if you go to the temple, give the temple priest a rupee and a quarter. There they have kept potbellied people on hire to worship. 'Once these people come and take money, then religion is fulfilled.' People boast that they have contributed so many lākhs of rupees, this is done, then havan and pūjan [worship], etc.<br />
This has no meaning. Because you have no right. Not only havan and pūjan, [but] you have no right even to mention them.<br />
So why this havan, pūjan?<br />

"[After 16 seconds:] For example, during war, people lost their values, because they lost faith in God. [After 12 seconds:] Chaste women, who believed in chastity, were brutally assaulted. [After 11 seconds:] Very religious people were persecuted, families were broken, many men were killed, and children, women, and old people, were scattered. A very horrible atmosphere of insecurity, overpowered all these nations. Then came the concentration camps, you see, also, which shattered human beings. Because human beings are very delicate instruments. They are the coveted creations, they are the highest, and they were dominated by things like bombs, which are matter. [After 14 seconds:] Thus the Spirit in man died out. People lost faith in righteousness, in love.<br />

[After 10 seconds:] <font color="DarkRed">The industrial revolution followed it, as a result.</font> [After 12 seconds:] And the artificial sense of joy, of security, of love, was accepted by the society.<br />

"The concept of Form and Formless should be explained so that these conflicts get resolved.<br />
When our right channel was being created, the five elements had to be awakened. You know these five elements, all of this creation was made with them. So, these five elements had to be awakened with Yagñyas from the Vedas, and prayers and praises were recited. The five elements were awakened with Yagñyas. It was necessary to awaken these five elements, the fire, the water. It was only after they were awakened that human beings could have put them to use. Agriculture started after that as did the idea of science.<br />
If our Piṅgalā nāḍī hadn't been awakened we wouldn't have researched into science nor known how to use these five elements, how to make electricity and how to use fire. We wouldn't have known fire let alone how to make it!<br />
So that we become capable of making all this, that's why the right side had to be worshipped. That's why Yagñyas were performed. And because all these energies are formless, that's why the Formless was worshipped at that time.<br />
Once these were awakened, people wondered what to do next.<br />
Then meditation started and people came to the Central Path.<br />
Once they started progressing on the Suṣhumṇā, they could see where the Deities were seated and that the bodies of the chakras were made of these five elements. When they studied the elements, they realized that they were governed by Deities. After that, they got to know these Deities one after the other, through meditation.<br />
Then they claimed that they had Forms so the focus shifted from the Formless to Form. Those whose awareness evolved came to the Form.<br />
Then you know what happened to the ones who started believing in the Forms. 'Worship this!', 'Worship that!' Ritualism came into being. Blind faith and religious fanaticism came into being and things were in a miserable state.<br />
<font color="DarkRed">Then there was a great revolution, and not only that, Muhammad Sāheb took His birth. Christ came into this world. These people said that the Formless is to be worshipped and to do away with the Form.</font>"<br />
There was a lot of secrecy in this matter at that time.<br />
However, the Bible says that, 'All that is made by the Earth and the Sky should not be replicated and worshipped.' If Christians could understand this and apply this understanding to the practice of idol worship.<br />
What has the Earth made? The Earth has made all the swayambhus.<br />
Now tell the Christians that the Earth has made the swayambhus Herself and if you make their replicas, they are not worthy of worship because they're imperfect.<br />
These things have a coefficient, too. Forms have a coefficient because of which there is a flow of the Chaitanya.<br />
It is impossible to replicate those forms in exactly the same way. Also, the one who makes them should be a realized Soul who should not put his creation up for sale. Keeping this in mind, mostly all the idols that we worship are of zero value."<br />

"In olden days people were like this, to give their love, to play, to feed, and to give happiness. All this gave them a lot of happiness.<br />
The same thing comes so overwhelmingly within, I do not know how to tell people that, 'Enough is enough, now do not do anything to come closer.'<br />
When people went to villages, just do not know what all they did for them. Whatever we could do for them, we did all that.<br />
Foreigners say that, "We never knew that there is so much of love in Indians." And I said, "Are you not like that? Even you have developed a lot of love."<br />
<font color="DarkRed">They have also developed love and you all also have. A revolution of love has appeared.</font><br />
We people, at the most love our own children, wife, or a few family members. And we do not even know the quantum of our love. Even in that we have our own choice.<br />
For instance, when our son comes back from battlefield, then we think from heart as to how to meet him. Similarly, in enquiring about health, how to meet. Same quantum of love even in ordinary meeting, 'Oh, come, let us meet them,' 'They stay here, let us see them.' If they have any problem, 'Let us find out and help them,' 'Any thing else we can do?'<br />
Such type of things start working from within as our happy vision gets a change totally.<br />
To give, brings happiness. To support somebody, gives happiness.<br />
Even if there are small requirements, a person volunteers to do it. He says, 'Could this be done? That done? Can it be done this way?'<br />
The happiness we experience by this, cannot be compared to the present artificial calculation done for everything.<br />
This love, which surges from Nābhī, which enters our attention, is spread all over. This is so large spread, happy and peaceful, that your health gets well just by meeting people.<br />
I have also seen such people who always get bored with people. If somebody visits them, they say over the phone, 'Brother, I am not at home, please go.' They keep running. Then they will be running from morning to [till] evening."<br />

"<font color="DarkRed">Modern democracies began to emerge in the eighteenth century, but at around the same time, with the advancement of science, the industrial revolution began to manifest itself. What we call industrial and commercial values were also generated by the advent of the industrial or technological society.</font> As it is, science is absolutely amoral. It does not conform to the rules and regulations laid down for the human value system. Science is the knowledge of matter and matter has its own internal regulations. Unlike human beings, matter does not have free will with which to establish any ethical value system for itself. In pure science, which is amoral, this quality has been carried over, almost without anyone noticing, into the practical and applied field through technology. Thus, industry and (in close association with it) commerce have become absolutely amoral.<br />
......<br />
<font color="DarkRed">There is a tendency, built up in the West since the time of Enlightenment and the democratic revolutions of the 18th century, that we should be free to absorb all the unrighteous, unholy, inauspicious and destructive ideas that we can find in every film, every book, and every newspaper, whatever the source. Somehow people want to take up the challenge to become the evil force themselves. People have now to decide if they want to stop this democratic derailment by understanding what must be done. The progress that the West is proud of is towards complete destruction, as human beings have the freedom to achieve heaven or go to hell and also they have the tremendous power of rationality to justify their doom.</font>"<br />

"... the Kuṇḍalinī, the residual Divine Power, resides in the triangular bone at the base of the spine. It is the germinating power of the seed of your being. This seed sprouts through Sahaja Yoga. I am like the gardener who pours some water on the seeds which he has planted in his garden. At first, only a few flowers come up, but at the time of the blossoming the phenomenon of en masse Self-realization is manifested. <font color="red">This Divine Love that I pour is your own right for this is the culminating point of the human evolution which has been promised by the Scriptures.</font>

<font color="red">If love cannot blossom in the optimum conditions of marriage how can it blossom out of it? How can the whole world know love?</font><br />
......<br />
They [husband and wife] are not similar but both are equal, no doubt! One is the right and the other the left wheel of the chariot. If one wheel is bigger than the other, the chariot cannot move properly. Both must be respected. The husband-wife relationship has to be absolutely informal; all artificiality must be dropped. <font color="red">They must love and also sometimes quarrel to show their concern. This is the sign of a healthy relationship. But a woman has to behave like a woman and man has to be like a man. Spontaneous fidelity, love and mutual sharing are the only way one can give and receive the joy of married life.</font> The slightest deviation from conjugal fidelity must be absolutely avoided, and if committed, openly confessed. A person who does not believe in a one-woman one-man relationship should not marry at all; why make another person unhappy? The effects of secret infidelity are of the worst kind and can ruin the whole society?<br />
......<br />
What sin can you commit that I cannot devour? <font color="red">You know, the Devī's Love is like the bottom of the ocean; no matter how big the ocean is, its bottom is always bigger.</font><br />

"Magnanimity of mind is very pleasing and it attracts others. This magnanimity lies within human being and is awakened by Kuṇḍalinī. But how can those people have this joy of spontaneity who are living in artificial atmosphere? Although Kuṇḍalinī has been awakened and She has pierced Brahmarandhra yet heart must be pierced. <font color="red">But some Sahaja Yogis have hearts like stones, absolutely devoid of love; they use sarcastic words while talking to others and want to show that they are great. On many occasions I have seen, people push others or shout at others even in My presence. Particularly, when you shout at the children, I feel pain in My heart. At least Sahaja Yogis should have deep love for each other. When you know that you are the children of the same Mother, why do you look down upon some people? Are you perfect? Are there no faults in you? We only talk of Universal Love. If you have no love for each other amongst you, then in which mankind will it be seen? All I want to tell you is to clean your minds of venomous thoughts that you have for other Sahaja Yogis.</font><br />
If a Sahaja Yogi visits your town, invite him, look after him, as if he is your brother. His happiness will purify your homes. I cannot understand how there can be groups among the Sahaja Yogis, because every moment your condition is improving or going down.<br />
Know that making such groups is disastrous. <font color="red">Look at the good qualities of others and enjoy their love.</font> Don't worry about their bad qualities. Leave them for Me. You will realize in meditation that this is the only way of opening the fountains of bliss."<br />

"<font color="red">When you start feeling love, respect and awe towards God Almighty, it's a sign that your faith and belief, that God Almighty is all-powerful and also that He takes care of us, has established.</font> God Almighty is always showering us with blessings and His Grace. God Almighty is ever compassionate. You cannot imagine how much compassionate God Almighty is. <font color="red">He is extremely compassionate but equally merciless. It is impossible to survive His wrath. Nothing can stop Him, not even My Love.</font> God Almighty will say that I have given a lot of freedom, lenience to all My children. And that's why they have spoilt. That's why I ask that you do not get into any wrong doings and do not discredit your Mother. I remind you again not to lose your precious time in wasteful activities but completely imbibe Sahaja Yoga."<br />

<font color="red">"The greatest mistake is to close one's heart. However hurt one may be, remember that within there is someone who always loves you. She is your individual mother, your Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
She is connected to the All-pervading Power of Divine Love, which never abandons you.<br />
In Her Love, there are no expectations. There is only a tender glow that takes us to Her presence."</font><br />
<font size="+0"><b>1900-0000 Quote from the booklet Sahaja Yoga the true meditation</b></font>
</p>

<div class="para-divider"></div>

<p>
"<font color="red">Human love means possession and determination.<br />
Divine Love soothes you, It raises you to a new awareness. It is something that's just flowing. Not rationality, nothing. It is to feel, feeling for the pain of others. Feeling for their longing and feeling for their aspirations. Just feel within.</font><br />
With Yoga [Self-realization] we become collectively conscious. We can feel our centers and that of others on the fingertips. As Muhammad Sāhib had said, ``At the Time of Resurrection, your fingers will speak."<br />
The Namāz has the real ritual to know the Spirit.<br />
The Pūjās and worship all pour joy on our central nervous system. We feel the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost, the Chaitanya Laharī in living experience. We become one with the Divine and the rapport is established. The Divine Vibrations indicate and the coding if we know them, we know their meanings. <font color="red">Love has its own bondage -- very sweet and beautiful. We have to know the waves of the Divine Ocean of Grace and enjoy them.</font><br />
If a child comes and spoils our house then we should enjoy the fun of spoiling. If our freedom is challenged by a little child's crying, we are not a wise person. It's abandonment, it's loneliness, it's cutting off from the Primordial One that we are not being able to tolerate other people's freedom. We have to be truly free. When a little child cannot cry in its own home, what kind of freedom is that? If a child cannot eat what he wants in his own home what kind of freedom is that? <font color="red">Of course, this freedom is to be pruned, nourished and developed in the Correct Way of Love.</font>"<br />

<font color="red">"Dear Sahaja Yogis, lots of love to all of you!<br />
You all lovingly came to Santa Cruz [Airport in Mumbai] in the rain but we could only meet for a moment. You showered so much love on Me that I was completely overwhelmed. I was so delighted by it that vibrations from different chakras continuously started flowing through every pore of My body. Many chakras that were dormant until now became active. I was witnessing a miracle of your love. Keep sending such pure love. I bless you that you all will achieve all the infinite that is beyond this mahāmāyā.<br />
This love is not the regular human love and is like Ambrosia. It is like a drizzle but there are waves of the ocean behind it. That ocean has decided to drench you. You should remember that the actions of Me going away from you or Me running towards you, are the two ropes used for churning. I enjoy this as a witness. My chakras are the churner that are churning you and the butter of love comes up. I am standing just like a pole -- immovable and inevitable.<br />
You are worthy of this love. You should stay immersed in that love and share it with others.</font> And distributing this Nectar is the only condition. That Kṛiṣhṇa who stole the butter to share with others should be awakened in you. Somehow you must acquire that butter. As the plane was delayed, I was thinking that you all must be waiting and how it will all work out, and I would have thanked God if you had gone back. I am your innocent Mother. <font color="red">Sometimes I get angry at you when you make a mistake but you should remember that I have come on this Earth because I love you immensely.</font>"<br />

The time it is released, the Dynamic Power of Love can transcend all the evil powers of the world.</font><br />

<p>
<font color="red">"For example the Word, what is the Word? Is it Logos or something? What is that? What is it comprising of, what does that mean, how it starts, from where it has come? It is Auṃ. Auṃ comes from three words uh, ooh, muh. Uh, ooh, muh.<br />
Uh stands for the first creation of the left-hand side, what we call the Mahākālī Power. First only in the world manifestation of the superego took place, so we can say that uh stand for the beginning when only up to the stage when life was not created.<br />
Ooh stands for the other stage, where, now sound is the same. Sound is the same, manifestation is different. The voice is the same, My sound is the same, for example whatever is My sound, you can make it out wherever I speak, this is Mātājī speaking.<br />
Maybe the manifestation is different in uh, ooh, muh, so first uh starts, then comes to ooh, which is Mahāsaraswatī Power. We can say the three notes which we have as, I don't know in English what you say to the notes but we say sah, uh sah [<font color="orange">unclear</font>], the basic three notes, so the second note is that of Mahāsaraswatī by which the life -- sun life -- started working.<br />
And the third one is the muh through which evolution started taking its place. So that is the Mahālakṣhmī stage.<br />
So you have got these Three Powers working together, and that is, in a very short form, we say it is Auṃ.<br />
But it is not only that human beings have said it. When you meditate you have seen that Auṃ. I'm saying that these Three Powers have a third, these three sounds, and that's how this word is created, of Auṃ.<br />
For a realized Soul, Auṃ is a most powerful thing. For example, if you want to protect yourself, the word Auṃ itself can protect, and when these Three Powers combine as Auṃ we say that this only the Child or the Son God represents in its purest form Auṃ. That's why in the life of Christ, or we can say in the life of a personality that represented the Son of God, Auṃ is very important because He embodies that Auṃ within Himself. All these Three Powers are in Him, and in the most innocent form.<br />
......<br />
In this sound of Oṃkāra, the complete sounds of the worlds are there. All the permutations and combinations, the complete melody of this universities within these three sounds uh, ooh, muh. It is based on Auṃ.<br />
When the Kuṇḍalinī moves also, it moves in three ways uh, ooh, muh, because in the lower portion it is the uh. In the center portion it is the ooh, and here it is the muh. Meaning that at the lower portion of the human being we are what was created as dead matter. In the center we are what is creation, means creativity, and in the third is the evolutionary, so even we are divided in three ways -- is, we are, our upper part is muh, central part is ooh and the lower part is uh. That is how we are, and when you say Auṃ in a proper way, you find the Kuṇḍalinī rises.<br />
......<br />
Auṃ works like anything. Now you may say that where is the word Auṃ in the Christian religion? It is in Amen. Amen is nothing but Auṃ, because muh means a nasal sound, and end of a nasal sound, and nuh also means nasal sound, because in the Arabic language it's written like a nee, you see, and nee with My name, you say, nuh, with My name starts nuh, also written with a dot, all of them have got a dot. It's a dot which shows that it's a nuh. And in the Sanskrit language, dot means nuh. And that is why it is muh and nuh. Amen is the same as Auṃ.<br />
Now the problem is everything, as evolution goes up, changes and that's why Auṃ was brought to the level of Amen. Uh became Ah and Ooh became Muh, and Muh became Nuh. As I told you that Christ came as a human being, but He was Gaṇeśha. And the Swastika became the cross. The same way, Auṃ is Amen.<br />
So after every prayer, you are supposed to say Amen. Why not Amen? What does that mean? From there the word Auṃ ends in English language.<br />
......<br />
Now the same word Auṃ is used by negative forces also. How do they use it? They will give this name to some devil, normally they do not, because this is one of the purest words which cannot be Contaminated. Normally they will not, normally they will not. I have not met anyone so far who has got a devil on him with the name Auṃ, and nobody so far has given this name to anyone, but I have seen.<br />
......<br />
He [person giving names] can use, but he cannot use the name of Auṃ, and he cannot use the name of Jesus. He cannot give the name of Śhrī Gaṇeśh. These names are beyond their [<font color="orange">unclear</font>]. You see because they are terrible. ...... They might say all kinds of Auṃs and everything. But with all of these they can attack someone, like this, they say Auṃ namo Śhivaya, it's all right. Auṃ namo Śhiva, now, Auṃ you have put it, in that it neutralizes, they perhaps do not know it neutralizes a little bit. Auṃ namo Śhivaya.<br />
And it means so great, means you bow to Śhiva. That aspect of God which is eternal. But they will say that you take the name Auṃ namo Śhivaya because with that the thing you see, it's overpowered by Śhiva, and that's how they will put Auṃ with that, but they'll never give a single word as Auṃ at [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] point, because no devil will own that name, it's too great. And these are the tricks these people play with the word Auṃ, and you should play with the same. Whenever you feel like that, you just say Auṃ. Don't say anything else, say Auṃ. For you, every sentence has an end. Even if you say Auṃ namo Śhivaya [<font color="orange">unclear</font>]. But even if you say Auṃ Jesus, it's enough. Now in a circle, if you say the complete universe into a circle, then you make three portions of that, you get three arches. Say one is uh, another ooh, another muh. When you try to reconstruct them, then you get uh ooh and muh, there are three arches, you reconstruct them. First arch is bent like this ... uh, ooh, second one like that, and the third one is muh. And the dot on that is the center point Is the center point of the circle, dot on that. Now you have seen how Auṃ is written down, and that is how it is, the three arches are described like that, so the whole creation and the center dot, which is the God Himself, all put together makes the Auṃ, and that is how it is being named. I think I have told you now first of all when the creation too, place, how first the Auṃ was formed. Did I tell you with the parabola, with the drawing, so the first sound, the first sound that started because of the separation, the first separation when it too, place between the two identities, God and His Power, that was the time the sound started, and that sound is nothing else but Auṃ. That sound will be there and will work out till these two identities become one, then there is no relativity left and so there is nothing, so people think the world has come out of nothing, because there is no relativity, when they become two then there is something, otherwise they are one and absolute, and so there is nothing, when the sound merges or finishes or, as we say, disappears [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] That is the time when the whole creation merges into one action. So that is the point where one has to go.<br />
Now, in your own being it happens. First you feel the Auṃ, you feel it sometimes the sound coming, sometimes you feel some sort of tingling going on, because there are seven sounds, which are easily discernible out of this Auṃ. Easily. But there are many, but I am saying at least seven you can easily find out. If you sit down sometimes you might hear some sort of a bell ringing, sometimes you'll hear as if there is a waterfall, and sometimes you'll hear as if in the night, the small crickets are singing. You see all kinds of sounds are coming, you see you feel that they are there, something is happening, in the night, you see, that sort of a feeling you'll get, all different types of sounds there are, but seven sounds you can easily find out, and all of them put together make the Auṃ. So, if you play all of them in a proper manner, in a melodious manner, well we can say in a harmonious manner, then you'll hear the sound Auṃ.<br />
......<br />
So this Auṃ is, is a sound that understands, that talks, hat organizes, that informs, and that is the sound of the Divine Love. This is the electrical feeling that you get on your hand. But this is the sound.<br />
......<br />
So we have got also five very subtle type of expression of five elements, and those are this fine sound of Auṃ, the vibrations are the electrical, there is a magnet in that sound, or in that powered, for a person who is, who is realized. The person who is blessed by God has a magnetic power. That person attracts. That person might not even speak about, but people know about these things. They know that he's a man who's realized, there's something special about him. Immediately you can find it out, what he is. It is because of this sound and the magnet. You must have heard that sound when we converted into matter. In the same way, all these things are converted, the sound becomes a magnet, the magnet becomes the vibrations, the vibrations can become the Spirit. So these are all convertible, and part and parcel of the same thing, the same energy which is the Divine Love, which is Love. Love has a sound, and love has electricity, it has got magnetism. And it has got the power. When all these subtle powers are poured on to any human being, it acts, it acts, and people start improving in their health. You must have heard of experiments where people have tried music on some people who are hot well, and they have been cured. And what happens is that they, the subtler, subtler powers of the sound that we are manifesting, that behind it, the power that is manifesting it, comes into play. Which is a very small thing there, but with you people, when you put you hand this is the sound of Auṃ which is vibrating, it is so micro, microwaved, vibrations, that you cannot see with a magnifying glass, you will not see My finger shaking at all, you'll say they are very steady, but they're very microwaves. And the microwaves, when they pass into the body of the human beings, or anything, there they awaken the microwaves that are sleeping in the body of the human beings, or whatever things you use, and they start generating the second, what you call, phase as the [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] of the outside [<font color="orange">unclear</font>].<br />
......<br />
Now, when you people say Auṃ, realized people, when You say Auṃ, the sound waves of Auṃ, you just try on a person who is. Just now you are having some pain there. All right. Now, just now you put your hand there and say Auṃ. Try it."</font><br />

<font color="red">"Today as Yogi has asked Me to speak about Auṃ, I would like to tell you about the great word called Auṃ: what it is, what it represents, and how it came into being.<br />
......<br />
Auṃ is a word people don't understand because it is at the very beginning of this creation that the energy of God, energy of His Love separated from His identity. He pushed Her, called it as Lāsya, He pushed Her to create, and He became the spectator and She had to create. At that time when She was pushed -- we don't have here something to show you how it worked -- but when He tried to push Her, Her movements went into a kind of a word which is [draws with the right index finger in the air]: written as like this three, A, U and M. So there are three words in it. At the time of that pushing, when the separation took place, there was a sound, this the first sound and that sound is called as Auṃ.<br /> 
So many people call it as Logos, but to understand it you have to go deeper into it to und[erstand] what it is was.<br />
So Her power got divided into three: A, U and M. And that's how She became Auṃ. So Auṃ is the sound which is emitted when She creates, which acts as the basis of the essence of Her Love.<br />
Then how She started creating is a very long story which I won't be able to tell you today, but this Auṃ is the one that She first used to create the innocence on this Earth. So this Auṃ was the innocence with which She filled the whole universe. So Auṃ is nothing but the innocence that you see in children, in so many people, in Saints and in most of the Incarnations, that they are empowered by Their innocence. And this innocence first filled the whole space. Even before creating the space the innocence was there. That was the first creation of element and that was the innocence. So Auṃ is innocence which does all the living work on this Earth.<br />"</font><br />

<font color="red">"<font size="+1">The Sound of Praṇava</font><br />
Praṇava's sound is known as <i>Anāhat</i>. It is generated when the Primordial Cell breaks like the hatching of an egg. It is audible with the departure of the nucleus from the ellipse.<br />
<br />
* The first linear movement of Ādi Śhakti makes the First Primordial Sound -- 'Ā'.<br />
* The push of Sadāśhiva causes the Second Primordial Sound -- 'Ū'.<br />
* The Third Sound -- 'MA' -- is caused by the pause stage, which follows the breathing in and breathing out of the Primordial Zygote.<br />
<br />
Praṇava is therefore the All-pervading Divine Power of Ādi Śhakti, and Anāhat is the sound created, without any percussion, by this Power. It can be understood better by describing Anāhat as the sound announcement of Praṇava.<br />
These three Primordial Syllables 'Ā', 'Ū' and 'MA', represent the Three Powers of the Primordial Mother:<br />
<br />
* 'Ā' represents the existence and Destructive Power of Mahākālī<br />
* 'Ū' represents the Creative Power of Mahāsaraswatī<br />
* 'MA' represents the Sustenance or Evolutionary Power of Mahālakṣhmī.<br />
<br />
These three Primordial Syllables, later on, form the Primordial Words (<i>Bīja Mantras</i>) 'Aim', 'Hrīm' and 'Klīm'. All together these comprise the phonetic words of the Devanāgarī script (Sanskrit), and will be examined in greater detail in the chapter on chakras.<br />
Much before the hatching of the Primordial Egg, the Primordial Zygote reaches the embryonic stage. It starts breathing and creates the Primordial Sound (<i>Anāhata</i>) that fills the entire embryo, which encircles the central point. The breathing of Ādi Śhakti is the Praṇava or Divine Power, while its sound is called Anāhata. This sound is without percussion and is heard on the heart as a pulsation. This sound is a mixture of seven component sounds (<i>Nādabrahman</i>), which when heard together creates the beautiful Word, 'Auṃ'. When it is broken into its component parts it sounds like 'Ā', 'Ū' and 'MA'. It later ascends through the different subtle centers on the path of Kuṇḍalinī (the residual power of Praṇava) and becomes the Word.</font><br />

<font color="red">"Treatment for jaundice is as follows. Boil young radish leaves in water, add rock candy to that water and drink it continuously. Do not drink any other water. Vibrate the water before drinking.<br />
Second treatment is to put some mustard oil in a brass or a bronze bowl and rotate it (oil) in a clockwise direction with either nābhī [finger] or all the fingers. One of the hands -- left or right -- should be towards the photo. Watch both hands, and whichever hand feels lighter should be kept towards the photo. The oil will slowly become thick and yellow. Do not throw this oil in water but take it far away and burn it. You will feel better if you do this two-three times. Do not eat any oil or ghee at all. Give vibration[s] to Nābhī and liver while keeping the other hand towards the photo."</font><br />
