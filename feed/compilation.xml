<font color="DarkRed">"You can attain any destination that you fix. All your autosuggestions will materialize.</font> The remedy that is to be used is: your attention should be on Me and you should make the following conditioning of thoughts on your Āgñyā "How fortunate we are to have been realized! We are Sahaja Yogis. God has chosen us. How can we work if we remain weak? Ādi Śhakti has given us the power to redeem the whole mankind. We can do it and we will do it." On heart you should criticize with these thoughts "How deep is God's love for us! He has given us the Realization. He is the Ocean of Mercy. Ignoring all our mistakes, He is working hard day and night for our welfare and, instead of praying for His forgiveness of our mistakes, we are making complaints against Him and blaming Him!" The following thoughts will please your hearts, "O God, please give us the Power of Your Love. May I be the drop in the Ocean of Your Love that is enveloping the whole universe, so that its loving pulsation is vibrated through My life and I remain engrossed in that bliss." "<br />

<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> Very much!<br />
<b>Gentleman:</b> With the upcoming wars and things?<br />
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> Very much blessed. It's a very much blessed place, specially created. Australia was the first continent to be created.<br />
And the I, if I dare to answer this question, I hope you'll believe Me and not get into ego trips.<br />
<font color="DarkRed">"Australia is a place which is described in the ancient Purāṇas. That a great Saint was sent to Australia, and ther[e] another heaven was created. And that Saint is called as Triśhaṅku which is your South... uh what you call that? Is the ...</font><br />
<b>Dr. Warren Reeves:</b> Southern Cross.<br />
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> <font color="DarkRed">... Southern Cross.<br />
That shows the Southern Cross and you can only see Southern Cross from Australia.<br />
This is one of the Purāṇas, or the Vedas also have mentioned this.</font><br />
And, even before that, Australia is the place which has the Gaṇeśha. The first is the Mūlādhāra chakra, the first center is in Australia. How much wise you should be!<br />
Did you hear Me?<br />

"I went to Australia, and I was amazed the way miracles took place in that country.<br />
<font color="DarkRed">It is said that, in the Purāṇa, there was a Saint called Triśhaṅku, who committed some mistake, little mistake, and he was sent as the Southern Cross, hanging in the air, and was told that, "You must create your own heaven!" And really Australia is Heaven, no doubt, but it's Mūlādhāra! It is Mūlādhāra.</font>"<br />

<b>Dr. Warren Reeves</b> [summarizes a lady:] We live in a country here, which was inhabited by the aboriginal people, who, she says, understood these things. Uh do You have any knowledge or feelings about these people?<br />
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> Very much!<br />
The names are like Paramātā. Paramātā means the Primordial Mother.<br />
Is so many words are ... your ... uh this ... uh the Rock of Ayers is nothing but Gaṇeśha Himself! You see, this is the land of Mūlādhāra chakra.<br />
You don't know what a land you are living in!<br />
Whatever you may try, you cannot lose your innocence in this country. Is a country of innocence. You'll keep it a bit of it, because is a country of innocence! You'll see all that!<br />
<b>Lady:</b> We ... [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] ...<br />
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> Is a very great country!<br />
<font color="DarkRed">Is described in the Purāṇas, in the ancient times, that there was one Great Saint, whom committed some mistake, and he was thrown out in the sky, and God said, "All right, now I'll allow you to go away from here, but I give you a boon again, because you are a great man, that you'll create your own heavens here," and that's the seventh cross." It's called Triśhaṅku in Sanskrit language.</font><br />
So you are great people, you don't know you are born on a very great soil.<br />
This is the Mūlādhāra itself, the first chakra, where Śhrī Gaṇeśha, the innocence, resides.<br />

<b>Another Sahaja Yoginī</b> [laughing]: Yes.<br />
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> For a little amount that you pay, we can maneuver something very good.<br />
You'll be happy to know that Indians also paid lot of money, substantiated in. Of course, you people also paid some money, there. And, actually, if you see that the people who paid, all together, we calculated that. for every couple, even the people who attended the weddings, paid uh-uh-uh two dollar[s] each. [Laughs.]<br />
[Laughing:] [In the West] you cannot buy any present for two dollar[s] each.<br />
But in a collective way it [1985-0208 Marriages Ceremony, Bordi] was so beautiful. And worked out so well. It was such a time, I tell you, unforgettable. As if you were in the Vṛindāvan, beautiful time. <font color="DarkRed">And you saw Southern Cross coming down, both the times, Southern Cross. From Australia it came through that side. I mean, Southern Cross you'll never see in India. But we saw Southern Cross, in India, at the time of marriage. It's a miracle of miracles. All the stars, all the nakṣhatras were there.</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"It was said that a Saint called Triśhaṅkar committed some mistakes and as a punishment he was given some land in the Bay of Bengal and was told to take that land away. As part of the rectification of that curse, he was told to take that land and make a heaven out of it. I have really seen that heaven where I went. Triśhaṅkar is nothing but your Southern Cross and in Sanskrit your Southern Cross is known as the Triśhaṅkar. The parallel between this account in the Purāṇas and history is startling. Geology has shown that Australia and India were joined as part of the original land mass known as Godwana Land. Australia was started as a penal colony where people were sent as punishment from England."</font><br />

"And you will ... some part of the land will go with you there, which will be your own [<font color="orange">unclear</font>]." Then he said, "Also You must give me some blessings," He said, "I will bless that land."

<font color="DarkRed">"About Australia, there's a myth in India, that there was a big Saint, and he was very good, but somehow he made some mistakes, or maybe lots of mistakes. So, God cursed him, and said, "You better go away from India." It was connecting India and Africa.<br />
So the land was brought down, to this point. He gave him the land, God, and He said: "Now you resurrect this land, nd make something out of it."<br />
And this star is called as ... this-ss Triśhaṅku, which is your Southern Cross. This Southern Cross is called as Triśhaṅku, as is men... mentioned in our Purāṇas as this-s Saint who became like that, and God made him into a-eh-eh ... star which is hanging, Triśhaṅku is hanging, on top of this land, and is working out the building up of this country.<br />
He was told that: "You go there, and make a Heaven for the human beings."<br />
