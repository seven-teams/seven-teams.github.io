<font color="DarkRed">"This is the era of Enlightenment. One can see and feel the bubbling of new idioms in our creative world of art, music and all that is beautiful and joy-giving. Integration is the key note of this new regeneration of universal tones. These tones are ripples of the harmonic, dynamic undercurrent music of the Universal Divine Love.<br />
<font color="DarkRed">Is there a possibility of this love expressed in the unity of human beings with God Almighty giving a new vision to the apparent diversities?</font><br />
Is it possible that this unique happening is accessible to many, that they may see their own creative world revolving in the great universe of All-pervading Power?<br />

This is one of the Purāṇas, or the Vedas also have mentioned this.</font><br />
And, even before that, Australia is the place which has the Gaṇeśha. The first is the Mūlādhāra chakra, the first center is in Australia. How much wise you should be!<br />

It's called Triśhaṅku in Sanskrit language.</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"It was said that a Saint called Triśhaṅkar committed some mistakes and as a punishment he was given some land in the Bay of Bengal and was told to take that land away. As part of the rectification of that curse, he was told to take that land and make a heaven out of it. I have really seen that heaven where I went. Triśhaṅkar is nothing but your Southern Cross and in Sanskrit your Southern Cross is known as the Triśhaṅkar. The parallel between this account in the Purāṇas and history is startling.

So the land was brought down, to this point. He gave him the land, God, and He said: "Now you resurrect this land, nd make something out of it."<br />
And this star is called as ... this-ss Triśhaṅku, which is your Southern Cross.
