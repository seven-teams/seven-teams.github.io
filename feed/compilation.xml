Dear Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginīs,<br />
<br />
Jay Śhrī Mātājī!<br />
<br />
We are pleased to mention that this month we are completing 10 years since work on the database started and since the whole picture of the teams and subteams have been instantly envision as a natural extrapolation of an email received from a UK Sahaja Yogi suggesting, at that time, a 1 full year celebrations of 40 Years of Sahaja Yoga in UK.<br />
Of course, the Yearly Topics Team (YTT), which is completely independent from the CCT, had celebrated with posts the 40 Years of Sahaja Yoga in UK in 2014, and, we are told, starting from January it will celebrate 50 Years of Sahaja Yoga in UK.<br />
<br />
Related to CCT, in these 10 years we have started the first 6 Steps, and below we have gathered separately some of the milestones of each step.<br /> 
<br />
<b><font color="blue">STEP 1: Divine Message.</font></b><br />
1a. The upcoming version will have +20K pages.<br />
1b. The upcoming version will have +4.96K events with transcripts/quotes.<br />
<br />
<b><font color="DarkGreen">STEP 2: Eternal Moments.</font></b><br />
2a. More than 24K Photos uploaded to <a href="https://eternalmoments.smugmug.com/"><font color="DarkGreen"><b>Eternal Moments</b></font></a>.<br />
2b. More than 8K photos Moments of Joy uploaded to <a href="https://eternalmoments.smugmug.com/"><font color="DarkGreen"><b>Eternal Moments</b></font></a>.<br />
<br />
<b><font color="maroon">STEP 3: Archives.</font></b><br />
3a. The <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/archives/table.html"><font color="maroon"><b>Data Table</b></font></a> has +1.9K rows.<br />
3b. Already 16 Posts started.<br />
<br />
<b><font color="DarkGreen">STEP 4: Sahaja Image Events.</font></b><br />
4a. More than 1.1K images uploaded to <a href="https://imageevent.com/sahaja"><font color="DarkGreen"><b>Sahaja Image Events</b></font></a> (besides what was uploaded many years back).<br />
4b. Already there are 35 Galleries in 5 Folders.<br />
<br />
<b><font color="blue">STEP 5: Drawings and English+Hindi+Marathi Letters from the Divine Message.</font></b><br />
5a. 52 Drawings.<br />
5b. 31 English Letters.<br />
5c. 6 Hindi Letters.<br />
5d. 37 Marathi Letters.<br />  
<br />
<b><font color="DeepPink">STEP 6: Divine Events.</font></b><br />
6a. Titles of +5K events shared on one single page at <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/tag-events/"> <font color="DeepPink">Divine Events Tag</font></a><br />
<br />
<br />
All these were only possible due to the tremendous help, contributions, and support from hundreds and hundreds of Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginīs from six continents and dozens and dozens of countries, for which we thank them all.<br />
Gradually, more and more collections will be started or will unfold/expand naturally, and our first and foremost thanks are to all artists and collectors, whether of Photos or of publications or personal writings or of anything else, for their dedication and devotion to Śhrī Mātājī, incredible art, generosity, and spirit of sharing. One can only hope that the team will give full justice to acknowledge and praise all their contributions.<br />

Dear Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginīs,<br />
<br />
Jay Śhrī Mātājī!<br />
<br />
We are pleased to mention that Step 6, Divine Events, has now 5,001 Divine Events started and are searchable on one single webpage at the link <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/tag-events/"><font color="deeppink">Tags of the Divine Events</font></a>.
Among these 5,001 Divine Events, 4,938 are from the <font color="blue">Divine Message, Version 9.2</font> (which will be shared today), and 63 others have been started either just by chance or as samples that emerged naturally.<br />
As of today, among these 5,001 Divine Events, only extremely few (less than 10) have extra content besides detailed titles.<br />
Already there are 7,897 other Divine Events tabulated, partially organized, and queued for being started: we are aiming to start them at the rate of +1 per day for the next 20 years.<br />
Priority will be given to the start of new Divine Events: all those which will be started from now on will have some relevant content (comments, recollections, sources, key quotes, files, etc.) and not just titles. So, as the current 5,001 have transcripts or quotes started in Divine Message or on other databases (such as NVA or SDL) or sources, when opportunities arise (such as via requests received or communications), relevant content (comments, recollections, sources, key quotes, files, etc.) will be added to some of them from time to time.<br />
The annual reports will start in 2024. Until then, some color usage and extra features will be explored, and in a couple of weeks a few samples will be shared via a similar post.<br />
We estimate that there will be between 16K to 108K Divine Events when the step 6 will be essentially completed.<br />
Everyone is invited and welcome to add new or contribute to started Divine Events at any time via emails or messages: ideally, with substantial collective support, we can dream and hope to reach a rate of +10 per day Divine Events started for the next 20 years.<br /> 
Please keep in mind that each contributor to a new Divine Event can as well choose the colors for the rows of it (2 or more colors to be chosen from the current 140 colors available).<br />
Please kindly share the news with all our brothers and sisters.<br />

<b>Gentleman:</b> ...... I know the meaning of this, but what is the significance of keeping them [shoes] 'on the table'?<br />
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> <font color="DarkRed">What is the significance of Bharata carrying the pādukā of Rāma, in the same way.</font> All right?<br />
Have you read Rāmāyaṇa or not, or your ...?<br />
<b>Gentleman:</b> [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] read Rāmāyaṇa.<br />
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> Then all right.<br />
<b>Gentleman:</b> [<font color="orange">unclear</font>].<br />
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> So that is the significance.<br />
And for this also, you have to understand, first of all, vibrations. Where are the vibrations? From where the vibrations are coming?<br />
Then you will know the significance. It is not mental significance: it's actual. Then you will know, What does these shoes mean?', 'What these hair mean?' Everything you will know. All right?<br />
But do not put ... put attention to these.<br />
For example, you see, Indians always ask a question, 'Mother why do You where a white sāṛī, You are a married lady?' All right.<br /> 
See all funny things these,  this not important.<br />
The main thing is: you must get your Realization first, then you will know what everything means, what it says, because it's another realm altogether.<br />
Like I've seen in England, anybody who sees My this thing [bindi], immediately start laughing.<br />

"But uh-uh-uh ... Sītā went with Him, and She supported Him. And ultimately, it so happened that uh-uhh ... Rāvaṇa came and took away Sītā.<br />
But Śhrī Rāma fought Rāvaṇa, killed him, and brought back His wife.<br />
But when They came back to Their own capital in Ayodhyā, there was a big jubilation.<br /> 
<font color="DarkRed">And Bharat, His brother, he was very much attached to his brother, and he ruled that country with the pādukā, they say is the uh-uh-uh kind of sandalwood yuh-uh-uhh ... chappals they use[d] of his brother. He put it on the throne and ruled.</font><br />
So that is how the Bharat Milan, the meeting of Bharat with Śhrī Rāma, is celebrated, and that was the time He was crowned also as the king.<br />
So it is long time back, thousands of years back, this thing has happened.<br />
That jubilation is very significant: that the right king gets His own throne, and He rules-ss. And all the injustice and all kind of atrocities He has gone through has to be completely finished from His life. And that's why Diwālī is important."<br />

"I'll give you an example of Gujarat. Apart from anything, Gujarat people are very money-oriented: they are worried with the stock exchange, this, that, all the time money, money, money, money, money. Even if they are abro... abroad, they are extremely money-oriented. Sometimes I am surprised. It's impossible to talk to them about Sahaja Yoga. And they like artificial [laughing:] type of things like some gurus or somebody. I don't know from where did they get this.<br />
<font color="DarkRed">Whatever it is, we have a state [city] called Bhavnagar in Gujarat. Bhavnagar people came, they brought for Me those silver slippers, pādukās, to be vibrated. I was surprised, I was happy at least: that these people are thinking about it. So, they did a Pūjā, they did a Havan in Bhavnagar, and also in Baroda.</font><br />
These are the two places were not touched even, touched even, by the bhūkamp [earthquake], by the earthquake. Can you imagine? And Surat which is very much distant, was absolutely shattered. There are Sahaja Yogis, very few, all of them were saved, and their houses also did not move.<br />
This is between the protection of your Mother and the wrath of God Almighty.<br />
One has to understand this very well, that He has powers over all the elements."<br />

We are pleased to mention that Step 6, Divine Events, has been started with the very first 547 events from the period 1997 to 2011. Step 6 of the database aims to facilitate the search and the scholarly research of all Divine Events. It brings in multiple key features, including:<br />
<br />
1. Structured in just 3 simple layers: titles, key quotes and comments.<br />
2. Streamlined categories and subcategories.<br />
3. The color tags groups the categories into subcategories.<br />
4. As we are looking at a number of events between 16,000 and 1,000,000, the monthly category is vital.<br />
5. Everything on one page <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/tag-events/"><font color="deeppink">Tags of the Divine Events</font></a>.<br />
6. The new events added can be easily traced at the link <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/events/"><font color="deeppink">Divine Events Posts</font></a>.<br />
7. A system of dates that allows 00, 0000, x, y, and z in the dates, everything being sorted as per the desired chronological order.<br />
8. Unlimited possibilities.<br />
<br />
Everyone is invited and welcome to add new or contribute to old events at any time via emails or messages. Please kindly share the news with all our brothers and sisters.<br />

"The central channel begins at the Mūlādhāra and passes straight up into the highest chakra of Sahasrāra. <font color="DarkRed">Only partly active up to the human stage, it expresses the evolutionary power of the Virāṭa (sattvaguṇa), virtue and righteousness (dharma) and the Power of Awareness (Jñāna Śhakti).</font><br />
......<br />
The Suṣhumṇā is the central channel for our evolution. It is through this channel that we become collectively conscious and all the disparate factors of our being are integrated in one whole. It makes the connection between our conscious mind and the 'auto' of the autonomic nervous system, the Spirit, which is the reflection of God. <font color="DarkRed">Suṣhumṇā is the Way of Dharma, the straight and narrow path by which we pass through the gate of the Āgñyā chakra to enter into the Kingdom of God in the Sahasrāra.</font><br />
So with the Sahasrāra open and the connection with Suṣhumṇā established, we are open to the source of all awareness where all knowledge dwells, and is sustained by the Primordial Source of All Power (Ādi Śhakti). Meditation in thoughtless awareness is the key to the development of a strong Suṣhumṇā. <font color="DarkRed">Another basic requirement is to enjoy a virtuous and dhārmik life. After Realization, try to keep in thoughtless awareness as much as possible, with attention centered in Suṣhumṇā nāḍī, the channel of the eternal present, where the only time is 'now'. In this way, with Kuṇḍalinī awakening, we transcend time and space.</font>"<br />

"There is a difference between innocence and ignorance. Innocence understands and responds to love without expectations or sense of gaining something out of love.

"Kuṇḍalinī awakening is an event such that this power rises above from within your triangular bone, pierces through six plexuses [chakras] and comes out from Brahmarandhra [hole in fontanel bone].<br />
<font color="DarkRed">Until this event takes place within you, sometimes it's fruitless to talk about dharma [religion].</font> Because talks may perhaps make you a good human being but one cannot get Self-realization.<br />
Unless Self-realization is achieved, all powers within us cannot be expressed. Understand that it is final and ultimate goal of our evolution. When Kuṇḍalinī is awakened, It pierces the Brahmarandhra but post this connection, the Yoga has to be established. Not for too long but meditation for a short while has to be practiced every day.<br />
......<br />
<font color="DarkRed">Another big change that happens is sense of righteousness (dharma) is awakened within us, it's within and not without.</font><br />
For example, any Hindi, Muslim or Christian can commit any sin or do wrong deeds, his religion has no binding upon him. <font color="DarkRed">But it's such a thing that once dharma is awakened within, you cannot commit anything illicit.</font><br />
Compassion, mercy, etc. are awakened within you and despite this you become extremely energetic and dynamic. Whatever you keep doing, you won't feel tired. You do your work in very loving and peaceful way.<br />
With this, you attain peace with you, become absolutely peaceful. A person who has very angry temperament becomes absolutely calm. Because whatever angularities you have within, become all right. All deformities within us are due to problems in plexuses [chakras] and once these chakras become all right, they get all right.<br />
......<br />
This work is going on in seven[ty] countries. Thousands of people get together, but never ever there is any tussle. All live-in harmony together. Yes, sometimes they do tease each other but jokingly, in a friendly manner. You would not have seen such friendships otherwise. Whether this person is from Russia, England, Japan or anywhere they build a collective love amongst themselves.<br />
 <font color="DarkRed">Because of this, when true religion (dharma) is awakened within, they understand that all religions are one, understand totality of all religions. You don't criticize any religion and worship all Dharma Pravartaka [Founder(s) of Religion].</font>"<br />

<font color="DarkRed">"In Sahaja Yoga, as you grow from one to another, there are different types of ānandas.<br />
Like we can say, the Spirit, when you see the Spirit, you get an ānand, called Swānanda. That means you feel your Spirit yourself, and you feel very happy. Then you give Realization to others, you get Parānanda, joy of others. But when you get the enjoyment of well-being, in health and materially all right and everything all right, everything in saṃtoṣha, in complete satisfaction, then it's Brahmānanda. And like that you start feeling higher and higher joys within yourself. Because your nerves start opening to new dimensions.<br />
So you can say that at the Kṛiṣhṇa level, you get Kṛiṣhṇānanda, where you get the sweetness, the mādhurya. And when you see your generosity, then you get Śhivānanda. And when you are with children, you get Gaṇeśhānanda. And that can be described, all those can be described, but Nirānand cannot be described, because it's Mahāmāyā's Joy. All these joys put together is Nirānanda. So there is no place for ego and superego at all. The complete Sahasrāra is opened out, and nothing but the complete rapport is established with the Divine.<br />
And there is a pouring of light all the time in the head and the light going back, that you have seen in My Photograph. As if the Sahasrāra becomes like a sucking child from the Universal Mother, sucking the joy inside, and it is again reflecting back. It would be like the waves reach the shores and then they are again repleted, they go back and then they form a pattern.<br />
Now the joy out of that pattern, how can you describe? The only thing about Nirānanda is, that you have Mahāmāyā so close and so far away, that's the speciality.<br />
Completely thoughtless, silence there, complete silence, you don't think. It's just silence you cannot put into words any more, because the words break with the force of the Ānanda. They cannot hold it."</font><br />

"But the first nihi means without, devoid, and nira means sheer. <font color="DarkRed">Like when you say Nirānanda, Nirātma: Sheer Ātmā, Sheer Joy. Kevalam, the only. There's nothing but Joy. But this one is used, nira or nihi, used in two forms as I told you: one for saying of ... without or devoid of, the another form is [for saying] the only, absolute, the absolute.<br />
So here the joy becomes Nirānanda: Absolute Joy, nothing but joy. It's complete freedom. So you have all kinds of joys, as I told you before: you have Swānanda, the joy of the Spirit, then you have got Brahmānand, the joy of well-being, you've got Līlānanda, Kṛiṣhṇānand, where you have the joy of the play. But when you reach the State of Sahasrāra it is Nirānand: means Sheer, Absolute Joy.<br />
Though the name Nirā is My name, it means Absolute. So, when you put such an adjective before anything else, it becomes absolute. Thus you become absolute. And when you are at that State of Absolute, then there is no place for anything else to be there but your Self.<br />
......<br />
 So this is what, at Sahasrāra you get Nirānanda.<br />
In different stages of Sahaja Yoga we had to start from Śharīrānanda, means the ā... ānand of the body, Mānasānanda, the joy of the mānasa, is the psyche. Then you can say Ahaṅkārānanda, where you have to have the satisfaction of the ego. But the state has now to be established within us is of Nirānanda.</font>"<br />

"Realized Souls have to ascend gradually in their surrender to the innocence of Śhrī Gaṇeśha. People who are simple and chaste like small children, those who are not dominated by dogmatic or fanatical minds, achieve their spontaneous Self-realization (Sahaja Yoga) almost immediately in the mere proximity of highly evolved and God-realized personalities (<i>Avatāras</i>). They feel the sensation of joy on their central nervous system, and as the light of its awareness gradually increases, they experience very unique sensations of bliss. These sensations can be differentiated and also recognized by practice. <font color="DarkRed">In Sanskrit there are four names given to the four kinds of joy experienced by the development of these four types of rippled identities:<br />

"<font color="DarkRed">In the path of revolution such has been happening, that any person who goes into the expertise of anything he sinks, and finishes off.</font><br />
In the same way it is happening to humans. There is so much competition and opposition going on, that man has made his brain so specialist that his brain is bursting.<br />
Now a new type of man is needed that can know this Power beyond the mind. This Power which moves this mind also makes the heart beat. To know that Power you can talk all you want, or try all you want, you cannot reach there. This is without any doubt. It is not written anywhere about which I am talking. I am not saying anything very special."<br />

"Regarding money, the same thing: if you go to the temple, give the temple priest a rupee and a quarter. There they have kept potbellied people on hire to worship. 'Once these people come and take money, then religion is fulfilled.' People boast that they have contributed so many lākhs of rupees, this is done, then havan and pūjan [worship], etc.<br />
This has no meaning. Because you have no right. Not only havan and pūjan, [but] you have no right even to mention them.<br />
So why this havan, pūjan?<br />
Once you do havan and pūjan then again there is corruption.<br />
<font color="DarkRed">Therefore in our country many revolutions took place. They call them religious but I will say these are intellectual revolutions.</font>"<br />

"[After 16 seconds:] For example, during war, people lost their values, because they lost faith in God. [After 12 seconds:] Chaste women, who believed in chastity, were brutally assaulted. [After 11 seconds:] Very religious people were persecuted, families were broken, many men were killed, and children, women, and old people, were scattered. A very horrible atmosphere of insecurity, overpowered all these nations. Then came the concentration camps, you see, also, which shattered human beings. Because human beings are very delicate instruments. They are the coveted creations, they are the highest, and they were dominated by things like bombs, which are matter. [After 14 seconds:] Thus the Spirit in man died out. People lost faith in righteousness, in love.<br />
[After 15 seconds:] Then a new pattern of securities were built up.<br />
[After 10 seconds:] <font color="DarkRed">The industrial revolution followed it, as a result.</font> [After 12 seconds:] And the artificial sense of joy, of security, of love, was accepted by the society.<br />
This is what man did with his freedom. Because wars are created by man, this is not God's doing."<br />

"<font color="DarkRed">There is a huge revolution taking place in Sahaja: the dharma is getting completely getting established in people in its true form.</font><br />
And due to that people are realizing that there is no point in entertaining such fake gurus who keep robbing them. There is no point in sticking to traditions that make you stupid and bring you down.<br />
Traditions which make you ascend, which take you to higher, which establish you in the Realm of Spirituality, only those traditions are supposed to be regarded as genuine ones."<br />

"The concept of Form and Formless should be explained so that these conflicts get resolved.<br />
When our right channel was being created, the five elements had to be awakened. You know these five elements, all of this creation was made with them. So, these five elements had to be awakened with Yagñyas from the Vedas, and prayers and praises were recited. The five elements were awakened with Yagñyas. It was necessary to awaken these five elements, the fire, the water. It was only after they were awakened that human beings could have put them to use. Agriculture started after that as did the idea of science.<br />
If our Piṅgalā nāḍī hadn't been awakened we wouldn't have researched into science nor known how to use these five elements, how to make electricity and how to use fire. We wouldn't have known fire let alone how to make it!<br />
So that we become capable of making all this, that's why the right side had to be worshipped. That's why Yagñyas were performed. And because all these energies are formless, that's why the Formless was worshipped at that time.<br />
Once these were awakened, people wondered what to do next.<br />
Then meditation started and people came to the Central Path.<br />
Once they started progressing on the Suṣhumṇā, they could see where the Deities were seated and that the bodies of the chakras were made of these five elements. When they studied the elements, they realized that they were governed by Deities. After that, they got to know these Deities one after the other, through meditation.<br />
Then they claimed that they had Forms so the focus shifted from the Formless to Form. Those whose awareness evolved came to the Form.<br />
Then you know what happened to the ones who started believing in the Forms. 'Worship this!', 'Worship that!' Ritualism came into being. Blind faith and religious fanaticism came into being and things were in a miserable state.<br />
<font color="DarkRed">Then there was a great revolution, and not only that, Muhammad Sāheb took His birth. Christ came into this world. These people said that the Formless is to be worshipped and to do away with the Form.</font>"<br />
There was a lot of secrecy in this matter at that time.<br />
However, the Bible says that, 'All that is made by the Earth and the Sky should not be replicated and worshipped.' If Christians could understand this and apply this understanding to the practice of idol worship.<br />
What has the Earth made? The Earth has made all the swayambhus.<br />
Now tell the Christians that the Earth has made the swayambhus Herself and if you make their replicas, they are not worthy of worship because they're imperfect.<br />
These things have a coefficient, too. Forms have a coefficient because of which there is a flow of the Chaitanya.<br />
It is impossible to replicate those forms in exactly the same way. Also, the one who makes them should be a realized Soul who should not put his creation up for sale. Keeping this in mind, mostly all the idols that we worship are of zero value."<br />

"In olden days people were like this, to give their love, to play, to feed, and to give happiness. All this gave them a lot of happiness.<br />
The same thing comes so overwhelmingly within, I do not know how to tell people that, 'Enough is enough, now do not do anything to come closer.'<br />
When people went to villages, just do not know what all they did for them. Whatever we could do for them, we did all that.<br />
Foreigners say that, "We never knew that there is so much of love in Indians." And I said, "Are you not like that? Even you have developed a lot of love."<br />
<font color="DarkRed">They have also developed love and you all also have. A revolution of love has appeared.</font><br />
We people, at the most love our own children, wife, or a few family members. And we do not even know the quantum of our love. Even in that we have our own choice.<br />
For instance, when our son comes back from battlefield, then we think from heart as to how to meet him. Similarly, in enquiring about health, how to meet. Same quantum of love even in ordinary meeting, 'Oh, come, let us meet them,' 'They stay here, let us see them.' If they have any problem, 'Let us find out and help them,' 'Any thing else we can do?'<br />
Such type of things start working from within as our happy vision gets a change totally.<br />
To give, brings happiness. To support somebody, gives happiness.<br />
Even if there are small requirements, a person volunteers to do it. He says, 'Could this be done? That done? Can it be done this way?'<br />
The happiness we experience by this, cannot be compared to the present artificial calculation done for everything.<br />
This love, which surges from Nābhī, which enters our attention, is spread all over. This is so large spread, happy and peaceful, that your health gets well just by meeting people.<br />
I have also seen such people who always get bored with people. If somebody visits them, they say over the phone, 'Brother, I am not at home, please go.' They keep running. Then they will be running from morning to [till] evening."<br />

"<font color="DarkRed">Modern democracies began to emerge in the eighteenth century, but at around the same time, with the advancement of science, the industrial revolution began to manifest itself. What we call industrial and commercial values were also generated by the advent of the industrial or technological society.</font> As it is, science is absolutely amoral. It does not conform to the rules and regulations laid down for the human value system. Science is the knowledge of matter and matter has its own internal regulations. Unlike human beings, matter does not have free will with which to establish any ethical value system for itself. In pure science, which is amoral, this quality has been carried over, almost without anyone noticing, into the practical and applied field through technology. Thus, industry and (in close association with it) commerce have become absolutely amoral.<br />
......<br />
<font color="DarkRed">There is a tendency, built up in the West since the time of Enlightenment and the democratic revolutions of the 18th century, that we should be free to absorb all the unrighteous, unholy, inauspicious and destructive ideas that we can find in every film, every book, and every newspaper, whatever the source. Somehow people want to take up the challenge to become the evil force themselves. People have now to decide if they want to stop this democratic derailment by understanding what must be done. The progress that the West is proud of is towards complete destruction, as human beings have the freedom to achieve heaven or go to hell and also they have the tremendous power of rationality to justify their doom.</font>"<br />
