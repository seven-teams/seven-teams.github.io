"Sahaja Yoga is very difficult for the Jains. If the Jains come into Sahaja Yoga they are very difficult people. Because their traditions are very shallow. The people of Ārya Samāj are very shallow people.<br />
Similarly the Buddhists: they believe in the formless but not as far as God is concerned.<br />
<font color="red">Look at this, 'We do not know Buddha. We do not know Muhammad. We have not seen Them. We do not know Mahāvīra. We do not know anyone [of Them]. Who gave us Self-realization? Śhrī Mātājī. That we were able to know because of Śhrī Mātājī.'</font><br />

It is thus that the human beings constitute the best reflectors of the Creator. <font color="red">Some of them as sages, like Lord Buddha, Jesus Christ, Lord Mahavir, mark the destination of human progress,</font> others as scientist discover the mighty forces of creation which are being constantly harnessed in the service of man.

"All the religions from ancient times have said that a man or a woman has to cleanse their mind through religious activity, with righteous thinking. The aim of every religion was to establish balance in every way to make way for the ascent of the seeker. <font color="red">The Second Birth, Walīhood, Selfhood, Buddha's State, Jaini State, Gnostic, or Ātma-sākṣhātkār, are all names for Self-realization.</font> It was all right in the olden days, where people wanted to be good and to ascend. They obeyed and tried to do whatever was asked for by the Saints, Prophets or Incarnations.<br />
......<br />
On the whole, if you see, Western culture denies Christ who sacrificed his life for the sins of the people. Those who call themselves Christians indulge in all kinds of activities which are anti-Christ. When Christ came into this world in the Realm of Divinity, one had to go through penance (tapasyā). <font color="red">Buddha and Mahāvīra had to do the same at that time.</font> Christians do not know what is penance and they cannot sacrifice even a pin for others. They are very good at lip service. Big conferences are held in the developing nations for monetary help, who pay for these conferences and the outcome is that nothing can be done for the poor countries while Westerners spend their superfluous money on all kinds of waste.<br />
......<br />
Now, a few words about Buddhism. <font color="red">Lord Buddha talked about compassion, compassion and compassion. He bore all the troubles of those days and at the end of his life he was in a very bad financial condition and ultimately he died in a very remote corner of India. Lord Buddha's life has been really ideal but people believe that you cannot attain spiritual ascent unless and until you suffer like Him and give up everything the way He had given it up.</font> The ascetic concept is that one has to give up the family, one has to give up money, property, all possessions, one has to give up the normal life that one leads and has to be an absolute celibate in order to move on the spiritual path. But there are Buddhists and Buddhists. Most of their different forms are lost in ritualism or mental meditation. The Japanese follow the Zen system without understanding anything about it. <font color="red">They have built a beautiful temple of Buddha in Bodhi Gayā where Buddha got his Nirvāṇa.</font> When Genghis Khān invaded Behar, the Buddhist monks did not resort to violence and died. Another style of Buddhism is that of the Japanese who had to learn a lesson through the extreme suffering of Hiroshima.<br />
The Dalai Lamas preach nonviolence, but they have been very money or gold-oriented people. In Beijing, one can see thousands of gold plates and gold beer mugs with Pali inscriptions in the secret vaults. It is said they were rescued from a river by the Chinese soldiers who went after Mister [Dalai] Lama and his followers who were running away to India and who dumped part of the gold they were carrying in the river. This was rescued and put in the museum. They wear saffron clothes to show that they are saṃnyāsīs but live like lords in Dharmaśhālā. I met such a Canadian saṃnyāsī in Canada and he told me that he had no other clothes but these. He said he lost all his property to Dalai Lama who begs all over the world. In Dharmaśhālā, there was a great protest against these very aggressive Dalai Lama's people, but many Governments have sympathy for this money-oriented (gold-oriented), spiritual head, so to pacify these ignorant Governments, who do not discriminate between truth and hypocrisy, the protesters had to ask for forgiveness.<br />
As it is, India has a large load of refugees and they cannot afford to have these gold-oriented saṃnyāsīs which have created a diplomatic rift between China and India. There are Buddhists in Nepal who believe in black magic. Many seekers go to Nepal and get lost. Buddhist Lamas are of many kinds. Some of them have monasteries where to raise the Kuṇḍalinī the seekers are beaten on the spinal cord till their backs are broken. In China they also worship Mother Mercy, Kuan Yin [Guānyīn], who was a Chinese Incarnation. <font color="red">Lord Buddha has given three mantras to chant: to surrender to Lord Buddha or a realized Soul; surrender to dharma (morality); surrender to collectivity.</font> They use a noisy wail to chant mantras. <font color="red">Like all other religious Incarnations he has talked of "Maitreya", is a future Buddha who will give liberation. "Maitreya" means that three Mothers together will incarnate to give Nirvāṇa.</font>"<br />

But His name was Jesus also, that is because He was also the Son of Rādhā. <font color="red">Rādhā thought that, 'Till today nowhere the name of Jaśhodā was mentioned.'

<b>Version 1:</b><br />  
"Do read Devī Māhātmyam or Devī Bhāgavat[am]. Go through the description of Śhrī Mahāviṣhṇu in it. It is described that Śhrī Rādhājī prepared Her Son similarly as Śhrī Pārvatī did it but the main principle in this is Śhrī Gaṇeśha Principle and the Son prepared as Śhrī Gaṇeśha came in the world as Jesus Christ.<br />
<font color="red">Because Christ was prepared by Rādhājī so He got the name Christ in the name of Kṛiṣhṇa and Yeśhu in the name of Yaśhodā.</font> In this way, She manifested the Gaṇeśha Principle in the form of Śhrī Christ."<br />
<br />
<b>Version 2:</b><br />
Nowadays nobody reads Mārkaṇḍeya, but if you can get it, read the description of Śhrī Mahāviṣhṇu.<br />
He has mentioned that Rādhā had created Her own Son by Herself. Means just as Pārvatī created Her Son, She too had created [Hers].<br />
But Gaṇeśh Tattwa is the base for it. And based on Gaṇeśh Tattwa, the Son She had created, He came in this world as Christ.<br />
<font color="red">Now Christ. As Rādhā had created Him, He is called Christ in the name of Kṛiṣhṇa and as Yaśhodā is there, hence Yeśhu.</font><br />
In this way She has positioned the Gaṇeśh Tattwa in the form of Christ.<br />

"Now, if you study the etymology of the word Christ, you would know that the word has originated from a corrupted form of word Kṛiṣhṇa.<br />
As a matter of fact, the Father of Jesus Christ is Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. That is why He is called Christ.<br />
The manner in which His name Jesus originated is also very interesting. <font color="red">The mother of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, Śhrī Yaśhodā Mātā, was addressed as Yesu. Even today, we notice that in northern Indian somebody named Yeśhu is not addressed as such but as Jesu. It is therefore clear, that from Yaśhodā came the word Yeśhu and then further became the word Jesu, and finally the name Jesus Christ.</font>"<br />

"Ādi Viṣhṇu's eighth form was as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa during the Dwāpara Yuga, and again Ādi Śhakti took three forms. Mahākālī lived for a very short time as Viṣhṇumāyā, the infant sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. <font color="red">She was actually born as the daughter of Yeśhodā, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's foster mother, and was killed by the demon Kaṃsa.</font> She later took birth as Draupadī, wife of the Pāṇḍavas. <font color="red">Yeśhodā was Herself an Incarnation of Mahāsaraswatī.</font> As Mahālakṣhmī She took two forms, Rādhā and Rukmiṇī. '<i>Rā</i>' means power or energy and '<i>dhā</i>' means sustenance, so the name 'Rādhā' means the one who sustains the power. As Rukmiṇī She became Queen to Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, the King in Dvārakā.<br />
......<br />
Rādhā in Mary's Incarnation wanted to give Her Son the name of Her Lord, Kṛiṣhṇa. Kṛiṣhṇa comes from '<i>kṛiṣhi</i>' + '<i>\it ṇa</i>'. '<i>Kṛiṣhi</i>' means farming, '<i>ṇa</i>' means the one who carries. So the name 'Christ' came from the 'kṛiṣhi' in Kṛiṣhṇa. <font color="red">The name Jesus was derived from Jasodā, a form of Yeśhodā, the foster mother of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. Rādhā also wanted to give Yeśhodā's name to Her Son because of Yeśhodā's devotion and worship of Her in Vṛindāvan and Gokul. The abbreviation of Yeśhodā was 'Jesu' or 'Yesu', so Rādhā/Mary named Her Son Jesus Christ.</font>"<br />

After that Zoroaster who came three times on the Earth, He was also His Incarnation.<br />
After that Muhammad Sāhab, who was His Incarnation.<br />
And when He was asked that, "Bhāī [Brother], there must have been others also before You," then He replied, "Yes, there [was] a Muhammad." Then again He was asked who was before Him. He replied, "There was one Muhammad."<br />
Muhammad means Praise, the One who is praised, the One who deserves to be praised and is the One who is Redeemer of the world.<br />
They were all Muhammads, They were all Dattātreyas, who came on Earth regularly.<br />
After that [was] Nāṇaka, Guru Nāṇaka. If you ever read His teachings, if you read His talks then you will be surprised that He has always talked in a Sahaja. He has said, "Sahaja Samādhi lago." He has said, "Kāhe re ban khojan jāe, Sarab nivāsī sadā alepā tohī saṃg[a] samāī, Puṣhpamadhya jo bāsa basata hai mukara māhī jaise chhāī, Taise hī harī base niraṃtara ghaṭa hī khojo bhāī." ["Why to go to forest to find Him, He is always there with you just like there is a fragrance in a flower and just as the reflection is there in a mirror, in the same way God is residing in you eternally, seek Him within."] He is just inside, achieve Him just inside. We are just singing poem, singing songs, we are just cramming His prescription.<br />
The talk of seeking this Absolute Principle, residing just inside the heart, has been made since ancient times by these Ādi Gurus, who are incarnated on this Earth again and again.<br />

Now just look at Gaganagaḍ Mahārāj, it is true that he cured many people, but the problem is that his fingers moved inside like a telescope and those of feet also.

He has not yet seen Me in this lifetime. But from many years he knew about Me. He is elder to Me. He began to say, "Mother, I have been waiting for you for many years.

But we people do not have any knowledge of this, and no one tells us about it, nor it is mentioned in any of our books.

<font color="red">And that is why all the Gurus, right from Ādināth, or you can say Ādi Guru, up to, you can say, Moses and [A]braham and Muhammad Sāhab and all these people, have been so particular on this poaint ... point that even Muhammad Sāhab said, "Supposing there are too many women, then you can marry four times."</font> Doesn't mean that every Muslim should marry.

He came onto this Earth to teach people the secrets of the Divine, to reveal God, and to help them cross the Ocean of Illusion themselves within their own identity. Evolution could not go further in the hands of human beings who were in the bondage of ignorance, so they were given guidance through this Incarnation of the Primordial Master (Ādi Guru) again and again in different lives. He was created as the three-headed child, Dattātreya, by Ādi Śhakti who appeared on Earth during the Tretā Yuga as Satī Anasūyā, wife of the Sage Atreya. <font color="red">He was born as Ādināth who founded Jainism -- one of the oldest religions.</font> Then he was born as Rāja Janaka, father of Jānakī also called Sītā, Rāma's wife. She was an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti.<br />
The Primordial Master was also born as Macchindranāth, and again as Zoroaster who was worshiped by the ancient Persians, and still revered by Parsis. Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism. In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates. He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā). Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918. Altogether there were ten major Avatāras of Dattātreya."<br />

They forget everything and don't study or understand. Now, how much knowledge of music they have in Maharashtra. There is lot of literature of Saints in Marathi language. But who reads such books now?<br />
They purchase dirty books from the street and read. Very superficial things ... not going deeper but floating on top. This is the condition of Yuva [young] generation.<br />
If it continues then they all will be lost. They will become useless.<br />

So, She ... She resides as a pure relationship of these Gurus.<br />
Thus, the Mahālakṣhmī's greatest ... greatness is that: through Her Power only the Suṣhumṇā is covered by Kuṇḍalinī. She is the power of our evolution. And by Her Power only, we have risen to be human beings, and by Her Son's Power, we are going to become higher people.<br />
Thus the importance of Mahālakṣhmī is very great for all the Sahaja Yogis. Because She guides our Viṣhṇu Tattwa to its culmination, to its completion, which is the Principle of our Evolution. Thus She is a Giver of Dharma, She gives us the dharma, and She is the Giver of the Truth. She's the One who relates us to our brain. The whole brain's system is Mahālakṣhmī's system. So, it is She who exposes the whole of the knowledge as truth to us, on our central nervous system.<br />
But at the State of Virāṭa, when Śhrī Kṛiṣh... uh ... when Viṣhṇu becomes the Virāṭa, the Great Primordial Being, then She is called as Virāṭaṅganā, as His Power.<br />

"Now this sisterly relationship existed in other Incarnations also. Like Muhammad Sāhab had a sisterly relationship ... uh-uh-uh ... with, actually, what we have to say, that: His sister as such was ʿAlī's wife, but She was born to Him as a daughter.<br />
<font color="DarkRed">So, They can be born as a daughter or as the sister. She was born as Nāṇaka's sister, Nāṇakī. She was born as the daughter of Muhammad Sāhab. So, it could be a sister or could be the daughter of an Incarnation.</font><br />
But daughter and sister are innocent, pure chastity.<br />
Now think of it: that those people who cannot understand the importance of chastity, how can they talk of any laws whatsoever? Because laws means maryādās. And it has the proper sense through the Power of Viṣhṇumāyā."<br />

"So when we read about the Devī, about Her Incarnations -- how She came on this Earth to save Her bhaktas, people who were trying to ascend, to cross this Bhavasāgara, how She worked hard, how She fought the devils, how She cough... She killed the demons, single-handed -- She took upon Herself the responsibility of making the people cross the Bhavasāgara.<br />
Guru gave you the strength to have dharma but She is the One who brought you out. Even those who were dhārmik could not do it because of the demonic pressure. She's the One who fought, single-handed, with Her Powers of destruction. In Her Love for you She fought. She brought you to this level.<br />
<font color="DarkRed">And then She took a milder form of Incarnation. Even during the time of all the Gurus, She took the Form of, as you know: Jānakī was the daughter of Janaka, then Fāṭimah was the daughter of Muhammad Sāhab, and Nāṇakī was the sister of Nāṇaka.

Firstly, the Principle of Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī is very close with a Guru ... a relation of plenty of love and purity. Now if we see from the beginning with all the Ādi Gurus, She was born to them as a daughter or as a sister. Like the daughter of Janaka was Śhrī Sītā: She was the form of Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī, was the Principle of Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī. Sītā was Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī, and She was the daughter of Janaka. Then the sister of Śhrī Nāṇaka, Nāṇakī, She was Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī. Her relation was of sister. In the same way, the daughter of Muhammad Sāhib, Fāṭimah, She was Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī. After Her, Rādhā: Rādhā was the form of Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī. After Her, Mary: Mary was Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī, and Her relation was of purity. She was so pure that with Her purity She gave birth to Śhrī Christ. So She was a form of complete pure Virgin. And as She was a form of Virgin, because of Her purity She got a Son pure as Christ.

<b>Sahaja Yogi:</b> The Goddess Kuan Yen [Guānyīn], Śhrī Mātājī, ...<br />
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> Yes.<br />
<b>Sahaja Yogi:</b> ... can You tell us something about it [Her]?<br />
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> <font color="DarkRed"> Kuan Yin [Guānyīn]?</font><br />
<b>Another Sahaja Yogi:</b> Kuan Yin [Guānyīn]!<br />
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> <font color="DarkRed">Yes? You want to know about Her?<br />
That's an Incarnation of one of the ... yuh ... I mean in the Chinese mythology you find the Incarnation described of Kuan Yin [Guānyīn]. And actually, She is the One, who is the Vṛuddhā, is described as Vṛuddhā, She is the One, is the Aged One. Uh-uh-uh because uh Kuan Yin [Guānyīn] was born to a king. She was the daughter of a king. And She was the Virgin Form of the Goddess, and She would not marry. So Her father got very angry with Her, that She is not marrying. And he threatened Her, because he had arranged Her ... His marri... uh marriage with some great king, you see. And when the marriage took pla... mariage did not take place, father was so angry and annoyed and felt very humiliated. So, he-ee took Her to a hillside and got ... said ... threatened [Her] that, "I will throw You down." And actually She was thrown down from the hillside into a valley, and he thought, 'She must have been dead.'<br />
But there was a tiger, which held Her, and he carried Her along, and then he looked after Her. And when She grew very old, quite old, then She came out of Her hermitage. And She started prea... treating people. And many people got cured by Her.<br />
But She was quite old, then the father recognized Her. Because father was sick. She went and treated the father also. And She started curing people.<br />
And that's the Kuan Yin [Guānyīn].<br />
Uh-uh-uh if you go to Hong Kong, you can see Her statue: the face is very much like Mine, absolutely. But She is older looking, and Her uh shoulders are bent, quite bent.<br />
But She came much before Christ.<br />
And the uh-uh-uh ... the Buddhist felt that, 'People wouldn't give Her up, because She was so much regarded as the Mother of Mercy.' So, they included Her in the Buddha uh-uh-uh thing.</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> We have Chinese also who are very wise. And the ... they are known to be people of deep understanding. But they are not like Indians.<br />
So, what is lacking in all these people is: the depth of awareness. <font color="DarkRed">Because-ss, though in China also Mother of Mercy came, and She really uh-uh-uh bestowed blessings upon them, and China rose also, afterwards, into her own glory and became quite a good industrial, I mean developed country, we can say, very powerful, but still, that kind of regimentation could not be borne. Because, after all, Mother Mercy was there.</font><br />
<font color="DarkRed"><font color="DarkRed">Do you know last -- you have one Mother Mercy to give ... you have given Me ...</font><br />

<b>Version 1 :</b>
I mean to say that the Sopānamārga, which is Suṣhumṇā Path, the central path, is the Path of Lord Viṣhṇu. Through this path we attain the Śhiva Tattwa. So Śhiva Tattwa is the destination and the Path is made by Lord Viṣhṇu.<br />
This central path is the creation of Lord Viṣhṇu and the Ādi Śhakti. Lord Śhiva has no role in it: He sits comfortably in His Seat, without bothering for anybody. If someone wishes to come, may come.<br />
To attain Śhiv Tattwa we should go through this Viṣhṇu Path and correct all the centers that are created on it. When the centers are cleansed, the Viṣhṇu Path opens up and our ascent begins.<br />
<br />
<b>Version 2 :</b>
"Meaning that the Sopānamārga which has been created, which we call as Suṣhumṇā nāḍī, which is central path, is the Path of Lord Viṣhṇu. And through this Path we attain the Śhiva Tattwa. So Śhiva Tattwa is the destination to Śhiva, and the Path is made by Lord Viṣhṇu.<br />
To create this Path, Viṣhṇujī and Ādi Śhakti have taken efforts. Lord Shiva has no role in it: He sits comfortably in His Seat, not bothering about anyone who comes or doesn't come.<br />
So, to attain this Śhiv Tattwa, we should go through this Viṣhṇu Path."<br />

Because thirteen, fourteen thousand years back Mārkaṇḍeya has described about Kuṇḍalinī. Then came ... Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya has described about Kuṇḍalinī.<br />

Thus, it continued till the twelfth century, when a very great poet called Gyāneśhwara, He started ...<br />
[Aside:] It's all right. [Laughs.] It's all right. [Drinks water.]<br />
He started, in a way, writing about Gītā.<br />
<font color="DarkRed">He requested His brother, who was His Guru, Nivṛittināth, that, "Please allow Me to write about Kuṇḍalinī because in the Gītā it is not mentioned. We must write about it!" So He allowed.</font><br />
And He wrote it in the sixth chapter of that Gyāneśhwarī.<br />
But people said ... the people who were in charge of the religion, that time, said: "This chapter is something to be condemned." Because they didn't know how to awaken the Kuṇḍalinī. "This has to be absolutely condemned, and nobody should read this one." Niṣhiddha is the word, is not so bad as it's condemned, but niṣhiddha: is not to be read.<br />
Thus, all this knowledge, of the inner be-ing, was kept in the darkness. And this knowledge of the inner being, not known to us, created the problem."<br />

"But in the center we had another great movement which is called as Nāth, Nāth Pānthis. They say it came from Śhiva, but whatever it is: it came from Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], and these people, and got diverted into many types.<br />
But those who remained in the middle, one of them was, we should say, was called Gahinināth. <font color="DarkRed">And his disciple was Nivṛuttināth, the elder brother of Gyānadeva.</font><br />
It is amazing, if you read anything about them, they know all about chakras, they know all about these, all three channels. Everything they new thousands of years back.<br />
Then somehow or other, they didn't tell people. They kept the knowledge to themselves.<br />
I can't say why they did it but they did.<br />
<font color="DarkRed">Ultimately, Gyānadeva took permission of His Guru, Nivṛittināth, and said that, "I, let Me tell you ... at least let Me tell others. You allow Me. Because people should know what works it out." So He wrote about Kuṇḍalinī.</font><br />
But if you read these ancient books, you will be amazed that the whole thing was described in those books: how you get your Realization, and how then we have those centers, which are to be enlightened, what problems come in.<br />
But the method they employed, [laughing:] for achieving it, was really hazardous again.<br />
I don't know why they had to do it but they did it.<br />
They were all unmarried people and very strict with themselves and they had to lead a life very secluded from the society.<br />
This was really a very difficult type of ascent they had.<br />
When I read about them I'm really is ... feel very, extremely sad, that all these great people who were seeking had to go through such horrible strenuous turmoil for days together, and then s-s-some of them got Realization."<br />
