"<font color="red">As you must have heard of Rāja Balī [Mahābalī or Māveli] when Vāmana Avatār occurred. Rāja Balī was said to be religious person.</font> [<b>Variant:</b> <font color="red">You must have heard about king Bali when Vāmana Incarnation took place. Rāja Balī was a religious person.</font>] But he did Yagñya.<br />
For getting creative powers people do Yagñya.<br />
......<br />
If we acquire it without the shadow of dharma, then it can also have a negative impact as in Rāja Balī.<br />
When Viśhwāmitra asked Rāja Balī to do tapa, he asked Brahmadev to grant a wish that he can destroy all the Devas.<br />
<font color="red">After that, you know Vāmana Incarnation took place. About Vāmana Incarnation we know that our powers in the middle, which we call Sattvaguṇa Powers, which are Powers of Lord Viṣhṇu, the powers because of which we became humans from amoeba, that power took Incarnation to restore the balance.</font><br />

<font color="red">"Just as fish still exist today, elephants too, some evolution continues slowly. We can say that up to seven evolutions [it continues].<br />
The first evolution was when the Supreme Being had to be in human form, which was the Vāmana Avatār, a small man. He first showed that humans can conquer all [the] three realms. It means that humans can conquer the five elements. This is the Vāmana Avatār."</font><br />

Like first the fish: It came as a fish. They say, when Noah was having a bad time with the deluge, this fish helped him. They came as an Incarnation, that aspect of God which we call as evolutionary. That came as a fish on this Earth, and then, then It came as a quadruped. Then It came as a short man. That It came as a strong man. And on and on and on like that till we reached a stage where the top one, you can see, or here. This is the stage where Śhrī Rām, who came eight thousand years back.

"But there is another guidance which has come to us from God. This is very much believed into in India. Even in the Western world, if they follow Christianity or Judaism, they believe in it. It is believed that [pointing to the Chakra Chart:] at that spot is, resides the Power of God which evolves.<br />
<font color="red">This area, according to Indian mythology, is governed by a Power called Lakṣhmī, which on one side gives us our sustainance [sustenance] and on the other side guides it [us] how to behave.<br />
And from the same Power, the Male Form of that Power incarnates, again and again, to guide the people, in human form.<br />
This Incarnation in the beginning was a fish, when we were fishes. When we were tortoises, It was a tortoise, when we were reptiles It was a tortoise. Then we were quadrupeds, we ... It was a boar. Then later on It became half man and half uh half lion. Then It became a small man, short man. Then It became the very strong man, Paraśhurāma. Then He came as Śhrī Rāma.

"And Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa incarnated as one of the Incarnations of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, who is responsible for our evolutionary process.<br />
It is only through Śhrī Viṣhṇu that we evolve. He is the aspect which gives us dharma: dharma is our sustainance [sustenance]. Through changing our sustainances [sustenances] or our capacities we have evolved.<br />

"So this center, we come to, of our evolution, is presided by the Preserver, the aspect of preservation: He's the Father who looks after us, He's the One who gives us our well-being. He comes on this Earth again and again, in different forms. According to Indian Purāṇas, the Ark of Noah was saved by a fish, which was a dolphin. And this dolphin fish was this aspect which incarnated. Then the second aspect came as the tortoise. Then the third as a quadruped.<br />
Like that they have described the evolution, how these Incarnations had to come to break the barriers of the evolutionary ignorance.

"So, at the time, first time the Incarnation as a human being came on this Earth, as we say of this sustainance [sustenance], was of Śhrī Rāma.<br />
<font color="red">But before that was uh-uh Vāmana Avatāra, which is the short man, a very short [man]. I mean, first the man was created as a short man. He is the first one as Vāmana Avatāra. And that One came as a leader, the first one was Vāmana Avatāra, and He was given the power ... He was given the blessings that He can spread into three worlds: so, into, into the higher worlds, into the lower worlds, and into the central world.<br />
That's how human beings uh got distributed into these three worlds. And a big, you see, problem started.<br />
Like the house that moves wild, you know. Then it goes amok. Then you have to get all the things collected, put them right.<br />
The original sin is the big problem. The biggest problem was that.<br />
Now to solve it up, one had to do all these things.<br />
So first the Vāmana Avatāra came.</font><br />
<font color="red">After the Vāmana Avatāra came the Incarnation of a very tall and a hefty man. That was Paraśhurāma.</font> That I don't know, in the Greek philosophy, if Zeus was Paraśhurāma, because it sounds like Zeus. Because Paraśhurāma is contemporary of Rāma Himself. Because somebody had to announce. You see, it is necessary that somebody must announce the Advent, at that time it was necessary. So Paraśhurāma came. The tall and a hefty man, who came on this Earth, maybe Zeus is called. I mean they are so confused that, you see, to ... to relate this to that, is another confusion. I don't know how.

"On the right-hand side also, was another one, where the wives, you see, the dedicated wives, devotees, uh devoted wives, you see, as called as Satī.<br />
Now, one are known as Yatis, another are Satīs. So, the ones who tried to find out about uh-uh-uh element-ts, and overpower the elements and all those things, they ... they were Yatis, and the ones who tried to find out about uh ... sorts of mast... have a mastery with their willpower, you see, were the devoted women. They too master the elements very much.<br />
Though the devoted women are regarded even higher than uh Yatis. You know, Satīs are higher than Satīs [Yatis] ... uh-uhh uh Satīs are called as the-ee ... uh the ... Sanskrit it's a ucchatar [higher]: they are much higher than the Yatis. So their achievements were uh-uh-uh much more in dimension. Because what they had ... had used their bhakti also, because they were dedicated to their husbands.<br />
<font color="red">One of them you can say was Rāvaṇa's wife, to take it foy ... for example, was Rāvaṇa's wife. She was so powerful! Such a powerful woman She was. Of course, She was Mahākālī Herself. So, that you give ... you can imagine: She was the Mahākālī Force Herself. But She was a Satī as She came. So She had a Sahaja Samādhi. She had the Sahaja uh Power.</font><br />
But there are many Satīs who achieves [achieve] Satī Power.<br />
<font color="red">But I'll describe this Lady, you see, this Satī, Mandodarī She was, Rāvaṇa's wife.</font><br />
<font color="red">Now, when She married him -- She had to marry though She was Mahākālī, there's also a big story. Uh-uh-uh, if I go through that story also is very interesting. Can tell you later on about it.<br />
So She was married to him.<br />
And when Rāvaṇa, you see, uh-uh-uh s... was fighting Rāma, She was the Satī and She ... She was a de... devotee of Śhrī Viṣhṇu. And She always used to worship Śhrī Viṣhṇu.<br />
So She threw Her kaṅkaṇ</font> [bracelet of thread used in Pūjās] -- this is the kaṅkaṇ. It's call as kaṅkaṇ, you see. See this one?<br />
[After a Sahaja Yogi says something:] [<font color="orange">unclear</font>]. See now.<br />
[After a Sahaja Yogi says something:] Very interesting, very interesting.<br />
[After a Sahaja Yogi says, "Mh-hm,":] Kaṅkaṇ.<br />
[After a Sahaja Yogi says, "Mh,":] You see, not easy to make.<br />
[After a Sahaja Yogi says, "Yeah.":] [<font color="orange">unclear</font>].<br />
[After two Sahaja Yogis say something:] You see.<br />
Be careful, [<font color="orange">unclear</font>].<br />
[<font color="orange">unclear</font>].<br />
[After a Sahaja Yogi says something:] You see? You see, she came out.<br />
<font color="red">So, all these ... uh ... this kaṅkaṇ, you know, She threw it in the air. And Rāma's ... ah-ah-uh arrows were coming, and they would return back to Rāma.</font><br /> 
Because Rāma cannot cross beyond the Powers of a Satī also. He has to respect her [a Satī in general].<br />
<font color="red">Because She was the devotee of Rāma, first of all, and of which, you know, that Kālī is the sister of a ... Umā is the sister of ...</font><br />
[After a Sahaja Yogi says, "Viṣhṇu,":] <font color="red">... Viṣhṇu. So, you see, how can He kill the whuh ... husband of ...</font><br />
[After a Sahaja Yogi interrupts, "Sister":] <font color="red">... the sister?</font><br />
You see, all of these points are there.<br />
<font color="red">And the kaṅkaṇa was in the air, is projective. Everything failed. You see, nothing would go, even Sudarśhan Chakra wouldn't go that side.</font><br />
[After a Sahaja Yogi says, "Mh,":] So, Lakṣhmaṇa said, "What are you doing‽ What is it? You are getting back your, all your arrows! Why don't you control your arrows? You see what to do. See there, what is there." <font color="red">He saw this kaṅkaṇa was moving there.</font> He said, "Oh, God! Now, you have it. If this is the thing to work out, then am I useless?" Poor Lakṣhmaṇa was sitting very much in frustration.<br />
Then Yama, the God of Death, he thought: "The time is coming and what is this kaṅkaṇ doing here? You see, so must try to solve this problem." [Sahaja Yogi laughs.]<br />
So, He is the clever one.<br />
<font color="red">He ... he went into the heart of ... uh-uh-uh or He went into the mind of Rāvaṇa, and told him: "Oh, you are not uh the one who is winning the war, it is your wife's anger."</font> And, oh, his ego was challenged. [During laughter:] [<font color="orange">unclear</font>], <font color="red">"Kaṅkaṇ</font> [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] <font color="red">you see in the air, you see that</font> [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] <font color="red">is there. That is the one that is protecting you." Very angry: "What does She mean by challenging my manliness?"</font><br />
See, so he went down to his palace.<br />
<font color="red">And he saw She ... She was sitting there smiling. She said: "I know you will come back." He said: "What do You mean? I cannot fight the war? You think I live by Your powers? Will You please get ... get back your kaṅkaṇa? It's my order!"</font><br />
So, as a Satī you have to obey the orders of your husband, you see.<br />
[After a Sahaja Yogi says, "Mh,":]  <font color="red">She said, "All right. I will take it back." She took [it] back, you see.</font><br />
So, [as the Sahaja Yogi laughs:] but you can find out loopholes, you see. That is, that's the [<font color="orange">unclear</font>]. [Everyone laughs.]<br /> 
<font color="red">So, She said, "Now, I've taken back My kaṅkaṇ." All right. Then She sat before Viṣhṇu. She said, "How dare You kill My husband? I will not eat food till he comes back here alive, I will not eat."</font><br />
Now, Viṣhṇu had a problem. Now what to do? He cannot kill, Rāma being Viṣhṇu, you see. [Another Sahaja Yogi laughs.] He cannot kill Rāvaṇa. Now He said, "What to do?" So He told Lakṣhmaṇa: "It's a big problem!"<br />
<font color="red">So Lakṣhmaṇa informed Yama: "Again the problem has come</font> [same Sahaja Yogi laughs]<font color="red">: She won't eat food till [he laughs again] ... Rā-ah ... Her husband goes back, you know."</font> <font color="red">So Yama said, "I know it's very dangerous, but I have to try this trick otherwise I'm in for trouble. This man has to die, for the time has come." So, Yama said, "It's a very big risk of ... to say this to Satī."</font><br />
<font color="red">You see: one woman fighting all this [he laughs again], with Her will Power.</font><br />
"It's all right." He says, "All right. I will manage it."<br />
He took the form of a ... of Rāvaṇa himself. He became, took, started looking like Rāvaṇa.<br />
<font color="red">And He went there, and He stood up in the door. And he said: "Now, see, I have come now." [She] said: "Did you win the war?" She [he] said, "Yes!" She said, "All right." "Now, will You eat Your food?" And the food was lying before Her. And She made a mistake there: She ate the food.</font><br />
Before your husband has taken the food you are not supposed to eat your food. You see, that's why Indian women will never eat it. [Sahaja Yogi laughs.] Because this gives them power, you see. To be [a] dedicated wife means power.<br />
So, they do not mind, even if their husbands are bad, even if they are rākṣhasas, they are anything: they will be dedicated to their husbands. They'll love them. So that they keep their own powers, and by that they save their husbands' also.<br />
<font color="red">So he stood up there, and [<font color="orange">unclear</font>], "You eat Your food."<br />
As soon as She ate the food, you see, uh not even She ate the first morsel, Rāvaṇa's head was cut. And the head fell at the feet of a ...</font><br />
[After a Sahaja Yogi says, "Mh-hm,":] <font color="red">... Mandodarī.<br />
And then, you know, he, Yama came in his own form. And She cursed him that, "You will be a dog in the next life." And He became a dog, in the next life. He has to become that.</font><br />
So they are so powerful.<br />
<font color="red">But this I'm telling you about someone who was uh uh sort of a Sahaja Sāmarthya [Spontaneous Power], [<font color="orange">unclear</font>].</font><br />
[After a Sahaja Yogi interrupts, "Which dog was this, Mother?":] Hah?<br />
[After the Sahaja Yogi says, "Which dog? This wasn't the dog which accompanied Yudhiṣhṭhira,":] Of course!<br />
[Overlapping with a Sahaja Yogis]: Who else?<br />
Yes!<br />
[After a Sahaja Yogi laughs and says, "That's the Yudhiṣhṭhira who released Yama from this,":] You see, actually, it is uh, Rāv... after Rāma, you see, whatever curses and everything went carried on during the time of Kṛiṣhṇa.<br /> 
[After a Sahaja Yogi says, "Acchā,":] So he is the same dog!<br />
[After a Sahaja Yogi says, "Mh,":]  The one who followed Yudhiṣhṭhira, you see.<br />
[After a Sahaja Yogi says, "Mh-hm,":] Near ... Dharmarāja means ...<br />

"And if you get the Powers like Me, then what to say? Then you all will sit and obtain everything [<b>Variant:</b> And if you get the Powers like Me, then what is there to say? Just sitting you will do everything.]<br />
Meaning, if I don't like something, I will not fight for it but make arrangements that such a thing does not occur only [laughter], by itself.<br />
So either you all should obtain such Śhaktis, but stay in pure Śhakti, not that for some time you become a man or for some time become a woman, it cannot happen then. [Laughter.]<br />
Women should live with their feminine power, like here we believe in Satī's power. Then you can see that just sitting in one place you can make people run around. You have to be in its glory.<br />
We used to consider Satī's power greater than Yati's. Even Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's Mūrti was considered less than of a Satī.<br />
She [Gāṃdhārī, the mother of the 100 Kauravas killed during the Mahābhārata War] told [after the War] when He was cursed, "You will die, the entire Yaduvaṃśh will die," He completely honored the curse because it was from a Satī.<br />
<font color="red">In front of a</font> [pointing with Her left index finger to the right bracelet:] <font color="red">kaṅkaṇ from Mandodarī, even the arrow of Śhrī Rāma would return.<br />

"There were so many stories about Sadāśhiva giving a eh-eh ... blessing to people, even to Rāvaṇa, which is a very interesting story about Rāvaṇa. That Rāvaṇa did lots of penance.<br />
I don't know what he did, how much he must have starved with his ten heads, [as laughter starts:] and what [laughs], I mean, if one mouth is there you feel so hungry, with [as laughter starts:] ten mouths, you see! [Smiles.] I don't know what he must have done to-oo do that kind of a penance that Śh-śhiva just got fed up, you see.<br />
His Compassion is so great, He thought, 'Let this man have whatever he likes.'<br />
So, Rāvaṇa went to Śhiva, and the Śhiva said, "What do you want? Why are you doing all this to yourself?" So, he said that uh: "I want to have a blessing." He said, "What blessing?" "First You promise, that, whatever I ask for, you will give me." He said, "Of course. If it is in My power, I'll give."<br />
It's a very interesting story.<br />
So, he said, "I want to have Your wife." Because he knew His wife is Ādi Śhakti. And, if he gets the Ādi Śhakti as a partner with him, he can do wonders. So he asked that, "I should get Your wife as my partner."<br />
Now, it was very difficult, you see, for Him [laughing:] to take such a decision: to give in to this devil. But in compassion, He did it.<br />
And all these events, you see, really show that how His Compassion works out things.<br />
As a result, ah-ah-ah-oh it was decided that the His wife, Pārvatī, had to go with this horrible fellow.<br />
But Pārvatī's sister [brother] was Śhrī Vi... Viṣhṇu, that is, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, and He said uh-uh-uh to Himself: that, 'I can't allow My sister to go with this devil. I must do something about it.'<br />
The most mischievous one is Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br />
So what He did: was to make him feel like going for the bathroom. So he felt shy, He put the Lady on one side, and he went to the bathroom.<br />
Now, uh-uh-uh Śhiva had warned him: that, "You'd better be careful because this Mother Earth is the Mother of this Lady, and never put Her on the Mother Earth. You must uh carry Him [Her] all the time on your back."<br />
So when he reached uh-uh-uh certain point this Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa created a mischief, and he felt like going. So he put Her down. As soon as he put Her down, the Mother Earth sucked Her in, and he ... he didn't know what to do.<br />
Second time again he tried. And eoh ... he again went to Śhiva and he said, "See now: this is what You have promised, and this is what is doing." So He said, "I'd warned you: that it ... Her brother is a very mischievous fellow, and He'll, some or other, manage, so you'd better be careful. This time you don't listen to Him. Don't put Her on the ground, whatever it may be."<br />
So this time, he did another uh-uh-uh try, we can say, and carried Her on his back. Suddenly, he found a little boy -- It was Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa Himself -- uh laughing at him. She [he] said, "Why are You laughing at me?" "Oh my! Why are you carrying this old woman on your bo... back? She has no ornaments." He said, "She's the Goddess." He said, "No! She has no ornaments. She's wearing nothing. How can She be the Goddess?"<br />
So, you see, in India that's a ... uh-uh-uh proverb we use. Somebody, some lady who has, who lives without any ornaments or anything, that she's like the Lanka Pārvatī.<br />
So he was carrying Her to Lanka. And the ... when he looked at Her up, he saw a very old woman without any teeth, you know, laughing at him. He got such a fright, he threw Her away. [Laughter.]<br />
That's Mahāmāyā! [More laughter.]<br />
<font color="red">Then the, third situation was, he went and told: that, "You'd better tell Your wife that She's not to listen to anybody, and You'd better see that You give me Your wife Itself." He said: "All right. She'll be born in Lanka, and you can marry Her."<br />
And's, Her name was Mandodarī.</font><br />
Now the great story goes on like that.<br />
<font color="red">But this Mandodarī was the great worshiper of Viṣhṇu. And at the time when Rāma came, you see, to kill him, all this was organized by Mandodarī Herself. Because She know ... knew that, if Śhrī Rāma kills Rāvaṇa, he will get his uh liberation from these ideas about women. The way he was running after uh-uh-uh Sītā and doing all these things, She actually wanted that something should happen that he should take another birth, and he should get rid of these uh-uh-uh notions of uh-uh-uh looking after beautiful women, and the way he brought Sītājī there. She was against it completely, but he would not listen.</font><br />
So the war took place. And in the war, he was killed by Śhrī Rāma.<br />
All this episode came because of the unlimited compassion of Śhrī Śhiva.<br />
His Compassion is, to look at, looks very illogical sometimes. But there's a big logic behind it. The logic is that: whatever He does, brings forth a uh-uh-uh kind of a solution of the problem."<br />

<b>Version 1:</b><br />
"Seeing a widow was considered to be ominous. Ritualistic people do not eat food cooked by a widow.<br />
Our society is unaware of the fact that our Scriptures do not allow such things.<br />
<font color="red">After the death of Rāvaṇa, Śhrī Rāma married Mandodarī, the wife of Rāvaṇa, to Vibhīṣhaṇa.</font><br />
But people say that, 'Śhrī Rāma was all right, yet widows cannot marry.'<br />
Just imagine your own mother, sister or daughter in such a miserable condition! May God save from such a society! It is better not to have such a society and if at all some society is made everyone should have the right to live peacefully in it."<br />
<b>Version 2:</b><br />
To add to this there is a belief that, 'Even seeing a widow would bring bad luck. Must not eat food cooked by a widow.'<br />
This society of ours does not know that this has not been written in any of the Scriptures.<br />
<font color="red">Śhrī Rāma got Mandodarī married to Vibhīṣhaṇa. There are innumerable examples. Śhrī Rāma did this. After the death of Rāvaṇa, Śhrī Rāma got Mandodarī married to Vibhīṣhaṇa.</font><br />
But people say that, 'Up to that it was all right. But other widows cannot marry again.'<br />
Now just think, that if your mother, sister or daughter is pushed into such a circumstance, then God save us from such a samāj [society]. Better there is not any samāj at all. And if there is, then everyone has the right to live a happy and peaceful life.<br />

Ādi Viṣhṇu's eighth form was as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa during the Dwāpara Yuga, and again Ādi Śhakti took three forms. Mahākālī lived for a very short time as Viṣhṇumāyā, the infant sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. She was actually born as the daughter of Yeśhodā, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's foster mother, and was killed by the demon Kaṃsa. She later took birth as Draupadī, wife of the Pāṇḍavas."<br />

The same is the case with Hindu religion. In Hindu religion you cannot be communal at all. Because your various Gurus, Real Gurus like Dattātreya, etc., and Nāth Pānthis, are your many Incarnations and your swayambhus are many. You don't have one book. You have [a] number of books.<br />
Only Jesus and Bible, they can be fundamentalists. And they can be Yahūdīs [Jews] also. And all the three are related to each other. It is written in Books.<br />

Saṅkoch means restraint in a wise way, enlightened restraint -- how far to go is the question."</font><br />

<font color="red">"The Raja Yoga is a derivation of Hathayoga. In this style the of practices the Gurus led a life like kings. They wore clothes like royal personalities and ruled the people. Raja Janaka an incarnation of Primordial Guru was the father of Seeta. In their inner life they were yogis but they led royal life without any attachment. They did not practice Asanas or Pranayamas but they worshiped God by different styles of bowing.<br />
Prophet Mohomed [Muhammad] was the incarnation of the same Primordial Master. He was married four times but in his inner life he was completely detached.<br />
Shri Rama[']s incarnation also took place on the same channel and enlightened the path of Divine Kingship."</font><br />

[Answer to the question, "When this knowledge come to Toy?":] <font color="red">"I knew about it since I was born. I knew about Myself. If I have done anything it is to understand human beings. What's their problem? They follow Christ, they follow Muhammad Sāhab, they follow Rāma, they follow Kṛiṣhṇa, and they follow everything but nothing inside. What is the matter? Nothing penetrates, that was the thing. I thought they were not connected. They are to be connected to all this. Only what I have done is to work out the permutation and combination of human beings. That's not difficult because there are mainly seven chakras one has to work out and how you can raise the Kuṇḍalinī to break the Sahasrāra."</font><br />

<font color="red">"We have come to a place which we call as Brahmapuri here, called, perhaps, maybe because here Śhrī Rāmadāsa, the Guru of Śhivajī Mahārās [Mahārāj], in these deep waters found the statue of Śhrī Rāma, Sītā, Lakṣhmaṇa and Hanumāna together.<br />
Then they were carried from here and put in a temple called Chāphaḷ, the place where I saw that, also.<br />
......<br />
Also we have some miraculous things about Christ and His Mother, that we ... they found a statue of Mother Mary and Christ in one of the shores of Bombay [Mumbai] City, ca...  and  ... called as Worli [locality in central Mumbai and one of the 4 peninsulas], the fisherman found it in their net.<br />
Like Rāmadāsa when He jumped inside this he found it in the river, in the same way.<br />
......<br />
Now today, I am telling you this because Rāmadāsa was the Guru of Śhivajī. And He was the man who was very detached, He was Hanumāna Himself. And once He came to Śhivajī's place and Śhivajī was so fed up with this people and with the whole administration, and the way the things were. He had made a chit, saying that: ``Mh... O, my Guru, I give You all my property, all my lands, all my kingdom, everything at Your Feet and You better look after it." And he [laughing:] put that chit in the ... uh-uh-uh we have the choḷī, you see, in the cloth sort of a thing.<br />
So He stood in the door and read it and he said, ``What? [Laughing:] You've given Me everything?" He said, ``I am a saṃnyāsī, and I don't know administration. But you can do everything ... uh-uh-uh the same way as you have been doing, but be detached about it. And to show that you are detached you must use a ... a ... waist under's ... under dhotī stuff we call it, in a triangular manner, it is made. You see, that thing, with the ... uh saffron color showing that you are detached and you are a saṃnyāsī."<br />
That's how this flag came into being.<br />
So the entry of the politics has been in this country ... uh entry into politics by uh-uh-uh sākṣhātkāri people or by Incarnation has been there.<br />
Most of the Incarnations have been kings. Like uh we have got Buddha, he was a king, Mahāvīra was a prince. Both were prince. Then we have got Rāma who was a king. Then we have got Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa who became a king.<br />
So the aiśhwarya, the king-ness, has to be there. Has to be a royal family. Has to be, Incarnation should be from a royal family. In India it is, that is the concept."</font><br />

<font color="red">"During the Tretā Yuga, at the time of Śhrī Rāma, Ādi Śhakti incarnated in three separate human personalities, expressing Her three aspects:<br />
&emsp;1. Sītā [Jānakī] (Mahālakṣhmī) as the daughter of Rāja Janaka<br />
&emsp;&emsp;This was the first absolute human form (<i>Laukik</i>)"</font><br />

<div class="para-divider"></div>

<p>
<font color="red">"This spiritual awakening in man grew very strong and was again challenged by the evil forces who incarnated to disturb their search through penance (<i>yagonya</i>). At this time, much before the seventh Incarnation of Śhrī Viṣhṇu as Lord Rāma, the Primordial Mother incarnated as the Goddess Durgā, Mother of the Universe. She incarnated from the Primordial Heart Center (Ādi Anāhata Chakra) called the Sacred heart in the Virāṭa. There have been one hundred and eight main Incarnations of the Goddess Durgā to save seekers from the evil of satanic forces.<br />
Maheśha (Śhiva), Viṣhṇu and Brahmadeva form the Trinity which incarnated as one teacher God, the Primordial Master, Dattātreya. He came onto this Earth to teach people the secrets of the Divine, to reveal God, and to help them cross the Ocean of Illusion themselves within their own identity. Evolution could not go further in the hands of human beings who were in the bondage of ignorance, so they were given guidance through this Incarnation of the Primordial Master (Ādi Guru) again and again in different lives. He was created as the three-headed child, Dattātreya, by Ādi Śhakti who appeared on Earth during the Tretā Yuga as Satī Anasūyā, wife of the Sage Atreya. He was born as Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara] who founded Jainism -- one of the oldest religions. Then he was born as Rāja Janaka, father of Jānakī also called Sītā, Rāma's wife. She was an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti.<br />
The Primordial Master was also born as Macchindranāth, and again as Zoroaster who was worshiped by the ancient Persians, and still revered by Parsis. Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism. In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates. He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā). Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918. Altogether there were ten major Avatāras of Dattātreya.<br />
It is very important to understand that until the animal stage there was no need for animals to solve the problem of life, as animals were under the complete command of God. At the human stage, however, as we learn from the history of Adam and Eve, they were given the choice and freedom to solve the problem of life. That was how evolution was to go a step further. Without such freedom human beings were not equipped to learn the secrets of Divine Power.<br />
Ādi Viṣhṇu Himself took His seventh Incarnation during the Tretā Yuga as Lord Rāma, a human being who crossed the Ocean of Illusion and touched a new dimension of awareness. As Śhrī Rāma, Ādi Viṣhṇu came to enlighten human social and political consciousness as the true model of what Plato, thousand of years later, would call 'the philosopher king'. He settled for human beings the rules of socio-political correct action (<i>samāj tatha rājkaraṇ dharma</i>). He also expressed God's aspect of majesty and order within kingship and institutions, and led a life of an ideal human being (<i>Maryādā Puruṣhottama</i>). This was witnessed by multitudes, resulting in a mass awareness for the first time among human beings. Śhrī Rāma was the ideal King for all kings, and <i>Rām Rājya</i>, His kingdom, was the ideal kingdom.<br />
He reached a point in the Primordial Heart Chakra (Ādi Anāhata Chakra) crossing the Void along the central path (Ādi Suṣhumṇā Nāḍī). His wife Sītā was an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. The <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i>, the epic about Lord Rāma's exploits written by Vālmīki, tells how Lord Rāma was made to forget that He was the Reincarnation of Ādi Viṣhṇu for some time, because it was desired that He should act absolutely like a human being, to make them feel absolutely free with him. He gave them a human leadership. Later on, when Sītā disappeared back into the Mother Earth, Lord Rāma remembered His divinity.<br />
At the time of Rāma's Incarnation Ādi Śhakti existed in three persons: Mahālakṣhmī, as Sītā, His wife; Mahāsaraswatī, as Satī Anasūyā who gave birth to Dattātreya, the Primordial Master; and Mahākālī as Mandodarī, the wife of the demon Rāvaṇa.<br />
......<br />
Whilst Dattātreya's Incarnation was created in the Void, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's was at a much higher point, higher than even the Primordial Heart Chakra on which Lord Rāma took Incarnation. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's seat in the body of the Virāṭa is the Ādi Viśhuddhi Chakra, and is placed at the base of the neck inside the spinal cord. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was in fact the Complete Incarnation of the Virāṭa whose form (<i>swarūpa</i>) He showed in a vision to His disciple Arjuna. His teachings to Arjuna are compiled in the <i>Śhrī Bhagavad Gītā</i>. As the Embodiment of the Witness State He killed many male and female evil geniuses (rākṣhasas and rākṣhasīs), as Lord Rāma had done. These entities have to be killed and destroyed again and again whenever they come in the way of human evolution. Ādi Śhakti's Incarnations are also mostly to kill demons. <br />
The Incarnations of Rādhā show how the ideas of human beings gradually changed. The life as Rādhā was definitely a peg above in social advancement in the dogmatic thinking of society, compared to the time of Sītā. She was not married to Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa in a formal human way (<i>laukika</i>). Their wedding was divine (<i>alaukika</i>), and was performed spiritually and socially in the presence of many people by Brahmadeva. Earlier, as Sītā, although formally married to Rāma in a wedding ceremony that was collectively sanctioned, She was still condemned by society. Kṛiṣhṇa's love and adoration of Rādhā brought Her glory without marriage, while Sītā was denied that public acceptance even though She was the legal wife of Rāma.<br />
Princess Sītā was married to King Rāma in a very traditional way. When He went into exile, Rāvaṇa the rākṣhasa, Satan disguised as an ascetic, appeared before Her and took Her away to the capital of his kingdom in Lanka. Rāma fought a war with Rāvaṇa to rescue His wife, who was secluded by Rāvaṇa in the core of his island kingdom. Rāma defeated His enemy and brought Sītā back to His kingdom, Ayodhyā. Although She was the purest of the pure, and the holiest of the holy, She was treated with suspicion by the citizens of Ayodhyā, Rāma's capital city. They would not accept Her as queen, blaming Her for having been abducted by force by Rāvaṇa. The suspicious citizens questioned Her chastity, and committed collective sin by rejecting Her. Although She was pregnant Rāma was forced to forsake Her. She lived with the Saint Vālmīki in the jungles of Bihar State where She gave birth to twin boys, Lava and Kuśha. They were absolutely human personalities but of very great spiritual heritage from previous births. Sītā taught them the divine way of life. They were later born again in Bihar as Gautama, known as Lord Buddha, and as Śhrī Mahāvīra, the leader of the great religion, Jainism. This all happened 500 years before the birth of Christ. Internally they reached a very great height through these births. They preached the doctrine of nonviolence (<i>ahiṃsā</i>) which was later developed into an extreme form of vegetarianism. They took birth in the warrior caste (<i>Kṣhatriya</i>) rather than as fanatical Brahmins in order to keep away from the extremes of vegetarian abstinences, and to stay more balanced. Still their disciples carried their teachings to the extreme of abstinence and vegetarianism. They confused inner asceticism (<i>saṃnyāsa</i>) with organized institutions of asceticism, and nonviolence with vegetarianism. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was later very much criticized by the so-called vegetarian followers of Buddha and Mahāvīra.<br />
......<br />
When one takes the name of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa one has to take the name of Rādhā first, so a seeker recites the mantra to the Virāṭa as 'Rādhā-Kṛiṣhṇa'. Similarly Sītā's name has to be taken before Rāma's for the mantra 'Sītā-Rāma'. Even the Virgin Mary (<i>Kanyā</i>) who was so quiet and potential at the time of Christ, was recognized later on by His disciples as the Power behind Him. She was worshiped for many years after Her death by early Christians. In modern times human beings who are satanic personalities are challenging the validity of the Primordial Mother's virginity and the Virgin Birth in particular. Mary has clearly shown the power of virginity that can raise a mother to such an exalted powerful position that she can conceive a child by desire alone. She had reached that high stage of evolution when by Her Divine Will, She could immaculately conceive. There are other such instances in Hindu purāṇik literature when Kuntī, by the wish of the Mantra, gave birth to the Pāṇḍavas and to Karṇa immaculately."</font><br />

<font color="red">"Tāntrikas controlled their spirits individually or in groups, and gave them mantras as code-names. One mantra for example, `{\it Auṃ Aim Hrīm Klīm Chāmuṇḍāya Vichai namaḥ}', is properly used to awaken Ādi Śhakti as Jagadambā or Chāmuṇḍā. This beautiful and powerful mantra should only be used by a realized Soul under the guidance of an evolved guru. But the same mantra was used by tāntrikas in such a way that each syllable was instrumental in summoning a group of dead spirits to be tamed and used by them. It is the same principle as giving your servant the name of a Deity, such as Rāma, which is quite a common usage in India. When you want your servant you call out the name of Rāma, and he is available at your beck and call. But God is not similarly available to every Tom, Dick or Harry. One has to be a realized Soul and have an authority to call God. Those who call Him without such authority will only succeed in summoning the services of dead spirits as slaves. Such dead beings will respond to a call for Rāma, if that was their name in earthly life. God however does not need the homage of such slaves."</font><br />

Rāja Janaka, another Incarnation of Dattātreya, was one such Rāja Yogi. In their inner life they were Yogis, but externally they led a royal existence, yet without attachment. They did not practice āsanas or Prāṇāyāmas, but they worshiped God through different styles of bowing. The Prophet Muhammad was the Incarnation of the same Primordial Master. He was married four times, but in His inner life He was completely detached. Śhrī Rāma's Incarnation also took place on the same channel and enlightened the path of Divine Kingship."</font><br />

His seventh Incarnation was as Śhrī Rāma who resides on the right side of the Heart chakra with His Power, Śhrī Sītā. Rāma incarnated as the representation of a personality who was the perfect male human being (<i>Maryādā Puruṣhottama</i>). Lord Viṣhṇu's eighth Incarnation was as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa who, with His Power Rādhā, resides on the Viśhuddhi chakra. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was the ultimate expression of the Primordial Being (Virāṭa) in human form, and taught us to regard the Creation as a play (<i>Līlā</i>) of the Divine Power."</font><br />

&emsp;2. On the right side of the Chakra is the seat of Lord Rāma, an Incarnation of Ādi Viṣhṇu, and His wife, Sītā, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti.<br />
&emsp;3. Pārvatī enters alone into the central part of the Chakra as Durgā or Jagadambā, Mother of the World. When Ādi Viṣhṇu incarnated as Lord Rāma, this central part was vacated by Durgā who, in Her role as wife, rejoined Lord Śhiva in the left chamber whilst Lord Rāma with Sītā occupied the central chamber.<br />

<b>The fourth center of Anāhat</b><br />
<br />
Is governed by Ādi Śhakti (the Goddess) as Durgā or Jagadambā whose sustenance is Universal Motherly Love. The left part of this Chakra governed by Śhiva and Pārvatī has the sustenance of existence, of innocence, simplicity and steadfastness. The right part of the Chakra is governed by Śhrī Rāma and His dedicated wife, Sītā, and has the sustenance of majesty, and His perfect political leadership. This couple symbolizes the steadfast love between husband and wife."</font><br />

<font color="red">"Those people who do not respect their parents and their elders always have a weak Mūlādhāra chakra when they come to Sahaja Yoga. They also have a very weak right Heart center (Anāhata chakra) where Śhrī Rāma resides with His wife, Sītā. If they are particularly unkind to their mothers, then the center and right Heart gets very weak. We must therefore understand just how important our parents are, and how the spiritual link is held in the inner being of personality. Our parents have their roots in the Primordial Parents, and marriage has its roots in their primordial and eternal loving relationship. Those who do not respect their marriage, or enjoy the glory of their chastity, also suffer from a very weak Heart center and Mūlādhāra chakra. In such shameless, sex-obsessed people the Kuṇḍalinī just does not rise."</font><br />

<font color="red">"Later on Śhrī Rāma who was one of the Incarnations on this Earth, showed in his own life that he respected people for their aptitude. For example when Śhrī Rāma was exiled and went to a forest, he met there a poor old woman called Śhabarī who was of tribal caste. She offered some berries to Śhrī Rāma with great affection and devotion. She said: ``Please eat them because they are not at all sour. I have already tasted them." The food or fruits tasted by somebody else are not to be eaten (uttiṣhṭa). If someone has bitten off even a part of a fruit, that fruit is no longer pure and cannot be offered to another person, certainly not to an Incarnation. But Śhrī Rāma was greatly moved by the love of the old lady. He accepted the berries with much joy and ate them. He praised their taste and gave some to his wife, Sītā. His brother Lakṣhmaṇ, felt rather jealous and asked for some berries for himself. There are many incidents where Śhrī Rām gets very friendly with people who were not of very high castes. Also his own Rāmāyaṇa, his life story, was written by a fisherman who was a dacoit. This fisherman was transformed into a Saint by another heavenly minstrel called Nārada. Of course an ordinary fisherman who was also a dacoit had such respect for Śhrī Rāma that he wrote this beautiful epic, the Rāmāyaṇa."</font><br />

<font color="red">"Śhrī Rāma has many special qualities. He was very powerful and a perfect archer. You might have heard about what He did in Sītā Swayaṃwara.<br />
The same Śhrī Rāma killed the Rāvaṇa when He came to it. Tulasīdās has described His bow very very beautifully. Śhrī Rāma was aiming at Rāvaṇa's head with His arrow. Out of ten head's of Rāvaṇa one will fall down, but again it will assume its place. Lakṣhmaṇa suggested Śhrī Rāma to shoot an arrow in the heart of Rāvaṇa, without which he will not die. "Hit him in the heart." Śhrī Rāma was a very humble person. Though He was very powerful yet hH said to Lakṣhmaṇa that, "Rāvaṇa has placed My Sītā in his heart, therefore, I cannot hit him in the heart. Again and again when I chop off his heads, his attention will be diverted from the heart. Only then shall I shoot him in the heart."<br />
What an example of the love of a husband for His Wife! Ocean of Power, how He was full of love! "</font><br />

<p>
<font color="red">"So, at that time, Śhrī Rāma's mother-in-law, I should say, who was the wife of Daśharatha, she said ... she used to s... she's r... like a big uh-uh-uh ... Sādhunī, and she said that: "From today, two marriages are not allowed, only one."<br />
So among Hindus there's only one marriage. They don't have two marriages. And regard it as a very sinful to have another woman, according to Indian culture. There are some people who do it, but is wrong. Is not Indian.<br />
The father-in-law passed the law, because he has, he suffered -- he had two wives. And one of them tried to send Śhrī Rām to the jungle. She was so cruel, because she wanted her son to become the king. And, as it was the mistake of the father, that he had promish... promised that he will give her a boon [twp boons], because she had saved him in war. And so now, she asked him to send Śhrī Rām to the vanavas [vanam], to the-uh jungle. By-ee-eeh second one [boon], she asked to give the kingdom to her son, who was Lakṣhmaṇa.<br />
But when Lakṣhmaṇa came he didn't want. He said, "I don't want to take Śhrī Rāma's ... uah-uah-uah seat because it is his right."<br />
So he went to Śhrī Rām, in the jungle, requested him: "To You must come! You must come to Ayodhyā, to the capital city, and You should be crowned." Śhrī Rām said, "I can't do it. I have to fulfill my father's wish."<br />
But, at that moment,, the father said that,  "In India nobody will have second marriage." Because of two wives the whole family suffered! So, him ... he said, "Only we can have one wife, and no two wives."<br />
Very surprising, that even till today, in India they believe that you should have only one wife.<br />
But uh-uh-uh what you find in another countries, that people may not have another wife, but they have affairs and they do not respect their wives. This is very sad! And the this makes the country suffering. Because if the women are treated like that, the women suffer, and if the mother suffers the children suffer.<br />
So he made a law: that, 'Nobody will marry twice.' "</font><br />

<font color="red">"Now, what can I say, you would be surprised, that the Shia sect that started after Muhammad Sāhab, His daughter was Fāṭimah, She was also Ādi Śhakti.<br />
And Her two children were, Hasan and Husayn, back then, when They saw even after the annihilation of the world, the human beings did not understand, then They were born as Buddha and Mahāvīra and They brought the non-violence as religion, and attempted that, 'Maybe with the establishment of non-violence people will achieve Self-realization.'

<font color="red">"After the birth of the daughter of Muhammad Sāhab, as I talked yesterday also, there was beginning of the caste Shia in Islam.<br />
Shia word has been derived from Siyā. The word which come from Siyā became Shia -- Siyā means Sītājī. If you go to UP [Uttar Pradesh, India] then nobody says Sītājī, they say Siyājī, 'Siyā var Rām[a]chandra ki jay.' Everyone takes the name Siyā. She was Sītājī, Ādi Śhakti Herself.<br />
And Her two sons, who were Hasan and Husayn, destroyed many evils. When They ultimately died after getting tried, then in the next birth they thought of establishment of nonviolence, violence led them nowhere.<br />
They were [re]born as Mahāvīr and Buddha to make a new experiment. Experiments do happen. "</font><br />

There are three stages to that also, but just now I have told this: the Sat-chit-ānand State.<br />
The God's Realization is the state in which Gautam Buddha and Mahāvīra only rose, and They are settled down here in our brains, both of Them are here, Christ is here.<br />
And these two were not Incarnations: They were born as human beings. They were born to Sītā, as Lav and Kuśh. Then they were born as Buddha and Mahāvīra. Then Ādi Śhakti was Their mother again. Then they were born to Fāṭimah Bi as Hasan and Husayn.<br />
They are both placed here, in your head.<br />
And They are the two milestones you have got, by which you can know what a human being can rise up to that now today They are like Incarnations. Incarnations are beyond, but maybe the gap can be bri... bridged."</font><br />

<font color="red">"Now in this Void we have two great entities as well which we know as Chandra [Moon] and Sūrya [Sun]. Moon and Sun are such chakras which reside on these nāḍīs here and here.<br />
On these chakras there are two very great personalities who have been appointed. They are complete embodiment of human beings. They are like humans, in fact are humans. Out of these one is Buddha and one is Mahāvīra.<br />
But if you listen to the whole history of Their lives, then these are two sons which Śhrī Sītā had as Lav and Kuśha who is completely in human form. And after They evolved to the level that They are here as Buddha and Mahāvīra. There also they thought They have reached an extreme of nonviolence because the supports of nonviolence came in and started protecting even mosquitoes and bugs.<br />
Then They again took birth and came at the time of Muhammad. Muhammad was an Incarnation of Śhrī Janaka and His daughter Fāṭimah Bi was also Incarnation of Śhrī Sītā.<br />
Then, as Their sons as Hasan and Husayn, They gave Their life in Karbalāʾ to prove that no kind of extreme is good.<br />
And this thing is Truth or not you can see on your vibrations. If [one thinks that] I am lying, then through your vibrations you would know that not even one single word is a lie here that I am telling you. "</font><br />

<font color="red">"Specially, these are the days of your marty[rdo]m. And I know about it, everything, what had happened to Hasan and Husayn. You all have done lot of penance for Them, and are still doing it. But now the time has come for all of you to know that Their sacrifice, Their kurbānī, has been completely fulfilled. After all, what did They want? They wanted whatever Their father, ʿAlī, wanted Them to do, also Their mother Fāṭimah. But we don't know, 'Who They were? What Incarnations They were? What was Their job?'<br />
......<br />
No need to feel guilty. You are not the ones who killed Hasan and Husayn, and still, if you feel that Hasan and Husayn should have lived, They can live through your lives. Only thing you have to know: how to become personality, make your personality of Their level. "</font><br />

<font color="red">"Later They were born in Arabia as Hasan and Husayn, the two sons of Fāṭimah, daughter of Muhammad Sāhib. They were murdered in a very violent war at Karbalāʾ. Their death signifies a great sacrifice in the name of religion. It is an indication how people who are extreme in nature take to fanaticism and, in their blindness, kill the very essence of religion that is born in flesh and blood as an Incarnation. This awakening gave a rude shock to the mass of religious human beings of the land, and there ensued a phenomenon of mass repentance. In this way people were made to realize that there can be no attachment to war for a realized Soul. Violence and nonviolence are attributes of mind but awareness is beyond these extremes. In defense of righteousness one has to go to war, but when one becomes the witness one only sees the play of war without taking any credit or discredit for it, or being disturbed by its aggression.<br />
After Fāṭimah, the Reincarnation of Sītā, died, sectarian war broke out among the Muslims. One side, the Shiya sect, was founded by Her; in Indian dialect Sītā is pronounced 'Shiya'. They are known today as Shiites. Shiya women are regarded as fair, innocent and beautiful because of their motherly expressions; in the same way the women of Janakapur, Sītā's birthplace in India, are similarly blessed by Mahālakṣhmī."</font><br />

<font color="red">"Princess Sītā was married to King Rāma in a very traditional way. When He went into exile, Rāvaṇa the rākṣhasa, Satan disguised as an ascetic, appeared before Her and took Her away to the capital of his kingdom in Lanka. Rāma fought a war with Rāvaṇa to rescue His wife, who was secluded by Rāvaṇa in the core of his island kingdom. Rāma defeated His enemy and brought Sītā back to His kingdom, Ayodhyā. Although She was the purest of the pure, and the holiest of the holy, She was treated with suspicion by the citizens of Ayodhyā, Rāma's capital city. They would not accept Her as queen, blaming Her for having been abducted by force by Rāvaṇa. The suspicious citizens questioned Her chastity, and committed collective sin by rejecting Her. Although She was pregnant Rāma was forced to forsake Her. She lived with the Saint Vālmīki in the jungles of Bihar State where She gave birth to twin boys, Lava and Kuśha. They were absolutely human personalities but of very great spiritual heritage from previous births. Sītā taught them the divine way of life. They were later born again in Bihar as Gautama, known as Lord Buddha, and as Śhrī Mahāvīra, the leader of the great religion, Jainism. This all happened 500 years before the birth of Christ. Internally they reached a very great height through these births. They preached the doctrine of nonviolence (<i>ahiṃsā</i>) which was later developed into an extreme form of vegetarianism. They took birth in the warrior caste (<i>Kṣhatriya</i>) rather than as fanatical Brahmins in order to keep away from the extremes of vegetarian abstinences, and to stay more balanced. Still their disciples carried their teachings to the extreme of abstinence and vegetarianism. They confused inner asceticism (<i>saṃnyāsa</i>) with organized institutions of asceticism, and nonviolence with vegetarianism. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was later very much criticized by the so-called vegetarian followers of Buddha and Mahāvīra. "</font><br />

<font color="red">"The Primordial Master was also born as Macchindranāth, and again as Zoroaster who was worshiped by the ancient Persians, and still revered by Parsis. Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism. In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates. He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā). Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918. Altogether there were ten major Avatāras of Dattātreya.<br />
Later They were born in Arabia as Hasan and Husayn, the two sons of Fāṭimah, daughter of Muhammad Sāhib. They were murdered in a very violent war at Karbalāʾ. Their death signifies a great sacrifice in the name of religion. It is an indication how people who are extreme in nature take to fanaticism and, in their blindness, kill the very essence of religion that is born in flesh and blood as an Incarnation. This awakening gave a rude shock to the mass of religious human beings of the land, and there ensued a phenomenon of mass repentance. In this way people were made to realize that there can be no attachment to war for a realized Soul. Violence and nonviolence are attributes of mind but awareness is beyond these extremes. In defense of righteousness one has to go to war, but when one becomes the witness one only sees the play of war without taking any credit or discredit for it, or being disturbed by its aggression.<br />
After Fāṭimah, the Reincarnation of Sītā, died, sectarian war broke out among the Muslims. One side, the Shiya sect, was founded by Her; in Indian dialect Sītā is pronounced 'Shiya'. They are known today as Shiites. Shiya women are regarded as fair, innocent and beautiful because of their motherly expressions; in the same way the women of Janakapur, Sītā's birthplace in India, are similarly blessed by Mahālakṣhmī."</font><br />

<font color="red">"Brahmadeva represents that aspect of God Almighty which manifests as the Creator of both the subtle side (esthetics), and of the gross side of material creation. Brahmadeva looks like an ascetic, a saintly personality, with a beard and mustache. He has four heads and all the hair on His heads is tied up in a top-knot. His body is thin with His most prominent feature being bulging and very large eyes. Brahmadeva rarely incarnates but He has incarnated once as Hazarat ʿAlī, husband of Fāṭimah and son-in-law of Muhammad Sāhib. Some ancient Sages tried to explain the meaning of His four heads as the expression of creation into four <i>Vedas</i>. The meaning of His heads is much wider and deeper, though. Brahmadeva is the symbol of the Creative Power of the Supreme, the Īśhwara, Brahma, God. This creative power is expressed through the plane of matter in this universe. All material things have three dimensions but there is a fourth dimension which only human beings can see and feel. This fourth dimension is the esthetic dimension created by balanced harmonies and the integration of different textures, forms and lines. Animals have no sense of beauty; only human beings can feel the esthetics of a composition of different colors, or the movement of lines and the melting of forms. The feelings of joy acquired through this esthetic sense create a <i>Rasa</i> (a secretion of the essence or juice of a feeling). This Rasa gives one a stimulative feeling that sets in motion waves of esthetic joy within the Inner Self. These joys are of different frequencies and vibrations. One does not need to dissect them but as I look at the different petals of this chakra, I shall try to explain the kinds of joys present in the realm of creativity expressed through divine enlightenment.

There's a fisherman in India ... [after 17 seconds (durig which She drinks whater):] who is, I mean is ... he's a graduate, though he's a fisherman. So, [laughing:] one day [in 1981], he was going on a boat to another island [village of Sakhar] to do Sahaja Yogaa. And when he came out of his hut he found huge, big clouds, black ones, hovering, and the Viṣhṇumāyā playing. Just he stood on the shore, and told Viṣhṇumāyā: "Please tell these clouds to behave themselves! I am going for the work of Mother, and dare not trouble me on the way!" Just stop it.<br />
The people who were with him told Me that this Hariśhchandra [Koli] was talking like that.<br />
They got into the boat, they did the program, came home. When he went into his boat [bed], uh rain started.<br />

Yeśhodā was Herself an Incarnation of Mahāsaraswatī. As Mahālakṣhmī She took two forms, Rādhā and Rukmiṇī. '<i>Rā</i>' means power or energy and '<i>dhā</i>' means sustenance, so the name 'Rādhā' means the one who sustains the power.

Now why has it been told to you that, 'You should not read the sixth chapter'? Because if you read that, these people who are leading you to the wrong path, people who are looting you, will not benefit. Hence this has been written.'

This is e ... is the basis of Sahaja Yoga.<br />
The basis of Sahaja Yoga is: that whatever these Great Saints, like Śhrī Gnyāneśhwara, Nāmadeva, Sant Tukārām, Rāmadās Swāmī, Ekanāth, and so many others, like Nāṇak Sāheb, Kabīr Das, and so many Muslims also, like Nizamuddin, Khwaja Nizamuddin, and Chisti, all these great people have been bien in this country, have been talking about the Divine, they have been saying, "There is the Divine surrounding us," but nobody could recognize them. Because they were not realized Souls.<br />
And this is the reason why Sahaja Yoga had to come to make people self-realized, and they can feel the divine all around you [them]."</font><br />

<font color="red">"But in the twelfth century, Gyānadeva, Gyāneśhwara, who was another Nāth Pānthi, His Guru was His own brother, He ... asked the permission, from His brother, that, "Please allow Me to say all these things openly. At least to say in Marathi language, because the common people don't know anything about this knowledge." So He allowed Him, and He wrote the sixth chapter of Gyāneśhwarī in which He described Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
But it was in the twelfth century.<br />
After that, many Saints described, talked about him [It].<br />
Where we went yesterday, to Sātārā, you know that's the place where Śhrī Rāmadāsa lived.<br />
He said that, "Kuṇḍalinī"" -- they asked, somebody asked:  "How much time does it take to raise the Kuṇḍalinī?" He said, "That Tatk-ṣhaṇa." Means, "That moment." "But the person who wants to take it should be deserving, and the one who wants to give should be capable."<br />
[As a Sahaja Yogi starts laughing:] It's a big condition. This is such a big if, capital If I tell you. [Laughs.]<br />
As a result, very, very few people got their Realization. And those who were born as realized Souls, found ... found it impossible to talk to people.<br />

Of course, He wrote another beautiful book, called Amṛutānubhava, where He has described what happens after Self-realization."</font><br />

Uh-uh but only thing was that in tradition: one guru used to give Realization to one disciple in his lifetime.<br />
This uh-huhh ... lasted for out tuh [the] twelfth century, when One of them published in His book, Gyāneśhwara, He published in His book, in the sixth chapter, about Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
It's a-uh-uh ... we can say, an a... exposition of the Gītā. But this ... uh, you see, this Gītā which was written, not by Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, Vyāsa, He wrote what you have to become. Just like what Christ said. Just uh-uh-uh just like what Qur'ān says.<br />
So, when everybody said the same thing, it was never told how to achieve it. That is how this knowledge was not given.<br />
Till the sixteenth century, [when] in India we had lots of great Saints. Like Guru Nāṇaka, Kabīra, Nāmadeva, so many of them. In Maharashtra like Rāmadāsa, Tukārām. They, also, said: that, 'Is the Kuṇḍalinī which gives you Realization' -- clearly.<br />
But people didn't give any attention to it.<br />

<font color="red">"The writings of these great enlightened souls are mostly in Sanskrit and were not available to the general public. Whenever translated they were not even mentioning Kuṇḍalinī awakening as the only way to achieve Self-realization. It was completely deleted when translated. It was in the twelfth century that a Great Incarnation of a Saint, Śhrī Gyāneśhwara (God of Knowledge) was born. He live[d] for only twenty-three years. They were three brothers and one sister. All of them were tortured by the dharma-mārtaṇḍas. Gyāneśhwara took the permission of His Guru (Master), who was His eldest brother, and wrote in the regional language a book called Gyāneśhwarī. In the sixth chapter He clearly wrote about Kuṇḍalinī but again the people in charge of religion (dharma-mārtaṇḍas) said that this chapter was not allowed to be read (niṣhiddha)."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="red">"Then came, in the Twelfth Century, a great Saint called Gyāneśhwara in Maharashtra. It was a tradition of his time that one Master of Nāth Pānthis could give Realization only to one disciple. This Master was not supposed even to talk about the fourth dimension to normal people. They were only told that they should remember God and should sing the praise of God. But He, the great poet and a very great Saint, Gyāneśhwara, felt that it was time that the subject of spiritual ascent should be made much more clear to people.<br />
In Gītā there is no description of the Kuṇḍalinī or of the awakening, though Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, at the very outset, has said that a person should achieve the state of Sthitapragñya, which means, the one who is balanced, through enlightenment by Divine Knowledge. All this was a description, but he did not talk about how it is brought about.<br />
It was Śhrī Gyāneśhwara who wrote a treatise on Gītā called as Gyāneśhwarī. In the sixth chapter he very sweetly described the nature of this fourth power, called the Kuṇḍalinī which rests in the triangular bone and the way it is awakened by some great Soul by which one gets his fourth state of awareness. He did not take permission from his guru to give Realization to others but he only asked that he should be permitted at least to write about it. Later on, this sixth chapter was not understood by the people who were in charge of religion (dharma-mārtaṇḍas). They said that this sixth chapter was not to be read (niṣhiddha) and thus this great chapter was completely neglected by the people and they just tried to follow the path of bhakti, which means devotion to God by chanting the names of God or singing the praise of God Almighty.<br />
There were three types of movements in our country. In the first one, people wanted to know about matter, the origin of matter, the origin of this world. In this quest they came to know how our right side is built up and what the elements that build our body are. The advancement on this knowledge led to science as a new field of study. Another aspect was constituted by people who were absolutely dedicated and were singing the praise of all Deities who were created by Mother Earth (Swayambhu). They sang praise of God and prayed to God Almighty in the way their gurus told them. There were also people in the middle path who were called the Nāth Pānthis, specially in Maharashtra. These were realized Souls who had received their Realization through the "one guru, one disciple" principle. Saint Gyāneśhwara was also from the Nāth Sampradāya, meaning the Nāth Cult. He was a great exponent of Kuṇḍalinī awakening in his book."</font><br />
