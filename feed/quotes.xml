"In the process of bettering his reflectors, he created the human being. And man alone in the entire known creation was gifted with a free moral will and a sense of discretion. Perhaps that the only way, after the ape stage, he could go further with the progress of evolution. It is thus that the human beings constitute the best reflectors of the Creator. <font color="red">Some of them as sages, like Lord Buddha, Jesus Christ, Lord Mahavir, mark the destination of human progress,</font> others as scientist discover the mighty forces of creation which are being constantly harnessed in the service of man. Similarly, some others gifted with extraordinary faculties of perception and understanding play the role of "Artists". They have not only an extra-ordinary "eye" but also an ability to communicate with others through the medium of art. They have an extremely sensitive heart and an equally eloquent medium by which they can touch the hearts of their fellowmen. This factor assumes a social importance and thus an artist plays a vital role, as member of a society."<br />

Buddha had dharma. His body was clean, His mind, the attention, did not find any joy in the worldly greed or desire.

"All the religions from ancient times have said that a man or a woman has to cleanse their mind through religious activity, with righteous thinking. The aim of every religion was to establish balance in every way to make way for the ascent of the seeker. <font color="red">The Second Birth, Walīhood, Selfhood, Buddha's State, Jaini State, Gnostic, or Ātma-sākṣhātkār, are all names for Self-realization.</font> It was all right in the olden days, where people wanted to be good and to ascend. They obeyed and tried to do whatever was asked for by the Saints, Prophets or Incarnations.<br />
......<br />
On the whole, if you see, Western culture denies Christ who sacrificed his life for the sins of the people. Those who call themselves Christians indulge in all kinds of activities which are anti-Christ. When Christ came into this world in the Realm of Divinity, one had to go through penance (tapasyā). <font color="red">Buddha and Mahāvīra had to do the same at that time.</font> Christians do not know what is penance and they cannot sacrifice even a pin for others. They are very good at lip service. Big conferences are held in the developing nations for monetary help, who pay for these conferences and the outcome is that nothing can be done for the poor countries while Westerners spend their superfluous money on all kinds of waste.<br />
......<br />
Now, a few words about Buddhism. <font color="red">Lord Buddha talked about compassion, compassion and compassion. He bore all the troubles of those days and at the end of his life he was in a very bad financial condition and ultimately he died in a very remote corner of India. Lord Buddha's life has been really ideal but people believe that you cannot attain spiritual ascent unless and until you suffer like Him and give up everything the way He had given it up.</font> The ascetic concept is that one has to give up the family, one has to give up money, property, all possessions, one has to give up the normal life that one leads and has to be an absolute celibate in order to move on the spiritual path. But there are Buddhists and Buddhists. Most of their different forms are lost in ritualism or mental meditation. The Japanese follow the Zen system without understanding anything about it. <font color="red">They have built a beautiful temple of Buddha in Bodhi Gayā where Buddha got his Nirvāṇa.</font> When Genghis Khān invaded Behar, the Buddhist monks did not resort to violence and died. Another style of Buddhism is that of the Japanese who had to learn a lesson through the extreme suffering of Hiroshima.<br />
The Dalai Lamas preach nonviolence, but they have been very money or gold-oriented people. In Beijing, one can see thousands of gold plates and gold beer mugs with Pali inscriptions in the secret vaults. It is said they were rescued from a river by the Chinese soldiers who went after Mister [Dalai] Lama and his followers who were running away to India and who dumped part of the gold they were carrying in the river. This was rescued and put in the museum. They wear saffron clothes to show that they are saṃnyāsīs but live like lords in Dharmaśhālā. I met such a Canadian saṃnyāsī in Canada and he told me that he had no other clothes but these. He said he lost all his property to Dalai Lama who begs all over the world. In Dharmaśhālā, there was a great protest against these very aggressive Dalai Lama's people, but many Governments have sympathy for this money-oriented (gold-oriented), spiritual head, so to pacify these ignorant Governments, who do not discriminate between truth and hypocrisy, the protesters had to ask for forgiveness.<br />
As it is, India has a large load of refugees and they cannot afford to have these gold-oriented saṃnyāsīs which have created a diplomatic rift between China and India. There are Buddhists in Nepal who believe in black magic. Many seekers go to Nepal and get lost. Buddhist Lamas are of many kinds. Some of them have monasteries where to raise the Kuṇḍalinī the seekers are beaten on the spinal cord till their backs are broken. In China they also worship Mother Mercy, Kuan Yin [Guānyīn], who was a Chinese Incarnation. <font color="red">Lord Buddha has given three mantras to chant: to surrender to Lord Buddha or a realized Soul; surrender to dharma (morality); surrender to collectivity.</font> They use a noisy wail to chant mantras. <font color="red">Like all other religious Incarnations he has talked of "Maitreya", is a future Buddha who will give liberation. "Maitreya" means that three Mothers together will incarnate to give Nirvāṇa.</font>"<br />

It is described that Śhrī Rādhājī prepared Her Son similarly as Śhrī Pārvatī did it but the main principle in this is Śhrī Gaṇeśha Principle and the Son prepared as Śhrī Gaṇeśha came in the world as Jesus Christ.<br />
<font color="red">Because Christ was prepared by Rādhājī so He got the name Christ in the name of Kṛiṣhṇa and Yeśhu in the name of Yaśhodā.</font> In this way, She manifested the Gaṇeśha Principle in the form of Śhrī Christ."<br />
<br />
<b>Version 2:</b><br />
Nowadays nobody reads Mārkaṇḍeya, but if you can get it, read the description of Śhrī Mahāviṣhṇu.<br />
He has mentioned that Rādhā had created Her own Son by Herself. Means just as Pārvatī created Her Son, She too had created [Hers].<br />
But Gaṇeśh Tattwa is the base for it. And based on Gaṇeśh Tattwa, the Son She had created, He came in this world as Christ.<br />
<font color="red">Now Christ. As Rādhā had created Him, He is called Christ in the name of Kṛiṣhṇa and as Yaśhodā is there, hence Yeśhu.</font><br />

"Now, if you study the etymology of the word Christ, you would know that the word has originated from a corrupted form of word Kṛiṣhṇa.<br />
As a matter of fact, the Father of Jesus Christ is Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. That is why He is called Christ.<br />
The manner in which His name Jesus originated is also very interesting. <font color="red">The mother of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, Śhrī Yaśhodā Mātā, was addressed as Yesu. Even today, we notice that in northern Indian somebody named Yeśhu is not addressed as such but as Jesu.

"Ādi Viṣhṇu's eighth form was as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa during the Dwāpara Yuga, and again Ādi Śhakti took three forms. Mahākālī lived for a very short time as Viṣhṇumāyā, the infant sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. <font color="red">She was actually born as the daughter of Yeśhodā, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's foster mother, and was killed by the demon Kaṃsa.</font> She later took birth as Draupadī, wife of the Pāṇḍavas. <font color="red">Yeśhodā was Herself an Incarnation of Mahāsaraswatī.</font> As Mahālakṣhmī She took two forms, Rādhā and Rukmiṇī. '<i>Rā</i>' means power or energy and '<i>dhā</i>' means sustenance, so the name 'Rādhā' means the one who sustains the power. As Rukmiṇī She became Queen to Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, the King in Dvārakā.<br />
......<br />
Rādhā in Mary's Incarnation wanted to give Her Son the name of Her Lord, Kṛiṣhṇa. Kṛiṣhṇa comes from '<i>kṛiṣhi</i>' + '<i>\it ṇa</i>'. '<i>Kṛiṣhi</i>' means farming, '<i>ṇa</i>' means the one who carries. So the name 'Christ' came from the 'kṛiṣhi' in Kṛiṣhṇa. <font color="red">The name Jesus was derived from Jasodā, a form of Yeśhodā, the foster mother of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. Rādhā also wanted to give Yeśhodā's name to Her Son because of Yeśhodā's devotion and worship of Her in Vṛindāvan and Gokul. The abbreviation of Yeśhodā was 'Jesu' or 'Yesu', so Rādhā/Mary named Her Son Jesus Christ.</font>"<br />

"Now about this power ... in our country many people knew about this for ages and they were called true Masters (Sadguru). These people had attained this knowledge through very hard penance.<br />
A power named as Kuṇḍalinī resides in our triangular bone. And we call it Kuṇḍalinī because it's [it] sits in the shape of three and a half coil. It is very surprising that even Greeks knew about this. Because the triangular bone where Kuṇḍalinī resides, they call it sacrum bone. It means there is this sacred bone within us. Not sure, if many of these things they adopted from us or they attained this knowledge themselves in sahaja way.<br />
<font color="DarkRed">In our country, experimentations to achieve Self-realization have been going on for ages. In Maharashtra [India] there have been people belonging to Nāth sect like Macchindranāth, Gorakhnāth, etc., these people were all into this.</font>"<br />

Śhrī Sītājī was His daughter, who was the embodiment of Śhakti Herself. <font color="DarkRed">Then He came as Macchindranāth, Zoroaster, and Muhammad Sāhab, who were a completely different type of human being.</font><br />
They trialed out lots of different things.<br />
Śhrī Datta, the Primordial Masters firstly in this world educated us about the symbolic forms within us. And then also said that, "You people got entangled in symbolism, in idol worshiping." Their meaning was to go beyond and recognize the Śhakti within these idols. That's why They talked about the idols."<br />

"The same Śhrī Dattā incarnated many a times on the Earth.<br />
As I told you yesterday, King Janaka was one of Them. King Janaka was the father of Jānakī [Śhrī Sītā]. He was none other than the Incarnation of Śhrī Dattātreya.<br />
<font color="DarkRed">Thereafter, Macchindranāth, most have you must have heard His name, was also His Incarnation.</font><br />
After that Zoroaster who came three times on the Earth, He was also His Incarnation.<br />
After that Muhammad Sāhab, who was His Incarnation.<br />
And when He was asked that, "Bhāī [Brother], there must have been others also before You," then He replied, "Yes, there [was] a Muhammad." Then again He was asked who was before Him. He replied, "There was one Muhammad."<br />
Muhammad means Praise, the One who is praised, the One who deserves to be praised and is the One who is Redeemer of the world.<br />
They were all Muhammads, They were all Dattātreyas, who came on Earth regularly.<br />
After that [was] Nāṇaka, Guru Nāṇaka. If you ever read His teachings, if you read His talks then you will be surprised that He has always talked in a Sahaja. He has said, "Sahaja Samādhi lago." He has said, "Kāhe re ban khojan jāe, Sarab nivāsī sadā alepā tohī saṃg[a] samāī, Puṣhpamadhya jo bāsa basata hai mukara māhī jaise chhāī, Taise hī harī base niraṃtara ghaṭa hī khojo bhāī." ["Why to go to forest to find Him, He is always there with you just like there is a fragrance in a flower and just as the reflection is there in a mirror, in the same way God is residing in you eternally, seek Him within."] He is just inside, achieve Him just inside. We are just singing poem, singing songs, we are just cramming His prescription.<br />
The talk of seeking this Absolute Principle, residing just inside the heart, has been made since ancient times by these Ādi Gurus, who are incarnated on this Earth again and again.<br />
......<br />
Now just look at Gaganagaḍ Mahārāj, it is true that he cured many people, but the problem is that his fingers moved inside like a telescope and those of feet also. The poor man lives on a tree or moves on a lion. Apart from this he cannot move anywhere. But when I reached to him, these people were with Me, he quickly recognized Me. There is no doubt about it. He has not yet seen Me in this lifetime. But from many years he knew about Me. He is elder to Me. He began to say, "Mother, I have been waiting for you for many years. Today I am so fortunate that you have come here." <font color="DarkRed">He is a Nāth Pānthi, so he is just like Macchindranāth and a very great person.</font>"<br />

"Now, we have had great Saints in our country, no doubt.<br />

And we had a Great Guru paramparā, Guru tradition in a ... that Nāth Pānthis.</font><br />
Even He, Gyāneśhwara, who was a realized Soul, no doubt, and His brother was really a very great Saint. Even He, when He writes about [the] Kuṇḍalinī awakening, He doesn't do the way you Sahaja Yogis [<font color="orange">unclear</font>].<br />

"In Africa, I was surprised: that they have talked about Kuṇḍalinī. They have! And I have seen some of the maps, old maps, of Africa, they have made the picture of Kuṇḍalinī also, all over.<br />
Even in a place like Bolivia, which is so far away, and the somebody went to Bolivia, from Italy, and he said, "Mother they know everything about Kuṇḍalinī!" I said, "Really?" "Yes, they know, but they don't know how to awaken It."<br />
And sprea... Sahaja Yoga has spread so much in Bolivia: the Minister from there came to see Me.<br />
And who told them? I said, "Who told them?" They said, "There were two Saints who came from India."<br />
Even in Ukraine, I was surprised, they said, "There were two Saints who came here from India, they told us about Kuṇḍalinī."<br />
Chinese people, they believe that there is a treasure of spirituality in India, but they don't know what it is, you see.<br />

They all represent the same element that is the water element. Being responsible or being born out of that, They are anxious to maintain water element as the one which is within us for sustaining ourselves. We su... we are sustained by water, so They help us to sustain ourselves. They are the sustainers: They tell us how to sustain us as a human being.<br />
And all of Them have tried to establish religion within us.</font><br />
A religion doesn't mean outside, but the religion as a man: means the capacity of a man, or you can say the quality of a man. What a human being should be like, what is the way to know if he is a human being or not, which is described in al... in the Ten Commandments."<br />

<font color="DarkRed">But, otherwise, She incar-nated as Fāṭimah. And She also uh ... incarnated as Nāṇaka's sister, as Nāṇakī.<br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Also, at the time of the Prophets, Mahālakṣhmī incarnates as a pure relationship with Them. Like Rāja Janaka's daughter was Jānakī, means Sītā, uh uh uh ... then She came on this Earth as the daughter of Muhammad Sāhab, and then She came on this Earth as Nāṇakī, the sister of Nāṇaka. So, She ... She resides as a pure relationship of these Gurus.<br />
Thus, the Mahālakṣhmī's greatest ... greatness is that: through Her Power only the Suṣhumṇā is covered by Kuṇḍalinī. She is the power of our evolution. And by Her Power only, we have risen to be human beings, and by Her Son's Power, we are going to become higher people.<br />
Thus the importance of Mahālakṣhmī is very great for all the Sahaja Yogis. Because She guides our Viṣhṇu Tattwa to its culmination, to its completion, which is the Principle of our Evolution. Thus She is a Giver of Dharma, She gives us the dharma, and She is the Giver of the Truth. She's the One who relates us to our brain. The whole brain's system is Mahālakṣhmī's system. So, it is She who exposes the whole of the knowledge as truth to us, on our central nervous system.<br />
But at the State of Virāṭa, when Śhrī Kṛiṣh... uh ... when Viṣhṇu becomes the Virāṭa, the Great Primordial Being, then She is called as Virāṭaṅganā, as His Power.<br />
So these are the Incarnations, of Mahālakṣhmī, about which I have told you."</font><br />

When Rāma came, Sītā was there. <font color="DarkRed">When Nāṇaka came, there had to be Nāṇakī.</font> When Janaka came, He had to have Jānakī, as His daughter. When Muhammad Sāhab came, He had to have His daughter, Fāṭimah. They could not do without the Power because they are just the kinetic energy.<br />
But when the Goddess came, She came alone. Because She has a Power to contain within Herself all the Powers."<br />

"Now this sisterly relationship existed in other Incarnations also. Like Muhammad Sāhab had a sisterly relationship ... uh-uh-uh ... with, actually, what we have to say, that: His sister as such was ʿAlī's wife, but She was born to Him as a daughter.<br />
<font color="DarkRed">So, They can be born as a daughter or as the sister. She was born as Nāṇaka's sister, Nāṇakī. She was born as the daughter of Muhammad Sāhab. So, it could be a sister or could be the daughter of an Incarnation.</font><br />
But daughter and sister are innocent, pure chastity.<br />
Now think of it: that those people who cannot understand the importance of chastity, how can they talk of any laws whatsoever? Because laws means maryādās. And it has the proper sense through the Power of Viṣhṇumāyā."<br />

"So when we read about the Devī, about Her Incarnations -- how She came on this Earth to save Her bhaktas, people who were trying to ascend, to cross this Bhavasāgara, how She worked hard, how She fought the devils, how She cough... She killed the demons, single-handed -- She took upon Herself the responsibility of making the people cross the Bhavasāgara.<br />
Guru gave you the strength to have dharma but She is the One who brought you out. Even those who were dhārmik could not do it because of the demonic pressure. She's the One who fought, single-handed, with Her Powers of destruction. In Her Love for you She fought. She brought you to this level.<br />
<font color="DarkRed">And then She took a milder form of Incarnation. Even during the time of all the Gurus, She took the Form of, as you know: Jānakī was the daughter of Janaka, then Fāṭimah was the daughter of Muhammad Sāhab, and Nāṇakī was the sister of Nāṇaka. In those Forms, these Powers s... sustained and nourished the Guru Tattwa. And later on, or sometimes simultaneously, They incarn-ated in milder forms to help human beings to rise.</font>"<br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Now let us see how many Incarnations we've had of Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī. Firstly, the Principle of Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī is very close with a Guru ... a relation of plenty of love and purity. Now if we see from the beginning with all the Ādi Gurus, She was born to them as a daughter or as a sister. Like the daughter of Janaka was Śhrī Sītā: She was the form of Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī, was the Principle of Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī. Sītā was Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī, and She was the daughter of Janaka. Then the sister of Śhrī Nāṇaka, Nāṇakī, She was Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī. Her relation was of sister. In the same way, the daughter of Muhammad Sāhib, Fāṭimah, She was Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī. After Her, Rādhā: Rādhā was the form of Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī. After Her, Mary: Mary was Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī, and Her relation was of purity. She was so pure that with Her purity She gave birth to Śhrī Christ. So She was a form of complete pure Virgin. And as She was a form of Virgin, because of Her purity She got a Son pure as Christ. So She was also Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī."</font><br />

<b>Another Sahaja Yogi:</b> Kuan Yin [Guānyīn]!<br />
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> <font color="DarkRed">Yes? You want to know about Her?<br />
That's an Incarnation of one of the ... yuh ... I mean in the Chinese mythology you find the Incarnation described of Kuan Yin [Guānyīn]. And actually, She is the One, who is the Vṛuddhā, is described as Vṛuddhā, She is the One, is the Aged One. Uh-uh-uh because uh Kuan Yin [Guānyīn] was born to a king. She was the daughter of a king. And She was the Virgin Form of the Goddess, and She would not marry. So Her father got very angry with Her, that She is not marrying. And he threatened Her, because he had arranged Her ... His marri... uh marriage with some great king, you see. And when the marriage took pla... mariage did not take place, father was so angry and annoyed and felt very humiliated. So, he-ee took Her to a hillside and got ... said ... threatened [Her] that, "I will throw You down." And actually She was thrown down from the hillside into a valley, and he thought, 'She must have been dead.'<br />
But there was a tiger, which held Her, and he carried Her along, and then he looked after Her. And when She grew very old, quite old, then She came out of Her hermitage. And She started prea... treating people. And many people got cured by Her.<br />
But She was quite old, then the father recognized Her. Because father was sick. She went and treated the father also. And She started curing people.<br />
And that's the Kuan Yin [Guānyīn].<br />
Uh-uh-uh if you go to Hong Kong, you can see Her statue: the face is very much like Mine, absolutely. But She is older looking, and Her uh shoulders are bent, quite bent.<br />
But She came much before Christ.<br />
And the uh-uh-uh ... the Buddhist felt that, 'People wouldn't give Her up, because She was so much regarded as the Mother of Mercy.' So, they included Her in the Buddha uh-uh-uh thing.</font><br />

<b>Version 1 :</b>
I mean to say that the Sopānamārga, which is Suṣhumṇā Path, the central path, is the Path of Lord Viṣhṇu. Through this path we attain the Śhiva Tattwa. So Śhiva Tattwa is the destination and the Path is made by Lord Viṣhṇu.<br />
This central path is the creation of Lord Viṣhṇu and the Ādi Śhakti. Lord Śhiva has no role in it: He sits comfortably in His Seat, without bothering for anybody. If someone wishes to come, may come.<br />
To attain Śhiv Tattwa we should go through this Viṣhṇu Path and correct all the centers that are created on it. When the centers are cleansed, the Viṣhṇu Path opens up and our ascent begins.<br />
<br />
<b>Version 2 :</b>
"Meaning that the Sopānamārga which has been created, which we call as Suṣhumṇā nāḍī, which is central path, is the Path of Lord Viṣhṇu. And through this Path we attain the Śhiva Tattwa. So Śhiva Tattwa is the destination to Śhiva, and the Path is made by Lord Viṣhṇu.<br />
To create this Path, Viṣhṇujī and Ādi Śhakti have taken efforts. Lord Shiva has no role in it: He sits comfortably in His Seat, not bothering about anyone who comes or doesn't come.<br />
So, to attain this Śhiv Tattwa, we should go through this Viṣhṇu Path."<br />

"I didn't tell you about the third kind of movement we had in our country, is of Nāth Pānthis.<br />
Jains have Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], and a deviation started from that: ah ... one guru was supposed to give knowledge to only one person. Like Janaka had only Nachiketa.<br />
Till the time of Gyāneśhwara, that's in the twelfth century.<br />
<font color="DarkRed">Gyāneśhwara was the disciple of His own brother, Nivṛuttināth. And They suffered a lot. And He asked Nivṛuttināth for one permission: that, "Let Me open the Truth to the public. Just I'll tell about it! I'll not do anything, I'll just tell about it."</font><br />
Because thirteen, fourteen thousand years back Mārkaṇḍeya has described about Kuṇḍalinī. Then came ... Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya has described about Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
But all in Sanskrit language. And Sanskrital knowledge was not available to the common public. And those who knew Sanskrit nalguage ... language didn't want to get into Self-knowledge.<br />

"One master would have one disciple, chosen for this.<br />
Thus, it continued till the twelfth century, when a very great poet called Gyāneśhwara, He started ...<br />
[Aside:] It's all right. [Laughs.] It's all right. [Drinks water.]<br />
He started, in a way, writing about Gītā.<br />
<font color="DarkRed">He requested His brother, who was His Guru, Nivṛittināth, that, "Please allow Me to write about Kuṇḍalinī because in the Gītā it is not mentioned. We must write about it!" So He allowed.</font><br />
And He wrote it in the sixth chapter of that Gyāneśhwarī.<br />
But people said ... the people who were in charge of the religion, that time, said: "This chapter is something to be condemned." Because they didn't know how to awaken the Kuṇḍalinī. "This has to be absolutely condemned, and nobody should read this one." Niṣhiddha is the word, is not so bad as it's condemned, but niṣhiddha: is not to be read.<br />
Thus, all this knowledge, of the inner be-ing, was kept in the darkness. And this knowledge of the inner being, not known to us, created the problem."<br />

"But in the center we had another great movement which is called as Nāth, Nāth Pānthis. They say it came from Śhiva, but whatever it is: it came from Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], and these people, and got diverted into many types.<br />
But those who remained in the middle, one of them was, we should say, was called Gahinināth. <font color="DarkRed">And his disciple was Nivṛuttināth, the elder brother of Gyānadeva.</font><br />
It is amazing, if you read anything about them, they know all about chakras, they know all about these, all three channels. Everything they new thousands of years back.<br />
Then somehow or other, they didn't tell people. They kept the knowledge to themselves.<br />
I can't say why they did it but they did.<br />
<font color="DarkRed">Ultimately, Gyānadeva took permission of His Guru, Nivṛittināth, and said that, "I, let Me tell you ... at least let Me tell others. You allow Me. Because people should know what works it out." So He wrote about Kuṇḍalinī.</font><br />
But if you read these ancient books, you will be amazed that the whole thing was described in those books: how you get your Realization, and how then we have those centers, which are to be enlightened, what problems come in.<br />
But the method they employed, [laughing:] for achieving it, was really hazardous again.<br />
I don't know why they had to do it but they did it.<br />
They were all unmarried people and very strict with themselves and they had to lead a life very secluded from the society.<br />
This was really a very difficult type of ascent they had.<br />
When I read about them I'm really is ... feel very, extremely sad, that all these great people who were seeking had to go through such horrible strenuous turmoil for days together, and then s-s-some of them got Realization."<br />

"To make the people cross the Void (Bhavasāgara) He has to make some arrangement. So the Great Power like Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, Maheśha was created and They were placed in the Area of Dharma.<br />
<font color="red">Dattātreya and Ādi Gurus incarnated in this world many a times. He incarnated as King Janaka who was like the father of Ādi Śhakti. After that He incarnated in Iran as Zoroaster, then as Macchindranāth, then as Muhammad Sāheb and Nāṇak Sāheb.</font><br />
No one fought with each other. See what type of darkness you are in?<br />
Fāṭimah, the daughter of Muhammad Sāheb was the same who became daughter of King Janaka.<br />
Whom are you fighting? Think over it.<br />
The Nāṇakī of Guru Nāṇaka was none else but Jānakī.<br />
Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth was also an Ādi Guru.<br />
<font color="red">They are the Masters of all.<br />
Also, They are My Gurus. These Ādi Gurus taught Me all this Knowledge. In different Incarnations They kept Me teaching.<br /> 
Ultimately I had to come and do His work. They could not do it and now They are placing Me as a Guru so that I take up the job of a Guru.<br />
There was an age when no one was willing to accept a woman as a Guru but in Kali Yuga only Mother could do His work: it is beyond the power of men.</font><br />
This work could not be done by force, only the love of a Mother could do it because already there is so much pressure, tension in this world. The day it is forced upon the human being they will break down. So, love is the only way out.<br />
So this Gurudom was given to Me. Everything is acceptable to Me.<br />
But I didn't know the qualities of a Guru.<br />
Gurus maintain distance but mother does not keep distance with the children. Children sit on her head.<br />
So, you people also could take liberty with Me and enjoy. Be with Me with full freedom, you will neither be afraid nor be embarrassed. There is no problem, you could come and talk to Me boldly about your problems. You could complain to Me as you do to your mother. I am freely available to you.<br />
Freedom was needed, religion was required to be discussed openly, there is no secret, no secret about it. Ultimately everything has to be explained very clearly. All the secrets are to be told about, everything could not be said everywhere."<br />

"But before reaching the Heart chakra, the gap I showed you, is all the Bhavasāgara. In the center is the seat of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, and on it Śhrī Brahmadeva creates the whole universe. He made this Bhavasāgara.<br />
After creating the Bhavasāgara, the question was, 'How to cross it over? The human being was created, but how to make him realize it? How to make human beings recognize it? In him, how to activate the Brahma Tattwa?' Meaning, 'How to get the Union of Śhiva and Śhakti within him? How would the connection be established?'<br />
For this, a special personality was created in this world. This was created by the combined essence of Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, and Maheśh, who we acknowledge as Śhrī Dattātreya. Śhrī Dattātreya is none other than Ādi Guru.<br />
He is My Guru. He has mentored Me all His past lives.<br />
If you hear about His birth and all His previous lives you would be amazed. We have forgotten such a great thing.<br />
Śhrī Dattātreya's Incarnations are numerous. Firstly He came as King Janaka. Śhrī Sītājī was His daughter, who was the embodiment of Śhakti Herself. <font color="red">Then He came as Macchindranāth, Zoroaster, and Muhammad Sāhab, who were a completely different type of human being.<br />
They trialed out lots of different things.</font><br /> 
Śhrī Datta, the Primordial Masters firstly in this world educated us about the symbolic forms within us. And then also said that, "You people got entangled in symbolism, in idol worshiping." Their meaning was to go beyond and recognize the Śhakti within these idols. That's why They talked about the idols.<br />
<font color="red">For example, there is a flower, and to describe the honey within the flower, They talked about the flower first, from which the people would taste the honey. But people got stuck to flower. So Then they took Incarnations and talked about the honey.<br />
In that, They talked about God in the abstract. They deliberately didn't talk about the reincarnation of life.</font><br />
Because as soon as you talk about past lives, people ask Me, "Mātājī, tell me about my past lives." The life that has passed, why do you want to know that? Whether you were a king or a pauper, what difference it will make?<br />
<font color="red">That's why They did not discuss past lives.</font><br />
Muhammad Sāhab was the same, Dattātreya's Incarnation, and the same Incarnation was King Janaka. The same Incarnation was Nāṇaka, whose sister Nāṇakī, was the same Ādi Śhakti. She was Sītājī."<br />

And His Child Tattwa also took Incarnations. First was Dattātreya, then came Rāja Janak. <font color="red">Like this, many Incarnations came, Rāja Janak, Nāṇak, Zarathustra, Muhammad Sāhab, Sāī Nāth of Śhirḍī.<br />
They are all one. Are They or not?</font> You can witness it after Self-realization. If you believe in one Guru, like Nāṇak, then you have no right not to accept Muhammad Sāhab. If you get Muhammad Sāhab and not Nāṇak, then you have no authority as well.<br />
You will be surprised, most of the cancer disease comes from the imbalance of Bhavasāgar, you follow one but not the other. Cancer also comes when we don't follow Them.<br />
Like He forbade two things, like not to smoke a cigarette and not to consume alcohol.<br />
Alcohol is entirely not allowed. Here, in Sahaja Yoga, if someone is habituated to drink alcohol, they will leave it. If they don't leave alcohol, it will [not] be in moderation because both of these things go against Guru Tattwa.<br />
If Guru Tattwa is not established within us, we cannot have our evolution. Guru Tattwa is essential. Guru Tattwa is one destiny for all religions. There is one flow from all the religions."<br />

"So the dharma that has been established in us by God Almighty because if we want to go to the Kingdom of God, then in our freedom we must desire to get to God. If someone tries to pressurize us and says, 'You must ask for God,' then it is of no use, it is not an evaluation. That is why to reach in this state, a person has to seek the God as per his own independent sweet will and not due to any pressure, or any disease or any hardships or any sorrow, but only because of the fact and realizing that, 'It is the only motive of our life to seek God.'<br />
<font color="red">That is why, when we desire for this Divine Gift, then the doors of God Almighty's Divine Blessings open for you, and around the center is a place of Ten Primordial Gurus. These are the Main Gurus which are the Incarnation[s] of Śhri Dattātreya. They are: Socrates, Moses, Muhammad Sāhab, Guru Nāṇak, Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth, and Zoroaster. They are all Incarnation[s] of one Incarnation.</font>"<br />

<font color="red"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> I have so far told you how the evolution was led by Viṣhṇu and His Incarnations on the Earth.<br />
Apart from this there was a unique Incarnation of the Primordial Master, Ādi Guru, in the Void or Bhavasāgara. He incarnated many a times to guide humanity to cross the Void.<br />
These Masters evolved new personalities endowed with the Principles of Disciples or Śhiṣhya Tattwa, who manifested as Great Disciples of this Ādi Guru. The disciples created by Ādi Guru were human beings but they achieved salvation with the help of their Gurus or their own efforts. They were not Divine Incarnations and are known as Avadhūts.<br />
<font color="red">They incarnated on this Earth as other personalities: Solomon, David, Guru Vasiṣhṭha, John the Baptist, second and third Zoroaster, Mārkaṇḍeya, Gaganagaḍ Mahārāj and the Nine Nāths.</font><br />
The Nav Nāths knew that Kuṇḍalinī awakening is the only way you can get your Self-realization. Their attention was enlightened, and they could just put it on matter or anything and it would work.<br />
For instance, Chāṅgadev would put his attention on heat and cook on it!<br />

"In the same way, Sahaja Yoga is the Ocean. You cannot name it. Do not try to find its identifity ... identity with other things.<br />
If you start doing that, then your mind will start becoming that small little cup.<br />
And moreover, if you are coming from some organized religions, it's very important to understand: that organized religions make your cup even stronger, it doesn't dissolve.<br />
If it is a disorganized religion, then it's a cup of earthenware, which can dissolve into this Ocean.<br />
But if it is a solid, nice porcelain [soft laughter], Meissen, then there is no possibility. Then you are adhering to all that conditioning, all that solidness, and then it's very difficult. <font color="red">All the time you have to bring in Christ, or you have to bring in Muhammad, or you have to bring in Zoroaster, or someone like that, who should be there to guide you.</font><br />
Now, your guidance is your Spirit, which is unlimited. So you don't have to bring any one of Them: They are all within you, They are part and parcel of you.<br />

In our country also, this knowledge was kept a secret for thousands of years. Though we can say people like Mārkaṇḍeya, whose dates could be fourteen thousand [years ago], or later on, up to Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, people did write about the Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
And at the time of Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, He very clearly talked about it. That was the tradition of evolution described in all these great Scriptures.<br />
Even in the Bible, you find the Tree of Fire. It says: "I will appear before you as tongues of flames." <br />
Even Muhammad Sāhab, who came much later, very clearly, very, very clearly, and elaborately, at length, talked about the Resurrection Day. He said: "At the Time of Resurrection, your hands will speak."<br />

"The material energy of sound becomes absolutely divine only when a realized Soul creates it by percussion or by vocal means. For example, chanting mantras or talking to Deities by non-realized souls creates barriers for their communication with these Deities, who become very angry with such unauthorized practices. Human beings must understand that there is a protocol for approaching the Divine; ignorance of it is no excuse. For example, if a non-realized soul continues to chant the name of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, he may get throat problems, and ultimately even throat cancer. Sounds that are used for invoking Deities in temples, or in the worship of God by realized Souls or Yogis, are the sounds which carry or reflect Divine Vibrations. Mantras are divine sounds, and the poetic language of the Scriptures is based on the complete divine expression of the sound element. The Lord's Prayer and <i>Namāz</i> are pure mantras. <font color="red">The Parsi <i>Avestha</i> Scriptures (of the followers of Zoroaster) and the Sanskrit <i>śhlokas</i> of the Hindus are all divine words which carry Divine Vibrations.</font> If these words are uttered by non-realized people, they have no meaning and give no connection to God. If they are uttered by unholy people, these can fall victims to the anger of the Deities. Such individuals may fall into the subconscious or supraconscious realms.

"In Japan we had another great Master whose name was Viditama. He was the disciple of Lord Buddha and he went to Japan and started the Zen system. Zen means meditation -- dhyāna -- and he wanted people to become "thoughtlessly aware". He found out many ways of making people "thoughtlessly aware" -- the tea ceremony and the temples that they have, are all meant to create thoughtless awareness. I was amazed that none of the Japanese knew what the purpose of these gardens were. There is one garden which has some moss on top of a hill in a very small area and it is very interesting. You have to see the flowers and other foliage there through a magnifying glass. All this should amaze a person and one should become thoughtlessly aware. That was the idea of Zen, but surprisingly, few understood Zen. <font color="red">Then there was a Prophet, Zoroaster, who was born five times in His country, Persia.</font> Ultimately Muhammad Sāhib had to come to say something very clearly about religion. <font color="red">But the people who followed Muhammad Sāhib, never realized the oneness of His preaching or that of Zoroaster, and they made all the Persians run away to all the other countries and so many of them came to India.</font><br />
Muhammad Sāhib has talked about Abraham, Moses, Christ in a series as They came one after the other. He has talked about the Mother of Christ especially with great respect. In the Bible She is not given so much respect because of Paul who edited the Bible. She is just called "the woman". But Prophet Muhammad says that anyone who talks against this Holy Lady will be punished, or something to that effect. So one can see that Muhammad Sāhib never talked of an exclusive religion called "Islam" (i.e., I surrender to God Almighty). But so many followers of Islam are fighting the followers of other religions and even amongst themselves."<br />
