<font color="red">"Princess Sītā was married to King Rāma in a very traditional way. When He went into exile, Rāvaṇa the rākṣhasa, Satan disguised as an ascetic, appeared before Her and took Her away to the capital of his kingdom in Lanka. Rāma fought a war with Rāvaṇa to rescue His wife, who was secluded by Rāvaṇa in the core of his island kingdom. Rāma defeated His enemy and brought Sītā back to His kingdom, Ayodhyā. Although She was the purest of the pure, and the holiest of the holy, She was treated with suspicion by the citizens of Ayodhyā, Rāma's capital city. They would not accept Her as queen, blaming Her for having been abducted by force by Rāvaṇa. The suspicious citizens questioned Her chastity, and committed collective sin by rejecting Her. Although She was pregnant Rāma was forced to forsake Her. She lived with the Saint Vālmīki in the jungles of Bihar State where She gave birth to twin boys, Lava and Kuśha. They were absolutely human personalities but of very great spiritual heritage from previous births. Sītā taught them the divine way of life. They were later born again in Bihar as Gautama, known as Lord Buddha, and as Śhrī Mahāvīra, the leader of the great religion, Jainism. This all happened 500 years before the birth of Christ. Internally they reached a very great height through these births. They preached the doctrine of nonviolence (<i>ahiṃsā</i>) which was later developed into an extreme form of vegetarianism. They took birth in the warrior caste (<i>Kṣhatriya</i>) rather than as fanatical Brahmins in order to keep away from the extremes of vegetarian abstinences, and to stay more balanced. Still their disciples carried their teachings to the extreme of abstinence and vegetarianism. They confused inner asceticism (<i>saṃnyāsa</i>) with organized institutions of asceticism, and nonviolence with vegetarianism. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was later very much criticized by the so-called vegetarian followers of Buddha and Mahāvīra. "</font><br />

Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism. In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates. He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya).

Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918. Altogether there were ten major Avatāras of Dattātreya.<br />
Later They were born in Arabia as Hasan and Husayn, the two sons of Fāṭimah, daughter of Muhammad Sāhib. They were murdered in a very violent war at Karbalāʾ. Their death signifies a great sacrifice in the name of religion. It is an indication how people who are extreme in nature take to fanaticism and, in their blindness, kill the very essence of religion that is born in flesh and blood as an Incarnation. This awakening gave a rude shock to the mass of religious human beings of the land, and there ensued a phenomenon of mass repentance. In this way people were made to realize that there can be no attachment to war for a realized Soul. Violence and nonviolence are attributes of mind but awareness is beyond these extremes. In defense of righteousness one has to go to war, but when one becomes the witness one only sees the play of war without taking any credit or discredit for it, or being disturbed by its aggression.<br />
After Fāṭimah, the Reincarnation of Sītā, died, sectarian war broke out among the Muslims. One side, the Shiya sect, was founded by Her; in Indian dialect Sītā is pronounced 'Shiya'. They are known today as Shiites. Shiya women are regarded as fair, innocent and beautiful because of their motherly expressions; in the same way the women of Janakapur, Sītā's birthplace in India, are similarly blessed by Mahālakṣhmī."</font><br />

<font color="red">"Brahmadeva represents that aspect of God Almighty which manifests as the Creator of both the subtle side (esthetics), and of the gross side of material creation. Brahmadeva looks like an ascetic, a saintly personality, with a beard and mustache. He has four heads and all the hair on His heads is tied up in a top-knot. His body is thin with His most prominent feature being bulging and very large eyes. Brahmadeva rarely incarnates but He has incarnated once as Hazarat ʿAlī, husband of Fāṭimah and son-in-law of Muhammad Sāhib. Some ancient Sages tried to explain the meaning of His four heads as the expression of creation into four <i>Vedas</i>. The meaning of His heads is much wider and deeper, though. Brahmadeva is the symbol of the Creative Power of the Supreme, the Īśhwara, Brahma, God. This creative power is expressed through the plane of matter in this universe. All material things have three dimensions but there is a fourth dimension which only human beings can see and feel. This fourth dimension is the esthetic dimension created by balanced harmonies and the integration of different textures, forms and lines. Animals have no sense of beauty; only human beings can feel the esthetics of a composition of different colors, or the movement of lines and the melting of forms. The feelings of joy acquired through this esthetic sense create a <i>Rasa</i> (a secretion of the essence or juice of a feeling). This Rasa gives one a stimulative feeling that sets in motion waves of esthetic joy within the Inner Self. These joys are of different frequencies and vibrations. One does not need to dissect them but as I look at the different petals of this chakra, I shall try to explain the kinds of joys present in the realm of creativity expressed through divine enlightenment.

There's a fisherman in India ... [after 17 seconds (durig which She drinks whater):] who is, I mean is ... he's a graduate, though he's a fisherman. So, [laughing:] one day [in 1981], he was going on a boat to another island [village of Sakhar] to do Sahaja Yogaa. And when he came out of his hut he found huge, big clouds, black ones, hovering, and the Viṣhṇumāyā playing. Just he stood on the shore, and told Viṣhṇumāyā: "Please tell these clouds to behave themselves! I am going for the work of Mother, and dare not trouble me on the way!" Just stop it.<br />
The people who were with him told Me that this Hariśhchandra [Koli] was talking like that.<br />
They got into the boat, they did the program, came home. When he went into his boat [bed], uh rain started.<br />
So you control all five elements by your enlightened faith. For which, you don't even have to say anything: the powers are so great that they act. "</font><br />

She was actually born as the daughter of Yeśhodā, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's foster mother, and was killed by the demon Kaṃsa. She later took birth as Draupadī, wife of the Pāṇḍavas. Yeśhodā was Herself an Incarnation of Mahāsaraswatī. As Mahālakṣhmī She took two forms, Rādhā and Rukmiṇī. '<i>Rā</i>' means power or energy and '<i>dhā</i>' means sustenance, so the name 'Rādhā' means the one who sustains the power.

<font color="red">"The writings of these great enlightened souls are mostly in Sanskrit and were not available to the general public. Whenever translated they were not even mentioning Kuṇḍalinī awakening as the only way to achieve Self-realization. It was completely deleted when translated. It was in the twelfth century that a Great Incarnation of a Saint, Śhrī Gyāneśhwara (God of Knowledge) was born. He live[d] for only twenty-three years. They were three brothers and one sister. All of them were tortured by the dharma-mārtaṇḍas. Gyāneśhwara took the permission of His Guru (Master), who was His eldest brother, and wrote in the regional language a book called Gyāneśhwarī. In the sixth chapter He clearly wrote about Kuṇḍalinī but again the people in charge of religion (dharma-mārtaṇḍas) said that this chapter was not allowed to be read (niṣhiddha)."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="red">"Then came, in the Twelfth Century, a great Saint called Gyāneśhwara in Maharashtra. It was a tradition of his time that one Master of Nāth Pānthis could give Realization only to one disciple. This Master was not supposed even to talk about the fourth dimension to normal people. They were only told that they should remember God and should sing the praise of God. But He, the great poet and a very great Saint, Gyāneśhwara, felt that it was time that the subject of spiritual ascent should be made much more clear to people.<br />
In Gītā there is no description of the Kuṇḍalinī or of the awakening, though Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, at the very outset, has said that a person should achieve the state of Sthitapragñya, which means, the one who is balanced, through enlightenment by Divine Knowledge. All this was a description, but he did not talk about how it is brought about.<br />
It was Śhrī Gyāneśhwara who wrote a treatise on Gītā called as Gyāneśhwarī. In the sixth chapter he very sweetly described the nature of this fourth power, called the Kuṇḍalinī which rests in the triangular bone and the way it is awakened by some great Soul by which one gets his fourth state of awareness. He did not take permission from his guru to give Realization to others but he only asked that he should be permitted at least to write about it. Later on, this sixth chapter was not understood by the people who were in charge of religion (dharma-mārtaṇḍas). They said that this sixth chapter was not to be read (niṣhiddha) and thus this great chapter was completely neglected by the people and they just tried to follow the path of bhakti, which means devotion to God by chanting the names of God or singing the praise of God Almighty.<br />
There were three types of movements in our country. In the first one, people wanted to know about matter, the origin of matter, the origin of this world. In this quest they came to know how our right side is built up and what the elements that build our body are. The advancement on this knowledge led to science as a new field of study. Another aspect was constituted by people who were absolutely dedicated and were singing the praise of all Deities who were created by Mother Earth (Swayambhu). They sang praise of God and prayed to God Almighty in the way their gurus told them. There were also people in the middle path who were called the Nāth Pānthis, specially in Maharashtra. These were realized Souls who had received their Realization through the ``one guru, one disciple" principle. Saint Gyāneśhwara was also from the Nāth Sampradāya, meaning the Nāth Cult. He was a great exponent of Kuṇḍalinī awakening in his book."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="red">"Śhrī Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya lived in sixth century A.D. He wrote many texts: Saundaryalaharī, Upadeśhasāhasri, Vivekachūḍāmaṇi, Ātmabodh, etc. In most of these texts, there are various references to Kuṇḍalinī awakening, as some of the following stanzas [10 and 9 from Saundaryalaharī] will illustrate."</font><br />
[Having in-filled in the pathway of the nāḍīs with the streaming shower of Nectar flowing from Thy pair of Feet (Lotus Feet), having resumed Thine own position from out of resplendent lunar regions, and Thyself assuming the form of a serpent of three and a half coils, sleepest Thou in the hollow of the Kulakuṇḍa.] [Kulakuṇḍa=the hollow of the Mūlādhāra -- sacrum bone.]<br />
[Thou art diverting (residing) in secrecy with Thy Lord (the Spirit) in the thousand-petalled Lotus, having pierced through the Earth situated in Mūlādhāra, the Water in the Maṇipūra, the Fire abiding in the Swādhiṣhṭhāna, the Air in the Heart (Anāhata), the Ether above (the Viśhuddhi) and Manas between the eyebrows (Āgñyā) and thus broken the entire Kula path.]<br />
<font color="red">"Śhrī Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya propounded that it is the Kuṇḍalinī who has to be awakened and unless and until you get your Realization you are nowhere near religion. Śhrī Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya also had given a very befitting answer to the so-called proponents of Haṭha Yoga, Gyān Yoga, Karma Yoga or Rāj Yoga. "Neither by Yoga, nor philosophy, nor by work, nor by learning but by the Realization of one's identity with the Brahman is liberation possible and by no other means."</font><br />

As Last Judgment time has come. It's your wish to attain the Truth or leave it.<br />
Human beings can achieve a lot from this.<br />
First achievement is that we can feel this All-pervading Power (Paramachaitanya) on your fingers and very soothing, settle cool [not very cold] breeze flows from your fontanel bone area.<br />
Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya called it, "Salīlam, salīlam ..." The vibrations that flow through your hands, he called it, "Spand." "</font><br />

<p>
<font color="red">"I go to meet the big and great gurus and talk to them that, 'What are you doing?' By doing all this you cannot get God. You must understand by doing all this you will not get God.<br />
What I am saying? Read Vasiṣhṭha, or Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, because it is a historical thing. They have said the same thing that you get to God you cannot do anything. But there is a slight difference between them and Me that they had said that are very few who have the authority to get to God. Some should remain in bhakti and others should do some yogas so that they can keep their discipline. But they also said that a disciplined mind or a mind that is running after indulgences, both minds are useless for ascent. One has to have a mind like a small child which is without sin, and is innocent. Such a one has the right to attain God. This is what they have clearly said. But who reads them?<br />
The question is that we read a lot and we read about those who know nothing about dharma. And even if they know it is just a little bit.<br />
The ones who think they are very great Hindus they must first read Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya. Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya had established the Hindu Dharma. Then why not read Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya?<br />
You read all the books of the world, but why don't you read Him and know Him?<br />
The difference between what He said and I say is that He said that in crores there are just one or two and I say in crores, there are lākhs.<br />
......<br />
There is no need to fight with people who talk useless things. Those who want to come should come and those who don't want to come should not come. There is no time left to argue and have discussions with them, because such people will go on discussing and arguing.<br />
As Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya has said that low-level people should keep their minds disciplined and somehow live properly and protect themselves from becoming thieves, etc. They should live like good citizens."</font><br />

But those who claim themselves to be biggest Hindus do not know Śhaṅkarāchārya.<br />
Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya has talked of nothing but Sahaja Yoga.<br />
He had just said, "Na Sāṅkhyen na Yogen"</font> [an inversion of the first part of line 1 of Vivekachūḍāmaṇi 56], <font color="red">"God is not achieved either by Sāṅkhya or Yoga," He is achieved in a sahaja way, spontaneously. The growth is spontaneous and He [God] had not made any caste.<br />
He [Śhī Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya] had said that, 'There were three kind of people in the world, the one who of lower level, those who do not have much intelligence. Those who have not yet developed fully as a human being.'<br />
......<br />
Now the only difference between him [Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya] and Me is that He used to say there that there is one in millions and I say that there are thousands in millions. This is the only difference between both of us.<br />
It may be possible that there used to be such people in sixth century but as of today I see there are thousands of them who are getting this thing."</font><br />

<font color="red">"You cannot seek God through any other Yoga. 

I bow to Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, who is the eldest Son of our country: He is very big man of our country. Although, Hindu religion is very much degraded and we just could not understood what Hindu religion is all about. Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya has clearly said, "Na Sāṅkhyen na Yogen" [an inversion of the first part of line 1 of Vivekachūḍāmaṇi 56], "God can't be achieved by anything." And He also has said that there are three types of people.<br />
First types of persons are those who seek God in devotion, they do not have intelligence. They do not understand they have not yet established a connection, then how they can talk to God? They cram like mad, shouts like mad and die after getting mad. But I would have no objection if it would have stopped just here, sometimes in this madness a man gets connected to Paralok [Collective Subconscious] and bhūt vidyā, etc. enters in him. It may happen.<br />
Second type of person is a person with very sharp intelligence, very intelligent, but he has very unstable mind. He runs here and there, run this way and that way. So such a person thinks of yoga practice, so that one can control mind. This is also very wrong attitude. You cannot reach there by controlling mind. So that person controls the mind, thinks that by controlling he will reach [there]. Such disciplined mind, such mind cannot take you to God, the car in which brakes are applied cannot take you there.<br />
But from this it should not be understood that the one who is indulgent or is very voluptuous, he can reach God. He can never reach to God. But the person who leaves all these things to think that, 'I have to seek that,' and he disciplines himself too much in the name of religion, he also does not reach.<br />
Actually, we have to become, we have to just become."</font><br />

<font color="red">"The roots of Tantrism are as ancient as the awareness of religion, but it came into full force during the years 900 -- 1400 A.D. Following the Advent of Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, the great Hindu reforming Saint, or even earlier under the Emperor Aśhoka, anti-religious forces built up in India as a reaction to extreme asceticism. Jainism had reached its spiritual height through the achievements of very few adherents, and was embraced by many government ministers. They created a sense of artificial and outwardly austere asceticism. The kings, feeling oppressed by this extremely unnatural lifestyle, gave royal support to Tantrism. Later on, many other Court officials also played a great role in creating the necessary atmosphere for Tantrism's rapid spread. In retrospect, by the 6th century, absurd monastic ways of life in the three official religions, Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, made people colorless and stereotypical. Ironically, all the three religions believed in the middle Path of Righteousness. "</font><br />

I have to say that it is truly lamentable the way earnest seekers have been exploited by these horrible so-called gurus from India. For seekers are a special category of people and, as such, they are very precious. William Blake describes them as "men of God". They are the ones who have been seeking in many lifetimes to find the Divine and have often become lost in the web of words of false ideas ("śhabda jālam" in Sanskrit, as described by Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya)."</font><br />

He has written about this fourth dimension and has described it as the blessing of the Primordial Mother. The second person who was very well equipped with this knowledge, was Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya who has written many books. The first book he wrote was Vivekachūḍāmaṇi, in which he describes this fourth dimension and explains why we should try to attain this fourth dimension. An intellectual, one Mister Sharma, challenged him and told him that he could not do anything as an ascetic and win over my intellect. Thus he felt that for the common people all this discussion might just seem to be mental acrobatics. So he decided to write books just praising the Primordial Mother, especially in Saundaryalaharī, where he described all the Divine Vibrations as the vibrations of the loving beauty of the Primordial Mother. At that time all this was written in the Sanskrit language but the common people did not understand this language, except for a very few learned people, who also did not want to go into the details of this exposition."</font><br />

By his incarnation the human imagination was to become aware of the Great Primordial Being and therefore poets and philosophers entered the intuitive realm of metaphysical perceptions. He employed the method of Divine Diplomacy to explain the true nature of reality to people.

In the life of Jesus Christ (incarnation of Maha Vishnu) the highest expression of the essence of spiritual innocence came on this earth. Human beings witnessed the sacrifice of the dearest and only son of the Father (Virata) for the sake of humanity. This allowed a deeper human perception for God's great love for humanity. The crucifixion of Christ happened at a time when people knew about Go almighty the Father but did not know how to crucify their human self to make the spiritual self express itself; tis is the meaning of the Resurrection of Christ by which man could be the physical witness of the immortality of the spirit which does not suffer or perish. The human awareness first time registered the truth of immortality of spirit which Krishna preached in his lifetime."</font><br />

&emsp;<i>viii. Playful Witness</i> The Virāṭa Kṛiṣhṇa Avatāra<br />
......<br />
During the Dwāpara Yuga at the time of Lord Kṛiṣhṇa, Ādi Śhakti again incarnated as three separate human personalities, expressing Her three aspects:<br /> 
<br />
&emsp;1. Rādhā (Mahālakṣhmī) as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's first and eternal love<br />
&emsp;2. Rukmiṇī (Mahāsaraswatī) as Kṛiṣhṇa's Queen<br />
&emsp;3. Viṣhṇumāyā (Mahākālī) as sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. She lived but for a short time. She later took birth as Draupadī, wife of the Pāṇḍavas.<br />
......<br />
The ellipse now opens at its base [see {\it Figure 2}]. Viṣhṇu leaves His imprint on the parallel line as a point indicating a seat for His future highest-evolved human form as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa; Gaṇeśha, likewise, leaves the imprint of a point to demark the position reserved for His highest-evolved human form as Jesus Christ. A gap is therefore created between the Divine Form of Viṣhṇu and His human form as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, into which He has later to flower, manifesting the complete form of the Virāṭa. In precisely the same way there is a gap between the Divine Form of Śhrī Gaṇeśha and His fully evolved human form as Jesus Christ. Christ is also Mahāviṣhṇu, Son of the Virāṭa. They face each other on the two sides of the parabola.<br />
This is how Ādi Śhakti arranges the Deities in the Primordial Brain. The whole process is not a simultaneous happening, but grows gradually over countless ages as the Primordial Brain of the Virāṭa grows as a living organism. These seats are fully anointed by their respective Incarnations in the Vaikuṇṭha Stage of existence. That means that the creation of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa and Jesus Christ was conceived millions of years before they actually incarnated in human form."</font><br />
<font size="+0"><b>The Book of Ādi Śhakti, Chapter 1: Creation, the Eternal Play}</b></font>
</p>

<div class="para-divider"></div>

<p>
<font color="red">"Ādi Viṣhṇu's eighth form was as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa during the Dwāpara Yuga, and again Ādi Śhakti took three forms. Mahākālī lived for a very short time as Viṣhṇumāyā, the infant sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. She was actually born as the daughter of Yeśhodā, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's foster mother, and was killed by the demon Kaṃsa. She later took birth as Draupadī, wife of the Pāṇḍavas. Yeśhodā was Herself an Incarnation of Mahāsaraswatī. As Mahālakṣhmī She took two forms, Rādhā and Rukmiṇī. '<i>Rā</i>' means power or energy and '<i>dhā</i>' means sustenance, so the name 'Rādhā' means the one who sustains the power. As Rukmiṇī She became Queen to Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, the King in Dvārakā.<br />
Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, who was the greatest expression of God the Father, incarnated to open another horizon in human understanding of the Power of Divine Love to watch the play of God's Power as a witness. By His Incarnation, human imagination was to become aware of the witnessing powers of God Almighty. The Great Primordial Being (Virāṭa) was actually expressed through Him, and His Advent enabled poets and philosophers to enter the intuitive realm of metaphysical perceptions. He employed the method, as king and diplomat, of Divine Diplomacy to explain the true nature of reality to people. The beauty of Divine Diplomacy is to achieve the spiritual betterment of people; its essence is to guide ignorant and foolish people towards the Path of Righteousness and Religion by diplomatic ways, by clever handling or by illusion. In short, such people must be brought to the shores of Divine Love 'by hook or by crook'. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's life was spent with the masses, and thus His Incarnation gave rise to a mass spiritual movement. He appeared before Arjuna as the Virāṭa, and for the first time human eyes got a glimpse of the Primordial Being Himself.<br />
In ancient times it was said that one should speak the truth (<i>satyam</i>) which is pleasing (<i>priyam</i>). Often, though, to tell the truth can hurt another's feelings. This contradictory statement was later challenged by many intellectuals. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa explained that if the object of the betterment of Spirit (<i>hita</i>) is inserted between telling the truth and pleasing or endearing, then it is possible to unobtrusively tell the truth. He meant that if truth is told for the betterment or upliftment of Spirit, ultimately it becomes an endearment and pleases the Spirit.<br />
In their early days, Rādhā and Kṛiṣhṇa played a game of <i>Rāsa</i> (<i>rā</i> + <i>sa</i> -- meaning 'with energy'). Rāsa is the play which manifests identification with the Power of God. It was the play of Sahaja Yoga, of the Divine Circuit of Vibrations. All Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's playmates were innocent, simple cow herders (<i>gopīs</i> and <i>gopas</i>). They did not know that he was trying to manifest the working of Sahaja Yoga (spontaneous growth of the inner self) through the play (<i>Līlā</i>) of Rāsa. It was a very simple game similar to 'Ring-A-Ring-A-Roses'.<br />
When Rādhā filled pitchers of water from the Yamunā River She automatically vibrated that water with Praṇava, as She was Ādi Śhakti and was carrying the water on Her head. When Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa broke the hers the vibrated water was meant to fall on the soil of Vṛindāvan where Kṛiṣhṇa and Rādhā lived, vibrating it. Similarly when Rādhā placed Her Feet in the Yamunā River, the waters of the river became vibrated. Se when the gopīs and their husbands, the simple folk of Vṛindāvan, carried water from the river in earthenware pitchers, Kṛiṣhṇa broke the pitchers so that the vibrated water would fall from their heads onto their spinal cord. Their Kuṇḍalinī would thus be awakened and raised, and they would get their Self-realization through the spontaneous awakening of Sahaja Yoga. It was sportive and playful baptism, but all these tricks or designs of Kṛiṣhṇa do not completely and immediately work out the whole manifestation of Sahaja Yoga. He could only sow the seed of Sahaja Yoga, His name meaning 'the One who sows' (<i>Kṛiṣhi</i>). The gopīs and gopas did get Kuṇḍalinī awakening which was a great achievement. The awakened state of their Kuṇḍalinī made the finite nature of human beings enlightened and enlarged their consciousness, but they still could not pierce into the infinite. That was left to be done after Kṛiṣhṇa's time, and thus awakened, their Kuṇḍalinīs needed many years of effort or many lives' experience to become receptive to Sahaja Yoga.<br />
Whilst Dattātreya's Incarnation was created in the Void, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's was at a much higher point, higher than even the Primordial Heart Chakra on which Lord Rāma took Incarnation. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's seat in the body of the Virāṭa is the Ādi Viśhuddhi Chakra, and is placed at the base of the neck inside the spinal cord. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was in fact the Complete Incarnation of the Virāṭa whose form (<i>swarūpa</i>) He showed in a vision to His disciple Arjuna. His teachings to Arjuna are compiled in the <i>Śhrī Bhagavad Gītā</i>. As the Embodiment of the Witness State He killed many male and female evil geniuses (rākṣhasas and rākṣhasīs), as Lord Rāma had done. These entities have to be killed and destroyed again and again whenever they come in the way of human evolution. Ādi Śhakti's Incarnations are also mostly to kill demons.<br />
The Incarnations of Rādhā show how the ideas of human beings gradually changed. The life as Rādhā was definitely a peg above in social advancement in the dogmatic thinking of society, compared to the time of Sītā. She was not married to Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa in a formal human way (<i>laukika</i>). Their wedding was divine (<i>alaukika</i>), and was performed spiritually and socially in the presence of many people by Brahmadeva. Earlier, as Sītā, although formally married to Rāma in a wedding ceremony that was collectively sanctioned, She was still condemned by society. Kṛiṣhṇa's love and adoration of Rādhā brought Her glory without marriage, while Sītā was denied that public acceptance even though She was the legal wife of Rāma.<br />
......<br />
Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was later very much criticized by the so-called vegetarian followers of Buddha and Mahāvīra.<br />
......<br />
The greatness of this Incarnation cannot be adequately described in words but in the <i>Devī Bhāgavatam</i> there is a passage about Christ. It tells how He was born in Heaven to Rādhā as Mahāviṣhṇu, the only Son of the Virāṭa. He is none other than Śhrī Gaṇeśha, the symbol of eternal childhood. His body was constructed from the body of Śhrī Kārttikeya who was Brahma Himself, the only brother of Śhrī Gaṇeśha, and was conceived by one-sixteenth part of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, the Virāṭa, who was His Father. As Mahāviṣhṇu He is the sustainer (<i>āśhraya</i>) of the whole world. A father always wants his son to be greater than himself, so Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa gave His Son a boon making Mahāviṣhṇu a million times greater than Himself and promising to place Him even higher than Himself. His Being would contain unlimited Brahmā, Viṣhṇu and Maheśha (Śhiva), and from His forehead Eleven Rudras would be created when the last day of destruction will come.<br />
Rādhā in Mary's Incarnation wanted to give Her Son the name of Her Lord, Kṛiṣhṇa. Kṛiṣhṇa comes from '<i>kṛiṣhi</i>' + '<i>ṇa</i>'. '<i>Kṛiṣhi</i>' means farming, '<i>ṇa</i>' means the one who carries. So the name 'Christ' came from the 'kṛiṣhi' in Kṛiṣhṇa. The name Jesus was derived from Jasodā, a form of Yeśhodā, the foster mother of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. Rādhā also wanted to give Yeśhodā's name to Her Son because of Yeśhodā's devotion and worship of Her in Vṛindāvan and Gokul. The abbreviation of Yeśhodā was 'Jesu' or 'Yesu', so Rādhā/Mary named Her Son Jesus Christ.<br />
In the life of Jesus Christ, the highest expression of the essence of spiritual innocence came onto Earth as God the Son. Human beings witnessed the sacrifice of the dearest and Only Son of the Father (Virāṭa) for humanity's sake. This allowed a deeper human perception of God's great love for the human race. The crucifixion of Christ happened at a time when people knew about God the Father, but did not know how to crucify their human self to allow the spiritual Self to express itself. This is the real meaning of the Resurrection of Christ: that man could be the physical witness of the immortality of the Spirit which does not suffer and never perishes. For the first time, human awareness registered the Truth of the immortality of Spirit which Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa had preached in His lifetime, which is recorded in the <i>Bhagavad Gītā</i> written by the poet Vyāsa.<br />
When one takes the name of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa one has to take the name of Rādhā first, so a seeker recites the mantra to the Virāṭa as 'Rādhā-Kṛiṣhṇa'. Similarly Sītā's name has to be taken before Rāma's for the mantra 'Sītā-Rāma'. Even the Virgin Mary (<i>Kanyā</i>) who was so quiet and potential at the time of Christ, was recognized later on by His disciples as the Power behind Him. She was worshiped for many years after Her death by early Christians. In modern times human beings who are satanic personalities are challenging the validity of the Primordial Mother's virginity and the Virgin Birth in particular. Mary has clearly shown the power of virginity that can raise a mother to such an exalted powerful position that she can conceive a child by desire alone. She had reached that high stage of evolution when by Her Divine Will, She could immaculately conceive. There are other such instances in Hindu purāṇik literature when Kuntī, by the wish of the Mantra, gave birth to the Pāṇḍavas and to Karṇa immaculately."</font><br />

Even more cunningly competent people overturned all the age-old cultural barriers. They flouted all ideas of a sense of chastity, and claimed they were all Incarnations of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa who Himself had tried to strip the gopīs naked. Actually Lord Kṛiṣhṇa at the innocent age of five began teasing the gopīs. As a child He had no awareness of sex. When Duryodhana later tried to molest the chastity of Draupadī, Kṛiṣhṇa, then King of Dvārakā, was the first to rush to Hastināpur (near Delhi) to defend Her honor."</font><br />

These two Deities are the evolved human Incarnations of Śhrī Viṣhṇu and Śhrī Gaṇeśha respectively. After this activity the Praṇava, which has divided into three, enters the spinal cord. Its lowest strand (Mahākālī or Gaurī Power) disappears into the sacrum as Kuṇḍalinī.<br />

The dangling chakra moves in a circle around the Nābhī chakra, creating an area called the Ocean of Illusion (Bhavasāgara) or the Void. Lord Viṣhṇu, through His ten Incarnations which represent the ten stages of the evolution of the Primordial Being (Virāṭa), crosses this Void. His seventh Incarnation was as Śhrī Rāma who resides on the right side of the Heart chakra with His Power, Śhrī Sītā. Rāma incarnated as the representation of a personality who was the perfect male human being (<i>Maryādā Puruṣhottama</i>). Lord Viṣhṇu's eighth Incarnation was as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa who, with His Power Rādhā, resides on the Viśhuddhi chakra. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was the ultimate expression of the Primordial Being (Virāṭa) in human form, and taught us to regard the Creation as a play (<i>Līlā</i>) of the Divine Power.<br />
In the brain above the Viśhuddhi, where the optic nerves cross each other, is the Āgñyā chakra, where Lord Jesus Christ resides in every human being. He is the complete manifestation of the Son God Principle. His body was formed from Śhrī Kārttikeya, the only brother of Śhrī Gaṇeśha and a Divine Personality. Although He came as a human being His Resurrection was made possible by the divine substance of His human body. In the Vaikuṇṭha Stage He was created as Mahāviṣhṇu, the only Son of Kṛiṣhṇa and Rādhā. As the ninth Incarnation of Viṣhṇu He was called Buddha or 'the mild Incarnation'. "</font><br />

The material energy of sound becomes absolutely divine only when a realized Soul creates it by percussion or by vocal means. For example, chanting mantras or talking to Deities by non-realized souls creates barriers for their communication with these Deities, who become very angry with such unauthorized practices. Human beings must understand that there is a protocol for approaching the Divine; ignorance of it is no excuse. For example, if a non-realized soul continues to chant the name of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, he may get throat problems, and ultimately even throat cancer. Sounds that are used for invoking Deities in temples, or in the worship of God by realized Souls or Yogis, are the sounds which carry or reflect Divine Vibrations. Mantras are divine sounds, and the poetic language of the Scriptures is based on the complete divine expression of the sound element. The Lord's Prayer and <i>Namas</i> are pure mantras. The Parsi <i>Avestha</i> Scriptures (of the followers of Zoroaster) and the Sanskrit <i>śhlokas</i> of the Hindus are all divine words which carry Divine Vibrations. If these words are uttered by non-realized people, they have no meaning and give no connection to God. If they are uttered by unholy people, these can fall victims to the anger of the Deities. Such individuals may fall into the subconscious or supraconscious realms. The Divine Power, the integrated energy, is expressed as the Word, also known as the Auṃ or Logos or <i>Anahalk</i>."</font><br />

<font color="red">"Then came Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa who was also born in a family not of Brahmins and not of Kṣhatriyas but of the milkmen who were not of high caste. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa himself from childhood performed so many miracles. His life displayed that the birth of a child in a particular family was not the determining factor as far as his 'jāti' or his caste was concerned. He used to go to Hastināpur and there instead of eating food or residing with people of high caste, he would live with the son of a maidservant who was Vidura, a realized Soul. Vidura was a low caste person but Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa would always go and visit and stay with him and have food in his house and not with the Kings of Hastināpur. But later on the caste system became based on the birth of a person. So the caste of a person was determined by the caste of the family in which he was born. Identification of a lower caste or a higher caste by birth was never the initial idea. Also the Goddess Durgā knew two classes, asuras or rākṣhasas (satanic) and bhaktas (devotees). It is difficult to say when Hindu society accepted this destructive caste system by birth. Perhaps some fanatic priests introduced this curse through religious books by their own alterations. This is a very common phenomenon in all the religious Scriptures where some fanatic or woman hater has put his own ideas. How can we take these Scriptures as pure or fundamental and follow them word by word?<br />
......<br />
So now we came to Jainism which has very amusing practices. First of all they want to save the lives of, in any case, all the worms, all the mosquitoes and all the bugs. It was said that they would take a hut and put a Brahmin inside that hut and they would then gather all the bugs of the village and put them also inside the same hut so that they might feed on the poor Brahmin who would suffer bug-bites for quite a while. When the bugs had completed sucking the blood of the poor Brahmin, they would get full with the blood and fall on their sides on the ground. Then only could the poor Brahmin come out of that hut. And he is given a lot of money for performing this sacrifice. I used to wonder why they used a Brahmin. Did they want Brahmin's pure blood to give spiritual life to the bugs as well? One notices so many things which are ridiculously absurd. How could they show Lord Mahāvīra like the way they show him, nude all over? Actually the story was like this. Śhrī Mahāvīra was in meditation and when he came out of that meditation half of his cloth was wrapped in a thorny bush (kunj). But he still had half his cloth upon his body. Then Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa wanted to test him. He came and asked him: "Why should you carry this piece of cloth on your body. You are a prince while I am a poor man. Why don't you give it to me." Śhrī Mahāvīra, in his generosity, gave the remaining cloth and walked into his palace which was very close by, covering himself with leaves. It was hardly for a few seconds when he had no clothes on his body. But he covered his private parts with leaves and walked inside his own palace. Now we find statues of nude Mahāvīra everywhere, with his private parts shown meticulously, as if Mahāvīra was nothing but his private parts. This really irritates any sensitive person. Why should they insult Lord Mahāvīra like this? If you notice the work of Michelangelo who has done the Sistine Chapel so well, he did not show Christ or Mother Mary or the Father, God without clothes. He showed other people, but never them. So it is very insulting to see a Great Incarnation like Lord Mahāvīra exhibited in the nude all over in India."</font><br />

Specially, these are the days of your marty[rdo]m. And I know about it, everything, what had happened to Hasan and Husayn. You all have done lot of penance for Them, and are still doing it. But now the time has come for all of you to know that Their sacrifice, Their kurbānī, has been completely fulfilled. After all, what did They want? They wanted whatever Their father, ʿAlī, wanted Them to do, also Their mother Fāṭimah. But we don't know, 'Who They were? What Incarnations They were? What was Their job?'<br />

We should understand why Muhammad Sāhab and ʿAlī worked so hard for us. What was so? What was so precious about us? They just not care for our mātam [mourning, lamentation, remembrance] but They wanted to make your life shine like a diamond, to make you Agents of the Divine so that you can transform people.<br />
......<br />
This is the experience you must have. I have to tell you the truth. This experience must be felt on your fingertips. And these fingers do not ... dunote [denote] as shown there, the different centers we have. This should happen tonight, tonight, by the grace of Muhammad Sāhab and ʿAlī. I am Their Agent, you can call Me. And that is what is My job: is to give you all you Self-realization.<br />
......<br />
According to Sahaj Yog, ʿAlī was an Incarnation on the second center.<br />
......<br />
Hazarat ʿAlī is the One who is the Incarnation of a Creator, who created the whole universe.<br />
N... now this truth can be proved! This truth can be proved! How? If you are a self-realized person, and your hands are speaking, then if you ask a question, `Was ʿAlī, Hazarat ʿAlī, was the One who created all this universe?', you start getting tremendous Cool Breeze.<br />

<font color="red">"Brahmadeva represents that aspect of God Almighty which manifests as the Creator of both the subtle side (esthetics), and of the gross side of material creation. Brahmadeva looks like an ascetic, a saintly personality, with a beard and mustache. He has four heads and all the hair on His heads is tied up in a top-knot. His body is thin with His most prominent feature being bulging and very large eyes. Brahmadeva rarely incarnates but He has incarnated once as Hazarat ʿAlī, husband of Fāṭimah and son-in-law of Muhammad Sāhib. Some ancient Sages tried to explain the meaning of His four heads as the expression of creation into four <i>Vedas</i>. The meaning of His heads is much wider and deeper, though. Brahmadeva is the symbol of the Creative Power of the Supreme, the Īśhwara, Brahma, God. This creative power is expressed through the plane of matter in this universe. All material things have three dimensions but there is a fourth dimension which only human beings can see and feel. This fourth dimension is the esthetic dimension created by balanced harmonies and the integration of different textures, forms and lines. Animals have no sense of beauty; only human beings can feel the esthetics of a composition of different colors, or the movement of lines and the melting of forms. The feelings of joy acquired through this esthetic sense create a <i>Rasa</i> (a secretion of the essence or juice of a feeling). This Rasa gives one a stimulative feeling that sets in motion waves of esthetic joy within the Inner Self. These joys are of different frequencies and vibrations. One does not need to dissect them but as I look at the different petals of this chakra, I shall try to explain the kinds of joys present in the realm of creativity expressed through divine enlightenment.

They have not even read the Qur'ān which was edited forty years after the death of Muhammad Sāhib. The editor himself was the most cruel man, who killed Hazarat ʿAlī, His two sons and two other Khalifas. It is said that the mother of this fifth Khalifa ate the raw liver of the fourth Khalifa. In this Jihād, how many Muslims are going to die? On one side they produce more children to create a Muslim majority and on the other side they are getting killed in thousands. The Jihād has become imminent and the Muslims are a real threat to peace and progress of every country they live in."</font><br />

[There is a strange tree, which stands without roots bears fruit without blossoming It has no branches and no leaves, it is lotus all over. Two birds sing there: one is the guru, and the other disciple. The disciple chooses the manifold fruits of life and tastes them, and the guru beholds him in joy.]<br />
<font color="red">"In the first stanza Bhakt Kabīr has talked about the Sahasrāra [limbic area in brain] and the infinite beauty and joy felt when Kuṇḍalinī reaches there<br />
In the second stanza 'Tree' symbolizes the Kuṇḍalinī and various chakras. Kabīr referred to Kuṇḍalinī as 'Surati' in many of the verses. His followers call this as 'Surati Yoga'." "</font><br />

<font color="red">"It is true, but you should forget about what you have read and just try to feel it. They spoke about the Kuṇḍalinī in metaphors or poetry but nobody wrote about it clearly. Perhaps they felt the time was not yet ripe. For instance, the Nāth Pānthis diligently guarded their knowledge and only passed it in the lineage of a master to a disciple. Gyānadeva could not give Realization to anybody. Same with other Saints like Kabīra, Tulasīdās, Ramaṇ Mahāṛiṣhi, Sufis and others. They were undoubtedly very great Saints. Whatever poetry they gave, people were singing, but that's all -- they did not know thyself. It was a very difficult situation because in modern times, like you, people only accept what is written in a book."</font><br />

I believe the vibrations come when your Sahasrāra starts moving. Kabīr Dās has said, "On the Top of the head the Anāhata [the unheard sound] beats." It means that just like the beating of heart the same happens at the top of the head.<br />

<font color="red">"This was how human beings paid homage to their Primordial Parents, God their Father and Ādi Śhakti their Mother, under the influence of these tāntrikas. They actually committed a sin against the virtue of chastity. Chastity is the power of Ādi Śhakti, the Primordial Mother, and everywhere tāntrikas have ruled, women were insulted and treated as a possession and a toy for the cruel enjoyment of men. The erotic images that mar these beautiful temples should not be taken as a sign that public opinion approved. It was the opinion of very few people, who ruled under hypnosis, that counted in those days, who were convinced they had achieved sexual liberation by delving into it. Many saintly people protested against the blackmail and the pornography of those times. There is historical evidence of uprisings against such kings who tried so hard to shame God.

Rāja Hariśhchandra, a noble king, was cruelly tortured by him. From Paraśhurāma's son onwards there was a steady stream of very hot tempered ascetics. It is hard to imagine how such people, devoid of any Divine Love, can achieve their salvation.<br />
They observed very strict abstinence and had nothing to do with sex. They did not believe in any family ties or involvements. If they had a guru who was a realized Soul he gave them the fatherly love they needed, and brought balance into their ascent. Macchindranāth, an Incarnation of Dattātreya, the Primordial Master, started <i>Nāth Pāntha</i>. There were some very feared gurus (<i>Avadhūtas</i>) of this cult even decades later. Its deterioration started, though, when tāntrikas imposed themselves as gurus, and took over the cult in many places. These fake gurus were criticized by the great Saint Kabīr Dās in His poems."</font><br />

<font color="red">"Unfortunately for many, like the friends of the Western gentleman who wanted to shout about truth from the rooftops, in Kali Yuga, seeking has developed its own momentum and people don't want to give up the activity of seeking, even when they come face to face with what they are looking for. In the film "Modern Times", when Charlie Chaplin has been working on a conveyor belt full of bolts, the activity of fixing the nuts creates such an inertia in his body that even when he has finished fixing the nuts and the conveyer belt had stopped moving, he still performs the same actions of fixing something with his hands. This really is an analogy of those people who are running in the rat race of seeking and just can't get out of the habit. In this way, the seeking of Truth has that inertia, which can no longer be controlled by putting the brake on, or pausing for a moment in order to listen to someone who really can say how one finds the Absolute Truth. But the knowers of Truth are always faced with blank incomprehension. As the poet Kabīr has said: "How can I explain what I know and see, when the whole world is blind". Of course, since Kabīr's time things have changed and at this present moment I cannot say that all the world is blind because there are thousands and thousands who have come with open minds to know about Absolute Truth through Kuṇḍalinī Awakening. Surprisingly there are quite a number of these realized Souls."</font><br />

<font color="red">"Then I turned to the question of shaving the head to get salvation. The great poet Kabīr has said about this: "If by shaving your head you get Nirvāṇa then what about the lamb which is shaved twice a year." Hearing my comments, the Hare Kṛiṣhṇa leader got very angry with me. I said: "Why are you angry with Me. I am your Mother, I am just asking you not to wear this dhotī in such cold weather because you will have problems with your legs." He said: "I am angry because you are criticizing my guru." I said: "I am not criticizing him, but I am just asking you a logical question." It is very surprising that these people should advised by their gurus to wear clothes which are suitable for the hot climate of India but totally unsuitable for the cold climate in America. This gentleman was very intelligent. He had read the Gītā very well and he talked about the Gītā. But I told him that in the Gītā it is not written anywhere that you should wear a dhotī or shave your head."</font><br />

<font color="red">"The Sufis in the real sense were realized Souls. In Turkey I met many who are seeking the Truth. The poetry of Yunus Einre is absolutely heavenly. How could he speak about the Global Religion and about Divine Love? He described man as the most elevated creature created by God in His image. In India we had Nizamuddin Auliyā, Amīr Khusaro, Moinuddin Chisti, Kabīr Dās, Śhrī Sāī Nāth Śhirḍī, Kāniphanāth, all saying the same Truth about global unity.<br />
......<br />
Once I found Myself in a very awkward situation when I went to Hastināpur with My husband, who was a collector of the Meerut district. There was some sort of a dispute between the two wings of the Jain religion. One is called Digambar, where they need not wear any clothes nor believe in saints who wear any clothes, because they are clothed by the directions like north, south, east and west. The second one, Śhvetāṃbar, believe in wearing white clothes, but cover their faces with a piece of cloth to prevent any germs from entering their body so that the germs may not be killed. Unfortunately we first went to the Digambar Temple and sat in the front row with all the paraphernalia of the collectorate, when 40 absolutely nude saints came and sat on the platform. It was a rude shock to me! I just put down my head and my husband went into a rage. These men were plucking their hair from their head and everywhere that was possible. For this the great poet Kabīr has said, "By plucking your hair if you think you can go to heaven or by shaving your head if you feel are going to heaven, then the sheep which is shaved twice a year will arrive in heaven much before yourself." So what is the use of trying these tricks. It is very interesting that they believe that if you go on plucking your hair then you attain the complete form of Jainism. All this drama really made my husband so furious that he got up from his seat and, holding my hand, walked out of that hall with all the paraphernalia of the collectorate behind us. My husband pushed me into the car and then got into the car. One man came running and asked him: "What's the matter. Why are you angry?" My husband said: "I cannot stand this unmannerliness, vulgarity, this insult." The driver had already started the car when he looked down and asked me: "Why did they do this to us?" I was already speechless with shame. I just said: "I did not know that the followers of the Great Lord Mahāvīra do this. I must, therefore, leave immediately". He said: "You know about religions and how do you not know about this kind of horrendous shock they give to others?" I confessed: "I know about religions but I do not know about their followers, who are just the opposite of their Masters who started those religions.""</font><br />

<font color="red">"Later on, in the sixteenth century many Saints existed who started talking and singing about Kuṇḍalinī, the channels and the subtle centers. All over India all these Saints talked about Self-knowledge, Self-realization (Ātma-sākṣhātkār). Some of the Saints tried to give Self-realization to their disciples but they actually gave it only to very few persons because they thought that the world was not yet ready to receive Self-realization. As Kabīra has written: "How am I to explain to these people, who are blind, about the light, mostly who are blind?""</font><br />

<font color="red">"According to me, Hazrate [Hazarat] Muhammad was one of the greatest incarnations because he was even greater than a Prophet. He announced some prophecies which none of the incarnations, such as Jesus, had described. The first thing he said was that we must have Meerraj [Mirāj], meaning the ascent through different levels. And at the third level he described how he met with all the previous Prophets such as Ibrahim, and he described the ascent on the white horse which is actually the power of Kundalini [Kuṇḍalinī]. Secondly, he said that when you receive your realization you have to fully surrender, meaning "Islam", and then your hands will speak. He did not condemn any previous religion or incarnation. For example, the Kabe Makeshwara [Kaaba Makkeśhwara] is also described in the Indian Koran [Qur'ān]. And thirdly, he described the next advent that is going to come. He never said that he was the last one. What shows that he never said he was the last is that he said that I am the seal, meaning that he was the stamp of the Prophets. He described the work of the advent of Mandi [Mahdī]. The word of Mandi [Mahdī] actually means the incarnation of the great primordial Mother -- Ma + Adi [Ādi]. No one has prophesised [prophesized] so clearly about Sahaja Yoga except for Hazrate [Hazarat] Muhammad who has described Sahaja Yoga in his great book of Koran [Qur'ān]."</font><br />

<font color="red">"In the life of Jesus Christ (incarnation of Maha Vishnu) the highest expression of the essence of spiritual innocence came on this earth. Human beings witnessed the sacrifice of the dearest and only son of the Father (Virata) for the sake of humanity. This allowed a deeper human perception for God's great love for humanity. The crucifixion of Christ happened at a time when people knew about Go almighty the Father but did not know how to crucify their human self to make the spiritual self express itself; tis is the meaning of the Resurrection of Christ by which man could be the physical witness of the immortality of the spirit which does not suffer or perish. The human awareness first time registered the truth of immortality of spirit which Krishna preached in his lifetime."</font><br />

<font color="red">"I have read a book about Jesus coming to India in Kashmir and meeting one of the Kings of Śhālivāhana. The meeting is quoted from an ancient book of Purāṇas, in Sanskrit, which perhaps, the writer doesn't know. It is written that Śhālivāhana King asked Jesus his name, and he said his name was Īsā Masīh and he asked him: "Why are you here in this country?" He said: "I have come from a country where people are 'Mlecchas'. Mlecchas are the people who have a desire to be only filthy or to be vulgar and immoral." In those days, foreigners were all called "Mlecchas" in India because Indians believed that they had no idea of purification or transformation. Whatever may be the case, this was the conversion between Śhālivāhana and Lord Jesus Christ. So Śhālivāhana asked him: "Why you do not go back and cleanse these people and teach them about Nirmal Tattwa?" (means the Principle of Cleansing). Thus, I think Christ went back and was crucified within three and a half years by the Romans who were not keen about their salvation. Now the way the Church of England is trying to support illegal marriages, etc., taking the support of the gene's theory shows how the Indians were right calling the Westerners "Mlecchas." I have dealt with this gene's theory in the chapter of Metascience.<br />
......<br />
Christ has said that you have to cleanse yourself, you have to control your attention and you have to see, through your introspection, what is wrong with you, and try to cleanse yourself. Otherwise, he said (in the chapter written by Matthew, in the Bible) "that if your one eye does the sin, (even if you look at a woman twice) you better take out your eyes. If your hand does anything wrong, anything sinful, cut out your hand." He said: if somebody slaps you on one cheek, to turn the other cheek to that person. Imagine Christians tolerating even one slap on the face?<br />
When you see the Christian people in the Christian nations, the way they killed people all over the world, one wonders, by what yard-stick they call themselves Christians. One can very well understand that these are all absolutely impossible rules and regulations for the advanced modern persons to follow. These hard rules may not have been propagated by Christ, but may have been introduced by Paul who was a squatter in the Bible and who edited it. He was epileptic according to the Principles of Sahaja Yoga. He was possessed and wrote all kinds of lies through Peter who was the weakest disciple of Christ. How could Christ give him the keys to build a church on seven hills? On the contrary, He said: "The Satan will take you over". Who is this Satan? The anti-Christ.<br />
It's not possible for anybody to be worthy of the Christian religion because they have to be extremely sensitive to sinful actions like Saints or angels. I haven't seen anybody with a cut hand or with eyes missing in the whole of the Christian kingdom. This proves that their belief in Christ is followed only up to the point of going to the church, listening to the sermons preached by a person who is not even a realized Soul, and who has not had his Divine Baptism.<br />
It is very surprising, because our mayor in Italy asked me: "How is it there are so many people attending your program for hours together. They never get bored. While when we are in the church, after fifteen minutes, we start looking at our watches, and after half an hour, we just run out of the church. It is just a social event but it so very boring that after the lecture we feel like going to the pub, otherwise we start fighting with each other." After the blessing of the Trinity, why should they be so anxious to drink and get lost?<br />
Thus, we find that, in the Christian countries, people are behaving in an absolutely opposite manner to what Christ had asked them to do. He had gone into a very subtle side of purity that says, "Thou shall not have adulterous eyes" while in the Ten Commandments, it was only said: "Thou shall not commit adultery". If you are observant, you will be shocked to see that it is very hard to find any man or woman in the Western countries who does not have adulterous eyes. Of course it is different, if they are blind, or too old to flirt with their eyes. They are always moving their eyes from one person to another person with lust or greed. It's impossible to understand how they can move their attention so fast from one person to another, unless some screws are loose in their brains, like a doll, which has screws that control the eye balls. The eyes start moving very fast like flirts. They might become mad or get possessed by one thing or another. In fruitless pursuit, how can the human attention be so mobile?<br />
After Christ came Muhammad Sāhib, and perhaps He felt that if all these rules and regulations were written down they were only for men. But what about the women? So He said something should be done about the women. If they follow an absolutely moral path, then men will be also automatically moral. He respected holy women. He had great respect for Christ's Mother and also for women as a whole. In the Bible She is called as an ordinary woman. The idea of Madonna came from the Pagan religion which existed before Christ. But Muhammad Sāhib, who was the Incarnation of the Primordial Master (Prophet), knew who was the Mother of Christ. In Sahaja Yoga She is worshiped as Mahālakṣhmī. He did not want many women to be immoral and take to prostitution. For a married woman, there are very strict punishments. It is said that in the Qur'ān He said: "Any woman, who is immoral, must be buried in the sand halfway and should be stoned," (sometimes, she could be dead.) I wonder if He said such a thing, or if it was Muʿāwiyah [ibn Abī Sufyān] who edited the Qur'ān. But the way they follow it in the Islamic countries is really sinful to give this kind of punishment to all those who are considered immoral women. Whatever it is, it is very difficult, in these modern times, to find very moral people after the pattern that Muhammad Sāhib thought.<br />
He accepted many marriages because He didn't want women to have relationship without marriage. In those days, there were many women who survived after the death of their husbands, in the wars they had among the tribes. There were many young girls who had no chance of marriage, as many young people were killed in the wars they had in the different tribes against Muhammad Sāhib. Whatever He did at that time (samayāchār), was very essential to create a new generation of very pure and compassionate people. Both Jesus Christ and Muhammad Sāhib were not only divine but they were Incarnations who had a Special Mission to come on this Earth.
......<br />
Now, in Islamic fundamentalism, the main problem Is that they say they are fighting the Western culture. Firstly, we must understand that Western culture, which today is nowhere near what Christ has talked about. Immorality has become the lifestyle of human beings in the West, but what about the immorality the Muslims are indulging in secretly whenever they get the chance? They can be worse than Christians.<br />
......<br />
In these nations, in their private life, or in society can one find that they try to imbibe the great qualities that our Lord Jesus Christ has taught? Only in name are they followers of Christ; for political control, they use religions without any substance of these great religions. All of them are making money and are not willing to accept the universal pure innate religion, which is the fountain-head of all these religions. Their own standard of understanding moral life is really very shocking. For example, they believe in heavy drinking, because they say that in the Christian religion, drinking is allowed as Christ went to a wedding and there he made wine out of water. The word "wine" is used in the Hebrew language, even for grape juice, and also for grape wine.<br />
How did they interpret that he made Benedictine, French wine or Scotch Whisky. It is very simple to understand the logic that you cannot create alcoholic wine in a short time spontaneously. It has to ferment, and then it becomes a very good, expensive alcoholic wine that can cause intoxication. If it is a very, very old smelly, rotten wine, one can sell it for a very high price. This is not the same wine that was created by Christ at all. It is very easy to understand that he was constantly preaching for a higher awareness. Therefore how could he try to subscribe something like alcoholic intoxicating wine, which is anti-spiritual in nature and which reduces awareness.<br />
In Canada, I met a scholar who had a doctorate from some English university. To my surprise, he had written a thesis on how alcohol creates more awareness for Divinity. Moreover, many people in Europe believe that by taking drugs they can get a very high awareness to achieve their divine ascent. It is all absurdity to the last limit, but who can tell them. They can't talk to you after six o'clock anyway, especially in France, as they all start drinking quite early. It is impossible to understand why all these people have taken to drinking in the name of religion and even when they give the communion to God, which they call in their language, Holy Communion (it is given with wine and some sort of rotten bread). How can any one believe that this wine and alcohol, which makes a person so sick and causes so many diseases and which is so dangerous for children to consume, has something to do with the divine ascent, because it is the blood of Christ, our Lord. What an insult to the great life of Jesus, who was a pure Incarnation for innocence, Logos or Auṃ.<br />
......<br />
On the whole, if you see, Western culture denies Christ who sacrificed his life for the sins of the people. Those who call themselves Christians indulge in all kinds of activities which are anti-Christ. When Christ came into this world in the Realm of Divinity, one had to go through penance (tapasyā). Buddha and Mahāvīra had to do the same at that time. Christians do not know what is penance and they cannot sacrifice even a pin for others. They are very good at lip service. Big conferences are held in the developing nations for monetary help, who pay for these conferences and the outcome is that nothing can be done for the poor countries while Westerners spend their superfluous money on all kinds of waste.<br />
......<br />
Ego is against Christ. As they don't respect themselves they also do not respect others. Thus, the people in the West are extremely egoistical and arrogant. They feel that if somebody is humble, he is a weak person, while Christ has said: "The meek will inherit the Earth." They advertise openly about their ego and what things can please their ego. I have seen advertisements about smoking stating that it makes you look egoistical. The training of children in the West is to develop the ego and also, very surprisingly, children are told to grab things from others rather than to share with others. I am talking about democratic countries where there is no understanding of compassion and humility, although they are Christians they do not practice Christianity.<br />
So the fundamentalists of the Christian religion have now become a new type, those who believe in a new culture of people. They go to church with their skin heads and on their return they kill Hindu ladies who wear kumkum (mask of marriage). They worship Christ and call themselves "dot-busters" and look like lousy vagabonds. They never wear any suits anymore, neither do they have any proper dresses. They wear the same clothes for the whole year and hold very high positions in the media or in other organizations. People laugh at a person who is not in this kind of lousy, shabby, repulsive attire. One has to appear rustic and innocent like a primitive villager, while the brain is ultramodern. Islamic fundamentalists are fighting these Western modern fundamentalists who believe in all kinds of absurd modernism.<br />
Even in art, in writing and also in expression in different types of literature, you find that books which are popular are usually very grotesque.<br />
France is full of these ideas and perhaps all these ideas really come from France, where the politicians, at a very high position, have keeps. There is no ideal for the people to follow. Idealism ended with Marie Antoinette, who was killed by the public, who themselves, had become bourgeois. All their lives have changed and they have taken to all the mannerisms of the bourgeois which they condemned and therefore hanged their king and queen. Thus, we have a society of very licentious and vulgar people. The qualities that were very important in the West were given by Christ, but nobody cared for them.<br />
......<br />
Actually Hazarat Muhammad never made Islam an exclusive religion in the Qur'ān. He very respectfully talked about Moses, Abraham, Christ and His Mother, one after another. Even so Muslims believe they are exclusive. Jews and Christians also believe theirs are exclusive religions. There is another problem -- they believe that Muhammad was the exclusive messenger of God and Christians believe that Christ is the last word, while Jews believe that their Savior has yet to come. If these Incarnations were the last ones why did Muhammad say, "I will send you the Twelfth Mahdī?" Also why did Christ say that He would send the Holy Ghost? We cannot say how long the Jews are going to wait for their Savior to come. They are wailing and crying before the wailing wall wearing the Torah in small amulets, but actually the most important thing for them is to collect the money that they have lent and buy diamonds at any cost.<br />
......<br />
The Christians are converted in India. They usually come from very poor back grounds. They believe that Christ was an Englishman born in Buckingham Palace. There is a joke about a villager near Allahabad. He was converted and given the name Sikander (Alexander), so he became Alexander Bhura. Bhura was his own name meaning Blondy. Every time he came to Allahabad, he would go for a dip in the Holy River, the Ganges. The missionaries who converted him said that now that had become a Christian he could not worship the River Ganges. He was amazed at this absurd proposal and said in his village language: "I have become sāhib, but how can I leave my religion (dharma)?"<br />
......<br />
Now we find statues of nude Mahāvīra everywhere, with his private parts shown meticulously, as if Mahāvīra was nothing but his private parts. This really irritates any sensitive person. Why should they insult Lord Mahāvīra like this? If you notice the work of Michelangelo who has done the Sistine Chapel so well, he did not show Christ or Mother Mary or the Father, God without clothes. He showed other people, but never them. So it is very insulting to see a Great Incarnation like Lord Mahāvīra exhibited in the nude all over in India."</font><br />

<font color="red">"I have met many people who cannot accept the Truth because of their ego. Once a very rude and arrogant interviewer from the television came to interview me. Of course, most of them are brought up that way so one should criticize their stupidity. Now this one was very special. He asked me what was I doing in London or England. He said I should help my own poor, India. I told him: "I am not here of my choice but as my husband has been elected to a UN post with headquarters in London, I have to be with him. But I am in India every year at least for half a year". Very humbly I asked him: "Who is responsible for India's poverty? If a country has "guests" for three hundred years without any visa or immigration, how can you expect such a country to be rich? While all the wealth is sucked out of India without any consideration, who do you think will become poor and who will become rich?" He felt quite upset with this answer from an ordinary Indian housewife. Then he asked another question: "Why do you have such a large population in India?" I said very calmly: "Sir, I may say that for this overpopulation also perhaps you are responsible." The ego explosion of this English interviewer was really worth viewing in silence. He jumped with temper: "How do you put the blame on us for your mad population?" To this I answered with great peace. I said: "Sir, I read in the newspaper that in England, sorry, in London itself, two legal children are killed by their parents every week. So sir, please tell me which sane child would like to be born in a country where there is not an atmosphere of love for the children. Even the neighbors do not like children. If one has children one may not get a flat on rent. Perhaps children are very happy to be born in India to loving and caring parents. Children do not want to know what bank account one has. They want love which is the most valuable thing". All this answering made him mad with fury. So he attacked me: "I am told you do not take any money for Self-realization work. This no Anglo-Saxon brain can understand." I answered him very politely: "Sir, how much can you pay for Divine Love? How much did you pay to Christ? By the way can I now ask you a question?" He said: "Yes, go ahead". I asked: "Will you tell me which God has made this special Anglo-Saxon brain?" That settled him. He walked out with his gear and cameraman who never took any photographs. Later on people told me about him, and that he is called a Bulldog, even in the media.<br />

For example, the war in Bosnia is the misidentification of Croats, Muslims and Serbs. They follow the Christian and Muslim religions. The Croats are Catholic Christians but do they follow Christ? What about Muslims who believe in the Formless God and despite this fight for land? Actually, Muhammad never talked of an exclusive religion. He talked about Abraham, Moses and Christ in a series and the fourth was Himself. Even Christ talked about Abraham and Moses. Why do people who follow Moses, Christ or Muhammad fight? They have the same roots. At least these three religions should produce people who understand the oneness of their religions. Of course, the Hindu religion is not exclusive. It accepts all the religions but even Hindus in charge of religious affairs have made different laws for different religions. They are taking advantage of the minorities for votes in the Democracy."</font><br />

<font color="red">"For example, some of them project a kind of missionary in a developing country who collects money by showing off Christ's compassion, etc. all the time. Substantial donations are collected and these are perhaps shared with the media. Altogether, this seems to be a profitable business. The media can build up even a Nobel Prize-winning image. No one knows where all this money is going and what is happening. There are no properly audited accounts. People who are sensitive, especially those in the West get very impressed by such persons. Once a missionary came to a conference and started saying: "You must think about the poorest of poor, you must take something out of your lunch for the poorest of poor" and so on and so forth. All the Western people in the audience heard these three or four sentences and, to our amazement, they started crying. They donated so much money to that missionary, and it is said that this missionary collects people from the streets, baptizes them, and converts them into Christians. Those who fall sick and die are buried or cremated unceremoniously. The media are promoting the images of such missionaries practically in every developing country.<br />

Muhammad Sāhib has talked about Abraham, Moses, Christ in a series as They came one after the other. He has talked about the Mother of Christ especially with great respect. In the Bible She is not given so much respect because of Paul who edited the Bible. She is just called "the woman". But Prophet Muhammad says that anyone who talks against this Holy Lady will be punished, or something to that effect. So one can see that Muhammad Sāhib never talked of an exclusive religion called "Islam" (i.e., I surrender to God Almighty). But so many followers of Islam are fighting the followers of other religions and even amongst themselves.<br />

<font color="red">"Śhrī Gaṇeśha establishes within you the higher self. The baser self which enjoys all baser things of lives are If you see Mona Lisa, I don't know, she cannot be an actress, she cannot be in any beauty contest. Her face is very serene, very motherly, very pure, her eyes, and that's why it is that she is eternally so much appreciated? The reason is, there is Gaṇeśha Principle in her. She's a mother. The story about that one is that this lady had lost her child and she would never smile, she would never cry and one little child was brought to her. She saw the child, and then the smile that came on her face of that love for the child is being depicted by this great artist, that's why people are appreciating it. You have seen in the West though the people don't show much interest in the mother-child relationships, anywhere you go, the mother and child theme is the best. They will show you a photograph, this is Mother and Child. This is Christ's Mother and Child. When Christ was brought down, the Mother is there. They have to have Mother and the Child Principle acting otherwise that picture is not regarded as something great. Or you have to have actually Christ who is a Gaṇeśha Principle Himself, to be shown. I haven't seen any picture as such of those days where these principles are not there. Even Picasso has used it. Even people who have been quite modern had to use this principle to popularize. But some people had used to popularize not the Gaṇeśha Principle, just anti-Gaṇeśha principles. "</font><br />

<font color="red">"During the Tretā Yuga, at the time of Śhrī Rāma, Ādi Śhakti incarnated in three separate human personalities, expressing Her three aspects:<br />
&emsp;1. Sītā [Jānakī] (Mahālakṣhmī) as the daughter of Rāja Janaka<br />
&emsp;&emsp;This was the first absolute human form (<i>Laukik</i>)"</font><br />

<div class="para-divider"></div>

<p>
<font color="red">"Maheśha (Śhiva), Viṣhṇu and Brahmadeva form the Trinity which incarnated as one teacher God, the Primordial Master, Dattātreya. He came onto this Earth to teach people the secrets of the Divine, to reveal God, and to help them cross the Ocean of Illusion themselves within their own identity. Evolution could not go further in the hands of human beings who were in the bondage of ignorance, so they were given guidance through this Incarnation of the Primordial Master (Ādi Guru) again and again in different lives. He was created as the three-headed child, Dattātreya, by Ādi Śhakti who appeared on Earth during the Tretā Yuga as Satī Anasūyā, wife of the Sage Atreya. He was born as Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara] who founded Jainism -- one of the oldest religions. Then he was born as Rāja Janaka, father of Jānakī also called Sītā, Rāma's wife. She was an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti.<br />
The Primordial Master was also born as Macchindranāth, and again as Zoroaster who was worshiped by the ancient Persians, and still revered by Parsis. Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism. In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates. He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā). Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918. Altogether there were ten major Avatāras of Dattātreya.<br />
It is very important to understand that until the animal stage there was no need for animals to solve the problem of life, as animals were under the complete command of God. At the human stage, however, as we learn from the history of Adam and Eve, they were given the choice and freedom to solve the problem of life. That was how evolution was to go a step further. Without such freedom human beings were not equipped to learn the secrets of Divine Power.<br />
Ādi Viṣhṇu Himself took His seventh Incarnation during the Tretā Yuga as Lord Rāma, a human being who crossed the Ocean of Illusion and touched a new dimension of awareness. As Śhrī Rāma, Ādi Viṣhṇu came to enlighten human social and political consciousness as the true model of what Plato, thousand of years later, would call 'the philosopher king'. He settled for human beings the rules of socio-political correct action (<i>samāj tatha rājkaraṇ dharma</i>). He also expressed God's aspect of majesty and order within kingship and institutions, and led a life of an ideal human being (<i>Maryādā Puruṣhottama</i>). This was witnessed by multitudes, resulting in a mass awareness for the first time among human beings. Śhrī Rāma was the ideal King for all kings, and <i>Rām Rājya</i>, His kingdom, was the ideal kingdom.<br />
He reached a point in the Primordial Heart Chakra (Ādi Anāhata Chakra) crossing the Void along the central path (Ādi Suṣhumṇā Nāḍī). His wife Sītā was an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. The <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i>, the epic about Lord Rāma's exploits written by Vālmīki, tells how Lord Rāma was made to forget that He was the Reincarnation of Ādi Viṣhṇu for some time, because it was desired that He should act absolutely like a human being, to make them feel absolutely free with him. He gave them a human leadership. Later on, when Sītā disappeared back into the Mother Earth, Lord Rāma remembered His divinity.<br />
At the time of Rāma's Incarnation Ādi Śhakti existed in three persons: Mahālakṣhmī, as Sītā, His wife; Mahāsaraswatī, as Satī Anasūyā who gave birth to Dattātreya, the Primordial Master; and Mahākālī as Mandodarī, the wife of the demon Rāvaṇa.<br />
......<br />
The Incarnations of Rādhā show how the ideas of human beings gradually changed. The life as Rādhā was definitely a peg above in social advancement in the dogmatic thinking of society, compared to the time of Sītā. She was not married to Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa in a formal human way (<i>laukika</i>). Their wedding was divine (<i>alaukika</i>), and was performed spiritually and socially in the presence of many people by Brahmadeva. Earlier, as Sītā, although formally married to Rāma in a wedding ceremony that was collectively sanctioned, She was still condemned by society. Kṛiṣhṇa's love and adoration of Rādhā brought Her glory without marriage, while Sītā was denied that public acceptance even though She was the legal wife of Rāma.<br />
Princess Sītā was married to King Rāma in a very traditional way. When He went into exile, Rāvaṇa the rākṣhasa, Satan disguised as an ascetic, appeared before Her and took Her away to the capital of his kingdom in Lanka. Rāma fought a war with Rāvaṇa to rescue His wife, who was secluded by Rāvaṇa in the core of his island kingdom. Rāma defeated His enemy and brought Sītā back to His kingdom, Ayodhyā. Although She was the purest of the pure, and the holiest of the holy, She was treated with suspicion by the citizens of Ayodhyā, Rāma's capital city. They would not accept Her as queen, blaming Her for having been abducted by force by Rāvaṇa. The suspicious citizens questioned Her chastity, and committed collective sin by rejecting Her. Although She was pregnant Rāma was forced to forsake Her. She lived with the Saint Vālmīki in the jungles of Bihar State where She gave birth to twin boys, Lava and Kuśha. They were absolutely human personalities but of very great spiritual heritage from previous births. Sītā taught them the divine way of life. They were later born again in Bihar as Gautama, known as Lord Buddha, and as Śhrī Mahāvīra, the leader of the great religion, Jainism. This all happened 500 years before the birth of Christ. Internally they reached a very great height through these births. They preached the doctrine of nonviolence (<i>ahiṃsā</i>) which was later developed into an extreme form of vegetarianism. They took birth in the warrior caste (<i>Kṣhatriya</i>) rather than as fanatical Brahmins in order to keep away from the extremes of vegetarian abstinences, and to stay more balanced. Still their disciples carried their teachings to the extreme of abstinence and vegetarianism. They confused inner asceticism (<i>saṃnyāsa</i>) with organized institutions of asceticism, and nonviolence with vegetarianism. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was later very much criticized by the so-called vegetarian followers of Buddha and Mahāvīra.<br />
Later They were born in Arabia as Hasan and Husayn, the two sons of Fāṭimah, daughter of Muhammad Sāhib. They were murdered in a very violent war at Karbalāʾ. Their death signifies a great sacrifice in the name of religion. It is an indication how people who are extreme in nature take to fanaticism and, in their blindness, kill the very essence of religion that is born in flesh and blood as an Incarnation. This awakening gave a rude shock to the mass of religious human beings of the land, and there ensued a phenomenon of mass repentance. In this way people were made to realize that there can be no attachment to war for a realized Soul. Violence and nonviolence are attributes of mind but awareness is beyond these extremes. In defense of righteousness one has to go to war, but when one becomes the witness one only sees the play of war without taking any credit or discredit for it, or being disturbed by its aggression.<br />
After Fāṭimah, the Reincarnation of Sītā, died, sectarian war broke out among the Muslims. One side, the Shiya sect, was founded by Her; in Indian dialect Sītā is pronounced 'Shiya'. They are known today as Shiites. Shiya women are regarded as fair, innocent and beautiful because of their motherly expressions; in the same way the women of Janakapur, Sītā's birthplace in India, are similarly blessed by Mahālakṣhmī.<br />
After Her Incarnation as Sītā She was born and lived in China as Kuan Yin [Guānyīn], the Mother of Mercy, as a virgin. Ādi Śhakti took Her first Incarnation in Nepal where still today the Goddess is the presiding national Deity. Most of Her births were on the Himalayas near Nepal where people have mixed Indian and Chinese features. The women of Nepal are mostly fair and soft skinned, and are known to be very serene and beautiful. Because of their high cheek bones they look very young all the time. Ādi Śhakti's facial expression is very much in this mold; to be precise She looks Nepali.<br />

When one takes the name of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa one has to take the name of Rādhā first, so a seeker recites the mantra to the Virāṭa as 'Rādhā-Kṛiṣhṇa'. Similarly Sītā's name has to be taken before Rāma's for the mantra 'Sītā-Rāma'. Even the Virgin Mary (<i>Kanyā</i>) who was so quiet and potential at the time of Christ, was recognized later on by His disciples as the Power behind Him. She was worshiped for many years after Her death by early Christians. In modern times human beings who are satanic personalities are challenging the validity of the Primordial Mother's virginity and the Virgin Birth in particular. Mary has clearly shown the power of virginity that can raise a mother to such an exalted powerful position that she can conceive a child by desire alone. She had reached that high stage of evolution when by Her Divine Will, She could immaculately conceive. There are other such instances in Hindu purāṇik literature when Kuntī, by the wish of the Mantra, gave birth to the Pāṇḍavas and to Karṇa immaculately."</font><br />

The other Deities remain on their different centers:<br />
&emsp;1. <i>Sahasrāra chakra</i> &#8211; Ādi Śhakti Herself<br />
&emsp;2. <i>Āgñyā chakra</i> &#8211; Jesus Christ + His Mother Mary<br />
&emsp;3. <i>Viśhuddhi chakra</i> &#8211; Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa + Śhrī Rādhā<br />
&emsp;4. <i>Anāhat chakra</i> &#8211; Śhrī Rāma + Śhrī Sītā (right side) Śhrī Śhiva + Śhrī Pārvatī (left side), Śhrī Jagadambā (Durgā) in the center<br />

The dangling chakra moves in a circle around the Nābhī chakra, creating an area called the Ocean of Illusion (Bhavasāgara) or the Void. Lord Viṣhṇu, through His ten Incarnations which represent the ten stages of the evolution of the Primordial Being (Virāṭa), crosses this Void. His seventh Incarnation was as Śhrī Rāma who resides on the right side of the Heart chakra with His Power, Śhrī Sītā. Rāma incarnated as the representation of a personality who was the perfect male human being (<i>Maryādā Puruṣhottama</i>). Lord Viṣhṇu's eighth Incarnation was as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa who, with His Power Rādhā, resides on the Viśhuddhi chakra. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was the ultimate expression of the Primordial Being (Virāṭa) in human form, and taught us to regard the Creation as a play (<i>Līlā</i>) of the Divine Power."</font><br />

<font color="red">"The Heart Center has three parts:<br />
<br />
&emsp;1. On the left side of the Chakra, Pārvatī resides with Her husband, Lord Śhiva. He governs the left side channel of Iḍā nāḍī.<br />
&emsp;2. On the right side of the Chakra is the seat of Lord Rāma, an Incarnation of Ādi Viṣhṇu, and His wife, Sītā, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti.<br />
&emsp;3. Pārvatī enters alone into the central part of the Chakra as Durgā or Jagadambā, Mother of the World. When Ādi Viṣhṇu incarnated as Lord Rāma, this central part was vacated by Durgā who, in Her role as wife, rejoined Lord Śhiva in the left chamber whilst Lord Rāma with Sītā occupied the central chamber.<br />
......<br />
<b>The fourth center of Anāhat</b><br />
<br />
Is governed by Ādi Śhakti (the Goddess) as Durgā or Jagadambā whose sustenance is Universal Motherly Love. The left part of this Chakra governed by Śhiva and Pārvatī has the sustenance of existence, of innocence, simplicity and steadfastness. The right part of the Chakra is governed by Śhrī Rāma and His dedicated wife, Sītā, and has the sustenance of majesty, and His perfect political leadership. This couple symbolizes the steadfast love between husband and wife."</font><br />

<font color="red">"Those people who do not respect their parents and their elders always have a weak Mūlādhāra chakra when they come to Sahaja Yoga. They also have a very weak right Heart center (Anāhata chakra) where Śhrī Rāma resides with His wife, Sītā. If they are particularly unkind to their mothers, then the center and right Heart gets very weak. We must therefore understand just how important our parents are, and how the spiritual link is held in the inner being of personality. Our parents have their roots in the Primordial Parents, and marriage has its roots in their primordial and eternal loving relationship. Those who do not respect their marriage, or enjoy the glory of their chastity, also suffer from a very weak Heart center and Mūlādhāra chakra. In such shameless, sex-obsessed people the Kuṇḍalinī just does not rise."</font><br />

<font color="red">"Later on Śhrī Rāma who was one of the Incarnations on this Earth, showed in his own life that he respected people for their aptitude. For example when Śhrī Rāma was exiled and went to a forest, he met there a poor old woman called Śhabarī who was of tribal caste. She offered some berries to Śhrī Rāma with great affection and devotion. She said: "Please eat them because they are not at all sour. I have already tasted them." The food or fruits tasted by somebody else are not to be eaten (uttiṣhṭa). If someone has bitten off even a part of a fruit, that fruit is no longer pure and cannot be offered to another person, certainly not to an Incarnation. But Śhrī Rāma was greatly moved by the love of the old lady. He accepted the berries with much joy and ate them. He praised their taste and gave some to his wife, Sītā. His brother Lakṣhmaṇ, felt rather jealous and asked for some berries for himself. There are many incidents where Śhrī Rām gets very friendly with people who were not of very high castes. Also his own Rāmāyaṇa, his life story, was written by a fisherman who was a dacoit. This fisherman was transformed into a Saint by another heavenly minstrel called Nārada. Of course an ordinary fisherman who was also a dacoit had such respect for Śhrī Rāma that he wrote this beautiful epic, the Rāmāyaṇa."</font><br />
