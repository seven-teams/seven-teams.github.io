"To make the people cross the Void (Bhavasāgara) He has to make some arrangement. So the Great Power like Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, Maheśha was created and They were placed in the Area of Dharma.<br />
<font color="red">Dattātreya and Ādi Gurus incarnated in this world many a times. He incarnated as King Janaka who was like the father of Ādi Śhakti. After that He incarnated in Iran as Zoroaster, then as Macchindranāth, then as Muhammad Sāheb and Nāṇak Sāheb.</font><br />
No one fought with each other. See what type of darkness you are in?<br />
Fāṭimah, the daughter of Muhammad Sāheb was the same who became daughter of King Janaka.<br />
Whom are you fighting? Think over it.<br />
The Nāṇakī of Guru Nāṇaka was none else but Jānakī.<br />
Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth was also an Ādi Guru.<br />
<font color="red">They are the Masters of all.<br />
Also, They are My Gurus. These Ādi Gurus taught Me all this Knowledge. In different Incarnations They kept Me teaching.<br /> 
Ultimately I had to come and do His work. They could not do it and now They are placing Me as a Guru so that I take up the job of a Guru.<br />
There was an age when no one was willing to accept a woman as a Guru but in Kali Yuga only Mother could do His work: it is beyond the power of men.</font><br />
This work could not be done by force, only the love of a Mother could do it because already there is so much pressure, tension in this world. The day it is forced upon the human being they will break down. So, love is the only way out.<br />
So this Gurudom was given to Me. Everything is acceptable to Me.<br />
But I didn't know the qualities of a Guru.<br />
Gurus maintain distance but mother does not keep distance with the children. Children sit on her head.<br />
So, you people also could take liberty with Me and enjoy. Be with Me with full freedom, you will neither be afraid nor be embarrassed. There is no problem, you could come and talk to Me boldly about your problems. You could complain to Me as you do to your mother. I am freely available to you.<br />
Freedom was needed, religion was required to be discussed openly, there is no secret, no secret about it. Ultimately everything has to be explained very clearly. All the secrets are to be told about, everything could not be said everywhere."<br />

"But before reaching the Heart chakra, the gap I showed you, is all the Bhavasāgara. In the center is the seat of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, and on it Śhrī Brahmadeva creates the whole universe. He made this Bhavasāgara.<br />
After creating the Bhavasāgara, the question was, 'How to cross it over? The human being was created, but how to make him realize it? How to make human beings recognize it? In him, how to activate the Brahma Tattwa?' Meaning, 'How to get the Union of Śhiva and Śhakti within him? How would the connection be established?'<br />
For this, a special personality was created in this world. This was created by the combined essence of Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, and Maheśh, who we acknowledge as Śhrī Dattātreya. Śhrī Dattātreya is none other than Ādi Guru.<br />
He is My Guru. He has mentored Me all His past lives.<br />
If you hear about His birth and all His previous lives you would be amazed. We have forgotten such a great thing.<br />
Śhrī Dattātreya's Incarnations are numerous. Firstly He came as King Janaka. Śhrī Sītājī was His daughter, who was the embodiment of Śhakti Herself. <font color="red">Then He came as Macchindranāth, Zoroaster, and Muhammad Sāhab, who were a completely different type of human being.<br />
They trialed out lots of different things.</font><br /> 
Śhrī Datta, the Primordial Masters firstly in this world educated us about the symbolic forms within us. And then also said that, "You people got entangled in symbolism, in idol worshiping." Their meaning was to go beyond and recognize the Śhakti within these idols. That's why They talked about the idols.<br />
<font color="red">For example, there is a flower, and to describe the honey within the flower, They talked about the flower first, from which the people would taste the honey. But people got stuck to flower. So Then they took Incarnations and talked about the honey.<br />
In that, They talked about God in the abstract. They deliberately didn't talk about the reincarnation of life.</font><br />
Because as soon as you talk about past lives, people ask Me, "Mātājī, tell me about my past lives." The life that has passed, why do you want to know that? Whether you were a king or a pauper, what difference it will make?<br />
<font color="red">That's why They did not discuss past lives.</font><br />
Muhammad Sāhab was the same, Dattātreya's Incarnation, and the same Incarnation was King Janaka. The same Incarnation was Nāṇaka, whose sister Nāṇakī, was the same Ādi Śhakti. She was Sītājī."<br />

"The same Śhrī Dattā incarnated many a times on the Earth.<br />
As I told you yesterday, King Janaka was one of Them. King Janaka was the father of Jānakī [Śhrī Sītā]. He was none other than the Incarnation of Śhrī Dattātreya.<br />
Thereafter, Macchindranāth, most have you must have heard His name, was also His Incarnation.<br />

"Another thing is, here in Bhavasāgar, all Three, Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, Maheśhwar, combined to make a child, who is called Ādi Guru, is known as Dattātreya. There were many Incarnations of Him. And His Child Tattwa also took Incarnations. First was Dattātreya, then came Rāja Janak. <font color="red">Like this, many Incarnations came, Rāja Janak, Nāṇak, Zarathustra, Muhammad Sāhab, Sāī Nāth of Śhirḍī.<br />
They are all one. Are They or not?</font> You can witness it after Self-realization. If you believe in one Guru, like Nāṇak, then you have no right not to accept Muhammad Sāhab. If you get Muhammad Sāhab and not Nāṇak, then you have no authority as well.<br />
You will be surprised, most of the cancer disease comes from the imbalance of Bhavasāgar, you follow one but not the other. Cancer also comes when we don't follow Them.<br />
Like He forbade two things, like not to smoke a cigarette and not to consume alcohol.<br />
Alcohol is entirely not allowed. Here, in Sahaja Yoga, if someone is habituated to drink alcohol, they will leave it. If they don't leave alcohol, it will [not] be in moderation because both of these things go against Guru Tattwa.<br />
If Guru Tattwa is not established within us, we cannot have our evolution. Guru Tattwa is essential. Guru Tattwa is one destiny for all religions. There is one flow from all the religions."<br />

"So the dharma that has been established in us by God Almighty because if we want to go to the Kingdom of God, then in our freedom we must desire to get to God. If someone tries to pressurize us and says, 'You must ask for God,' then it is of no use, it is not an evaluation. That is why to reach in this state, a person has to seek the God as per his own independent sweet will and not due to any pressure, or any disease or any hardships or any sorrow, but only because of the fact and realizing that, 'It is the only motive of our life to seek God.'<br />

Apart from this there was a unique Incarnation of the Primordial Master, Ādi Guru, in the Void or Bhavasāgara. He incarnated many a times to guide humanity to cross the Void.<br />
These Masters evolved new personalities endowed with the Principles of Disciples or Śhiṣhya Tattwa, who manifested as Great Disciples of this Ādi Guru. The disciples created by Ādi Guru were human beings but they achieved salvation with the help of their Gurus or their own efforts. They were not Divine Incarnations and are known as Avadhūts.<br />

The Nav Nāths knew that Kuṇḍalinī awakening is the only way you can get your Self-realization. Their attention was enlightened, and they could just put it on matter or anything and it would work.<br />

"In the same way, Sahaja Yoga is the Ocean. You cannot name it. Do not try to find its identifity ... identity with other things.<br />
If you start doing that, then your mind will start becoming that small little cup.<br />
And moreover, if you are coming from some organized religions, it's very important to understand: that organized religions make your cup even stronger, it doesn't dissolve.<br />
If it is a disorganized religion, then it's a cup of earthenware, which can dissolve into this Ocean.<br />
But if it is a solid, nice porcelain [soft laughter], Meissen, then there is no possibility. Then you are adhering to all that conditioning, all that solidness, and then it's very difficult. <font color="red">All the time you have to bring in Christ, or you have to bring in Muhammad, or you have to bring in Zoroaster, or someone like that, who should be there to guide you.</font><br />

And at the time of Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, He very clearly talked about it. That was the tradition of evolution described in all these great Scriptures.<br />

"In every religion there is some sort of a stupid stuff pushed forward, in every. Nobody could really stop it. Because those people who are in charge of religion have no enlightenment, they have nothing to k... do with it, anywhere.<br />
And that's how, I have seen, people, say, in Japan, they follow one religion, and in uh-uh-uh China they follow another religion, both are just the same: one is Zen, another is Tao.

Muhammad Sāhab described all of Them: from Abraham to Moses, to Christ, to the Mother of Christ. And He said, :There have been more than one lākh Nabīs on this Earth."<br />

In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates. He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā).

"The material energy of sound becomes absolutely divine only when a realized Soul creates it by percussion or by vocal means. For example, chanting mantras or talking to Deities by non-realized souls creates barriers for their communication with these Deities, who become very angry with such unauthorized practices. Human beings must understand that there is a protocol for approaching the Divine; ignorance of it is no excuse. For example, if a non-realized soul continues to chant the name of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, he may get throat problems, and ultimately even throat cancer. Sounds that are used for invoking Deities in temples, or in the worship of God by realized Souls or Yogis, are the sounds which carry or reflect Divine Vibrations. Mantras are divine sounds, and the poetic language of the Scriptures is based on the complete divine expression of the sound element. The Lord's Prayer and <i>Namāz</i> are pure mantras. <font color="red">The Parsi <i>Avestha</i> Scriptures (of the followers of Zoroaster) and the Sanskrit <i>śhlokas</i> of the Hindus are all divine words which carry Divine Vibrations.</font> If these words are uttered by non-realized people, they have no meaning and give no connection to God. If they are uttered by unholy people, these can fall victims to the anger of the Deities. Such individuals may fall into the subconscious or supraconscious realms. The Divine Power, the integrated energy, is expressed as the Word, also known as the Auṃ or Logos or <i>Anahalk</i>."<br />

"In Japan we had another great Master whose name was Viditama. He was the disciple of Lord Buddha and he went to Japan and started the Zen system. Zen means meditation -- dhyāna -- and he wanted people to become "thoughtlessly aware". He found out many ways of making people "thoughtlessly aware" -- the tea ceremony and the temples that they have, are all meant to create thoughtless awareness. I was amazed that none of the Japanese knew what the purpose of these gardens were. There is one garden which has some moss on top of a hill in a very small area and it is very interesting. You have to see the flowers and other foliage there through a magnifying glass. All this should amaze a person and one should become thoughtlessly aware. That was the idea of Zen, but surprisingly, few understood Zen. <font color="red">Then there was a Prophet, Zoroaster, who was born five times in His country, Persia.</font> Ultimately Muhammad Sāhib had to come to say something very clearly about religion. <font color="red">But the people who followed Muhammad Sāhib, never realized the oneness of His preaching or that of Zoroaster, and they made all the Persians run away to all the other countries and so many of them came to India.</font><br />
Muhammad Sāhib has talked about Abraham, Moses, Christ in a series as They came one after the other. He has talked about the Mother of Christ especially with great respect. In the Bible She is not given so much respect because of Paul who edited the Bible. She is just called "the woman". But Prophet Muhammad says that anyone who talks against this Holy Lady will be punished, or something to that effect. So one can see that Muhammad Sāhib never talked of an exclusive religion called "Islam" (i.e., I surrender to God Almighty). But so many followers of Islam are fighting the followers of other religions and even amongst themselves."<br />

"The Primordial Master was also born as Macchindranāth, and again as Zoroaster who was worshiped by the ancient Persians, and still revered by Parsis. Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism. <font color="red">In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates.</font> He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā). Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918. Altogether there were ten major Avatāras of Dattātreya."<br />

"The Brahmachaitanya (All-pervading Power) has Itself become very active as a new type of age called "Kṛita Yuga" has started. It is achieving results and producing miracles. It is not only talk or reading Scriptures, but it is actualization and the proof. Of course, all false people are afraid of facing the Truth, because Sahaja Yoga goes against their interests. They are challenging and opposing violently the spread of Sahaja Yoga. The Satya Yuga has to be established by the Sahaja Yogis. <font color="red">Now they are not alone like Christ our Lord, Muhammad the Prophet, Socrates the Philosopher or other Incarnations, Seers and realized Souls.</font> They are in thousands. They are not in any way hampered by the few people who are trying to harm their collective progress. The Truth will be established and thus the dawn of Satya Yuga (the Kingdom of God) would be seen on the horizon. The message of Sahaja Yoga is that even these negative people have to accept the Truth and enjoy the blessings of the Divine Love."<br />

"<font color="red">A benevolent ruler, in the form of a philosopher king (as put forward by Socrates), is the ideal person to be the head of government.</font> Such a person must be an extremely wise, detached personality, without any desires for lust, power and money. There have been such persons in the recent past, people like Mahātmā Gāndhī, Atatürk Kemal Pasha, Anwar el-Sadat, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Ho Chi Minh, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, Dag Hammarksjöld, and Mujibur Rahman.<br />
......<br />
<font color="red">The Socratic ideal of serving the benevolence of the people, does not exist any more. On the contrary, they criticize it by insisting that Socrates was not a practical man. All the great Saints and Prophets were, of course, idealists and not practical people.</font> Most of the democracies of today's world are under the thumb of people who have no honorable or moral ideas whatsoever. They discover very fast that power can give them prosperity and that this money power can whitewash and obliterate all their misdeeds and conceal the dubious business they are up to. Unfortunately for them, this false license has now gone into their heads, like a fixed idea, and they go on behaving immorally, without any fear of the Divine, ruthlessly destroying the entire value system of democracy. They may carry on for years, as they did in Italy, until, by the Law of Polarity or by Divine Retribution, they are exposed. But before this happens, such rulers unfortunately become models for the people whom they govern and gradually moral degradation in day-to-day life begins to create a decadent or dying democratic society."<br />

"To make the people cross the Void (Bhavasāgara) He has to make some arrangement. So the Great Power like Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, Maheśha was created and They were placed in the Area of Dharma.<br />
Dattātreya and Ādi Gurus incarnated in this world many a times. He incarnated as King Janaka who was like the father of Ādi Śhakti. After that He incarnated in Iran as Zoroaster, then as Macchindranāth, then as Muhammad Sāheb and Nāṇak Sāheb.<br />
No one fought with each other. See what type of darkness you are in?<br />
Fāṭimah, the daughter of Muhammad Sāheb was the same who became daughter of King Janaka.<br />
Whom are you fighting? Think over it.<br />
The Nāṇakī of Guru Nāṇaka was none else but Jānakī.<br />
<font color="red">Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth was also an Ādi Guru.</font><br />
<font color="red">They are the Masters of all.<br />
Also, They are My Gurus. These Ādi Gurus taught Me all this Knowledge. In different Incarnations They kept Me teaching.<br /> 
Ultimately I had to come and do His work. They could not do it and now They are placing Me as a Guru so that I take up the job of a Guru.<br />
There was an age when no one was willing to accept a woman as a Guru but in Kali Yuga only Mother could do His work: it is beyond the power of men.</font><br />
This work could not be done by force, only the love of a Mother could do it because already there is so much pressure, tension in this world. The day it is forced upon the human being they will break down. So, love is the only way out.<br />
So this Gurudom was given to Me. Everything is acceptable to Me.<br />
But I didn't know the qualities of a Guru.<br />
Gurus maintain distance but mother does not keep distance with the children. Children sit on her head.<br />
So, you people also could take liberty with Me and enjoy. Be with Me with full freedom, you will neither be afraid nor be embarrassed. There is no problem, you could come and talk to Me boldly about your problems. You could complain to Me as you do to your mother. I am freely available to you.<br />
Freedom was needed, religion was required to be discussed openly, there is no secret, no secret about it. Ultimately everything has to be explained very clearly. All the secrets are to be told about, everything could not be said everywhere."<br />

"The same Śhrī Dattā incarnated many a times on the Earth.<br />
As I told you yesterday, King Janaka was one of Them. King Janaka was the father of Jānakī [Śhrī Sītā]. He was none other than the Incarnation of Śhrī Dattātreya.<br />
Thereafter, Macchindranāth, most have you must have heard His name, was also His Incarnation.<br />
After that Zoroaster who came three times on the Earth, He was also His Incarnation.<br />
After that Muhammad Sāhab, who was His Incarnation.<br />
And when He was asked that, "Bhāī [Brother], there must have been others also before You," then He replied, "Yes, there [was] a Muhammad." Then again He was asked who was before Him. He replied, "There was one Muhammad."<br />
Muhammad means Praise, the One who is praised, the One who deserves to be praised and is the One who is Redeemer of the world.<br /> 
They were all Muhammads, They were all Dattātreyas, who came on Earth regularly.<br />
After that [was] Nāṇaka, Guru Nāṇaka. If you ever read His teachings, if you read His talks then you will be surprised that He has always talked in a Sahaja. He has said, "Sahaja Samādhi lago." He has said, "Kāhe re ban khojan jāe, Sarab nivāsī sadā alepā tohī saṃg[a] samāī, Puṣhpamadhya jo bāsa basata hai mukara māhī jaise chhāī, Taise hī harī base niraṃtara ghaṭa hī khojo bhāī." ["Why to go to forest to find Him, He is always there with you just like there is a fragrance in a flower and just as the reflection is there in a mirror, in the same way God is residing in you eternally, seek Him within."] He is just inside, achieve Him just inside. We are just singing poem, singing songs, we are just cramming His prescription.<br />
The talk of seeking this Absolute Principle, residing just inside the heart, has been made since ancient times by these Ādi Gurus, who are incarnated on this Earth again and again.<br />

"Despite the wealth, property, prosperity, power or position you have, you might [be] kings and queens but you won't get joy unless you stand in the Kingdom of Joy. When you stand in the Kingdom of Joy, then in any case you become kings and queens. No one can purchase you or conquer you. You conquer everything. You become kings.<br />
<font color="red">Such great kings have come and gone in this country. In this Maharashtra, a great personage took birth who lived in a small village in Śhirḍī. People never understood His kingship, in what enjoyment He used to live. In this India, there was another king in Guru Nāṇak. Another was Kabīr. Did They enjoy any royal comforts? Today, the whole world lies at Their Feet.</font><br />
I am present before you today only to bring fulfillment to all Their teachings and Their work. Nothing They said was false. What Jesus said, what Kṛiṣhṇa said, what is written in the Gītā, what is written in the Bible, what is written in the Qur'ān will be proved by Me.<br />

"Another thing is, here in Bhavasāgar, all Three, Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, Maheśhwar, combined to make a child, who is called Ādi Guru, is known as Dattātreya. There were many Incarnations of Him. And His Child Tattwa also took Incarnations. First was Dattātreya, then came Rāja Janak. <font color="red">Like this, many Incarnations came, Rāja Janak, Nāṇak, Zarathustra, Muhammad Sāhab, Sāī Nāth of Śhirḍī.<br />
They are all one. Are They or not?</font> You can witness it after Self-realization. If you believe in one Guru, like Nāṇak, then you have no right not to accept Muhammad Sāhab. If you get Muhammad Sāhab and not Nāṇak, then you have no authority as well.<br />
You will be surprised, most of the cancer disease comes from the imbalance of Bhavasāgar, you follow one but not the other. Cancer also comes when we don't follow Them.<br />
Like He forbade two things, like not to smoke a cigarette and not to consume alcohol.<br />
Alcohol is entirely not allowed. Here, in Sahaja Yoga, if someone is habituated to drink alcohol, they will leave it. If they don't leave alcohol, it will [not] be in moderation because both of these things go against Guru Tattwa.<br />
If Guru Tattwa is not established within us, we cannot have our evolution. Guru Tattwa is essential. Guru Tattwa is one destiny for all religions. There is one flow from all the religions."<br />

"In Maharashtra, some Great Gurus have taken birth, which means we are some special people, that's what I have to say. Land of Maharashtra has something extraordinary. Or you can say that because of that soil, lotus bloomed. Those Gurus were very great.<br />
<font color="red">Before some years back we had Great Guru of Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth. No doubt about it, He was an Incarnation of Śhrī Dattātreya. There is no doubt about His Incarnation. He was a Muslim. You recognized Him, that is important.</font><br />
But there now you have built temples, big priests have come there. How they would do Pūjā for Him or worship Him? What authority they have? Who are they? And in front of them you put the money. Means, what is going on? <font color="red">What He taught, what He said?</font><br />
<font color="red">Only going to temple and sitting there, you will say, 'Sāī Bābā [of Śhirḍī] has fulfilled our wishes,' means He has done our work. He does that because He is very kind. Once you surrender to Him, He will do your work. But what you have done for Him?<br />
He is angry because you are taking His name. I have seen so many of His devotees. I have to tell Him, 'Forgive them, they don't know.' We are not qualified to take His name.<br />
He is very great, for Me.</font><br />
I am OK if you have taken My name for so many times, there is no problem. I will not get angry, I am your Mother.<br />
<font color="red">But for Him, to take His name, or to see Him with big eyes, is a big thing.</font><br />
These kinds of Great Saints we had.<br />
When they were alive, then they were tortured, that you have to accept.<br />
Now they are not here. Whatever happened it happened.<br />
But now also, how you are behaving‽ Are we behaving as per them?<br />
In Maharashtra so many Saints were there.<br />
There is one group, Śhiva Senā [Party] is created [on 1966-0619]. Some others are also created. This kind of dirty things we are doing now.<br />
<font color="red">I want to say it means what it's not a political thing, but to envy someone or think bad about others or seeing someone less than you or big than you, etc., these things should not happen by [to] devotees of Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth. Let other people do that.<br />
Keeping Sāī's Photo at home and say[ing] that, 'Hindus, Muslims are different'! That kind of thing you can't spread. Admitted that Muslims are bad that they have done something wrong or harassed someone, admitted Hindus are bad [that] they have harassed someone! But when you are keeping His Photo, where you stand? You are at His Feet.</font><br />
But if you are a disciple of anyone, fine.<br />

I meam, He was so much uh-uh-uh ... full of love for people that once there was in a woman who was very poor and she couldn't celebrate her uh Diwālī Day and He couldn't bear it.

And with this power, you can increase food, sort of thing, you see. You increase the food stuff, you are going to some, like Christ did it, you see. That's also [using] one [left] side.<br />
So these, all these things come in a personality: uh-uh-uh some people have one more, another has some more, and some people have all these qualities. <br />

"I have told you about Nābhī chakra and also about Void. The Guru Principle resides in this Bhavasāgara [Void] and this Guru Principle establishes the dharma within us. These ten petals here that we have shown are the ones which establishes the Ten Dharmas within us.<br />
It is important to have these Ten Dharmas in a human being otherwise he is not a human being. Even if he has has nine dharmas in him is still [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] a bit and if he does not follow these dharmas that are within him, and when I say dharma I don't mean by Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and all that, but dharma means the Innate Dharma of humanity within, if one does not keep to those Ten Dharmas, then he turns into a demon [devil].<br />
<font color="red">This Guru Principle (Tattwa) has taken birth in this world in many forms especially it has these Ten Main Incarnations have taken birth like Rāja Janaka, Nāṇak, Muhammad Sāhab, etc. and at the end it was Sāī Nāth from Śhirḍī, who took birth. They tie this Tattwa [Principle] within us because all these Gurus who have taken birth for our evolution are placed within us.</font><br /> 
[<font color="orange">unclear</font>] these Gurus are very subtly placed Deities within us.<br />
Like for these Guru already say, "Don't consume alcohol," then They weren't mad that They said this. Neither They were standing in any elections to win votes that They said that. You can't even say that They had any kind of business that in some competitive feeling He said that thing.<br />
They said, "Child, don't drink alcohol, don't take to cigarettes, don't take any kind of drugs," because the position of our attention within is also placed in the area of Void.<br />
You will be surprised to know that our attention is in our stomach. Actually, to be specific, in liver resides our attention.<br />
They said, "You don't drink alcohol," so your attention does not get spoiled. You know by drinking human awareness gets damaged.<br />
People got the other way by saying, 'OK, if drinking is not allowed then let's not garlic, onions, etc.' Prophet Muhammad used to eat garlic, onions and also Nāṇaka used to eat meat and all that."<br />

"It is surprising that there is a gentleman in Rangoon who is an Avadhūta. Not only in India, but they can be found all around the world. Prophet Muhammad was an Avadhūta. King Janaka was an Avadhūta, so was Nāṇak.<br />
Many of them [Avadhūtas] did a lot of work in this Maharashtra. It is only because of their work here did I take My birth in this place.<br />
<font color="red">Sāī Nāth was the last of them from Maharashtra.</font><br />
Their work establishes the dharma. Or more like the dharma settles down in that place. They take their form on this earth only to fulfill that goal.<br />
When the human loses his faith in dharma, 'Why should I do this?', when he starts thinking this ways, then the Avadhūtas take birth on this Earth. And wherever they may be, in forests or mountains, dead or alive, all they do is keep working on giving you the validations of dharma.<br />
If you tell lies and start suffering from its consequences, then realize that there is some Avadhūta, sitting on some mountain in the Himalayas, who is responsible for whatever is happening to you. He is the one putting you all right.<br />
......<br />
But the concepts of dharma, as this world knows it today, are so complicated and twisted, "I don't drink, I don't even consume garlic." "Is it so? OK, you don't drink, you don't eat garlic, onions, etc., you don't do anything, granted. Then why is your Void catching?" Void meaning where Dattā [Śhrī Dattātreya] resides, in the stomach. "But I am a huge opponent of Muslims." That's it: you have lost your quality of Avadhūta. The Avadhūtas have been offended.<br />
<font color="red">These entities, say Muhammad, or Janaka, or Sāī Nāth, do you think any of these belong to any religion, caste or creed?<br />
Say, we keep a Photograph of Sāī Nāth in our home, who was He? Wasn't He a Muslim? Be truthful.</font><br /> 
So if someone becomes a Muslim, he turns bad, how did you form this conclusion? Who was Kabīr Dās? Who was Nāṇak?"<br />

<b>Version 1:</b><br />
"We are all very thankful to the citizens of Ahmednagar for inviting us so lovingly.<br />
Moreover, Ahmednagar district feels special to Me. This is because work that started in Rāhūrī and spread across makes one realize that there is something especially religious that has happened in this district before.<br />
As is, Maharashtra is a very spiritual environment. Because of that, many Saints have been born here and they have worked here.<br />
<font color="red">At the very end if we recall, Sāī Nāth as you know has done beautiful work in Ahmednagar district.</font><br />
......<br />
Now, living by the dharma doesn't mean making rounds of the temple and reciting the name of God a thousand.<br />
The meaning of dharma has been told by a number of Saints in this country. In this Land of Saints, a number of Gurus have come and have spoken to great lengths about what dharma is, we can't thank Them enough. But we don't follow any of what They have said.<br />
Out of all the Gurus, there have been Ten Important Ones and They have come in this world multiple times. The Prophet Muhammad is an incarnation of Dattātreya. After Muhammad Sāhib, Nāṇak who came on this Earth was an incarnation of Dattātreya too, so was Janak. Likewise Ādināth, who came before Māhavīr, was also an incarnation of Dattātreya. <font color="red">Furthermore, the people of this Ahmednagar are extremely fortunate in the sense that Śhirḍī [84 kms NNW from Ahmadnagar] was the place where Śhrī Sāī Nāth chose to come and stay. He too was an incarnation of Dattātreya.</font> So, it is the same element of the Guru, which keeps reincarnating on this Earth.<br />
They focused on teaching about things pertaining to maintaining the balance of the dharma, They didn't talk much about Self-realization as such, didn't work upon giving knowledge about the Ātmā to people.<br />
The one thing that all of Them had said was to not consume alcohol.<br />
......<br />
And such false people have always been the ones to trouble the Saints. You know, how badly such people have caused misery to Dñyāneśhwar. <font color="red">Then, Sāī Nāth.</font> They have not spared even a single Saint.<br />
Not only that, [but] when Śhaṅkarāchārya wanted to perform the rituals after the death of His mother, these people didn't even allow Him to do those. They said He was not allowed to do them as He was a saṃnyāsī.<br />
So, likewise, such unauthorized people claiming to be higher above others have always insulted the Saints and made their lives miserable. Not only in India, but also elsewhere -- Prophet Muhammad was tortured by such people as well. He and His family were tortured so much more than Dñyāneśhwar, actually."<br /> 
<b>Version 2:</b><br />
"The people of Ahmednagar sent us an invitation with lot of affection, we are all very grateful for that.<br />
And furthermore, I feel Ahmednagar District to be very special. Because the work that began in Rāhūrī and which kept spreading, that made Me realize that there was some special religious work that took place in this District in the past.<br />
Also, Maharashtra is a spiritual region. Hence a lot of Saints have taken birth over here and have done a lot of work.<br />
<font color="red">Finally, to mention as we all know, Śhrī Sāī Nāth has done beautiful work in Ahmednagar District.</font><br />
......<br />
To live with dharma does not mean parroting the name of God in the temples.<br />
The meaning of being religious has been explained by a number of Saints in this country. In this land of Saints, a number of Gurus have come and have spoken to great lengths about what dharma is, we can't thank Them enough. But we don't follow any of what They have said.<br />
Out of all the gurus, there have been Ten Important Ones and They have come in this world multiple times. Of these the Prophet Muhammad is an Incarnation of Dattātreya. After Muhammad Sāhib, Nāṇak who came on this earth was an Incarnation of Dattātreya too, so was Janak. Likewise Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], who came before Mahāvīr, was also an Incarnation of Dattātreya. <font color="red">After this we were really lucky, specially people from Ahmadnagar, that Sāī Nāth who stayed in Śhirḍī [84 kms NNW from Ahmadnagar], He too is an Incarnation of Dattātreya.</font> So, it is the same element of the Guru, which reappears on this Earth.<br />
And They taught several things regarding the balance of dharma. They didn't talk much about giving Realization as such. They did not work too much on giving knowledge on Self-enlightenment to people.<br />
The one thing He said, that all of [Ten of] Them corroborate on, was not to consume alcohol.<br />
......<br />
And such spurious people, they have always tormented the Saints. You know, how badly such people have caused misery to Dñyāneśhwara. <font color="red">Then, Sāī Nāth.</font> They have not spared anyone.<br />
Not only that, when Śhaṅkarāchārya, Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya went home when his mother died and He wanted to perform the final rituals, these people told him that, "You cannot perform as you are a saṃnyāsī." And nobody turned up for the final rituals. In Kālaṭi village He cut the tree and ignited the banana tree and performed the rituals. And He cursed entire Kerala that, "You would perform the final rituals in front of your homes and bury the dead body there." Even today same thing is happening.<br />
So, likewise, such unauthorized people have insulted all the Saints and monks. Not only in our country, but in most of the countries.<br />
Even during the times of Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon Him, the unauthorized people tortured and persecuted Him immensely. If we describe that we get to know that when compared to Muhammad Sāhib and family, even Dñyāneśhwara was not tortured so much. They tried to destroy Them totally."<br />

"So the dharma that has been established in us by God Almighty because if we want to go to the Kingdom of God, then in our freedom we must desire to get to God. If someone tries to pressurize us and says, 'You must ask for God,' then it is of no use, it is not an evaluation. That is why to reach in this state, a person has to seek the God as per his own independent sweet will and not due to any pressure, or any disease or any hardships or any sorrow, but only because of the fact and realizing that, 'It is the only motive of our life to seek God.'<br />
<font color="red">That is why, when we desire for this Divine Gift, then the doors of God Almighty's Divine Blessings open for you, and around the center is a place of Ten Primordial Gurus. These are the Main Gurus which are the Incarnation[s] of Śhri Dattātreya. They are: Socrates, Moses, Muhammad Sāhab, Guru Nāṇak, Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth, and Zoroaster. They are all Incarnation[s] of one Incarnation.</font>"<br />

"About Me also you can ask questions. There are many ways of recognizing because in this life, you have to recognize. You have never recognized an Incarnation so far. You have to recognize.<br />
That is compulsory and that is done through Sahajs Yoga because unless and until you are realized, how are going to recognize Them also?<br />
But even if you have not recognized Them, there was no need for you to crucify Them or to torture.<br />
Then all the Gurus who came on this Earth, the Real Ones -- fakes are never gurus, they are not gurus -- the Real Ones that came on this Earth, say, we can say Moses, Abraham, Nāṇak, Muhammad Sāhib, Kabīr, all these are Incarnations of Primordial Master whom we call as Dattātreya.<br />
If They are or not, if Muhammad Sāhib and Guru Nāṇak are the same personality, same people who came in different times, then what justice are we doing to Them? How are we to find out? How are you to believe Me about it?<br />
I will give you an example. There was a Muslim gentleman from Iran who came to see Me, who was suffering from cancer. He asked Me: "Mother, I want to get cured." I said, "You['re] a Muslim?", he said, "Yes, I only believe in Muhammad Sāhib and nobody else!" I said, "This would be something like that, 'I only believe in my nose, and not in anything else.' "<br />
He was such a fanatic and fanaticism brings about the cancer of Nābhī chakra as we call it, the stomach. You will be amazed fanaticism is sin, sinful. It gives you the cancer of stomach.<br />
I asked him, "Will you worship Nāṇak Sāhib?" He said, "No, why should I? I am a Muslim." I said, "Do you know Muhammad Sāhib Himself is angry with you and you have to worship Nāṇak?"<br />
He would not but it happened for months and then he had to accept.<br />
Any extreme behavior of this kind is prohibited in all the religions.<br />
<font color="red">When Nāṇak came or when even our Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth came, They talked about sadāchār.</font> Even the Goddess's name is Sadāchār Pravartakā [Founder/Source of Good Conduct].<br /> 
Sadāchār is the most important thing. The dhana [treasure] is the most important thing. One has to be in dharma. If you are adharmī, how do you expect Me to give you Realization, you just tell Me?<br />
Today I went to see a tailor of Mine who was saying, "Mother, if I am bad You tell me but why should not I get Realization?" I said, "True, why should not you? All right ask a question, 'Mother, are you Nāṇak?' " He asked Me the question. Normally the vibrations start but would not. He said, "What has happened to me?" I said, "See where is your Surati?"<br />
Nāṇak has described Kuṇḍalinī as Surati.<br />
His Kuṇḍalinī was pulsating at Nābhī. You could see with your naked eye. His friend or his proprietor was also seeing that. It was pulsating there.<br /> 
I said, "You have a liver. Do you drink?" He said, "I drink quite a lot." Then I said, "How do you expect Me to give you Realization in the name of Nāṇak who has prohibited all this?"<br />
When I say this people brand Me as anything."<br />

"So, if you think evolution is a religion, then I would say Sahaja Yoga is the religion. If your evolution if you call it as a religion, then Sahaja Yoga is a religion. But is a religion which takes you belo ... beyond your sustenance, beyond your religion, dharmātīt, beyond the dharma.<br />
We have amongst ourselves Hindu[s], Muslims, Christians, all kinds of people, you know that. All these people can feel it within themselves: is the religion in their stomachs, they can feel it. They can find out where is the religion. Because, I say, there, religion in the stomach is looked after by the Deities of Primordial Master whom we call as Dattātreya, in the Sanskrit language.<br />
But does't mean Hinduism. It doesn't mean Hinduism at all. But it is called as Dattātreya in the Sanskrit language, in English is Primordial Master.<br />
<font color="red">He is the same who incarnated on this earth: as Moses, as Abraham, and, say, incarnated as Muhammad Sāhab, as Rāja Janaka, as Nāṇaka, and also as Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth.</font> Can you believe that Muhammad Sāhab is the same as our Nāṇak?"<br />

"But still, as you can see in the life of Christ, that coming of Christ was declared much before Christ came in by the Prophets who made prophecies. All these Prophets belong to the category of the Gurus I am talking about.<br />
So, all over the world three types of movements were on. For example, the scientist[s] on the right-hand side, we can say, and the left-hand side are the devotees of God who sing the praise of God. And in the center there were people like Moses, like Abraham, who came on this earth just to prophesize, just to protect the devotees of God.<br />
Now this middle movement of evolution, today, has reached its peak. Because all the Incarnations have arrived now, and have done Their job within you. They have occupied Their position within you, in your awareness, on these different centers. <br />
......<br />
So today we are here to know that within us all these Incarnations exist, and the force that really brought forth, really manifested, who live like human beings and work like Gurus, that force which existed in this area, which created religion within us.<br />
Religion, as we understand, organized religion, is not the religion. But the religion means: your sustaining power. You are a human being because there are ten sustaining powers within you.<br />
So, They came to sustain us and to give us full idea about these Ten Powers and to establish us in our religion as a human being.<br />
So these Gurus, who lived in that area, worked out the sustainace [sustenance] and helped us.<br />
And this is one of the greatest forces we have got, which resides within us.<br />
And whatever They have said has a very great meaning.<br />
Actually, we should say the Main Gurus are ten, but there are many other Gurus.<br />
<font color="red">And these Ten Gurus could be described as Rāja Janaka, then Moses, Abraham, and the in modern times you can say Muhammad Sāhab, and even up to Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth, in Śhirḍī, that force came in, for a short time, and then He disappeared. Nobody knows how He came there, He lived there and He died.</font> Also, if you know Nāṇaka, He was also the same force, the same Primordial Master, who was born on this Earth.<br />
Now, this is not the time to tell about individual people. But, I think, one day I will talk to you only on this subject of the Gurus.<br />
So, these Gurus first started under the Primordial Master Himself, He was called as Dattātreya.
......<br />
There's one more point I would like to tell you, that they have not yet gone here, but here [], there are the two uh more small uh-uh-uh chakras: one that belongs to, uh uh which we call as the Sūrya -- Sūrya is the-uh-uh uh uh, means the Sun, the Sun center -- and the another as the Moon center on the left-hand side. And these two are uh governed or, we can say, is uh bestowed upon by two great uh-uh-uh people, who are the Disciple Elements.<br />
And They, disciple elements were first, were born to Śhrī Rāma and Śhrī Sītā as the-ee Lav and Kuśh. And then They incarnated many a times on this Earth as disciple. One of Them is, we can say, ah ... was uh Śhaṅkarāchārya, another was Kabīra, uh like that. Then, we can say, later on, uh like, uh before Śhaṅkarāchārya, they came as Buddha and Mahāvīra. Then Śhaṅkarāchārya, and then, uh I told you, which is? Uh after Śhaṅkarāchārya came ... the Advent of Hasan and Husayn, who were the grandsons of Prophet.<br />
So these have been incarnating, and they have been moving from one uh-uh-uh side to another and telling people that, "This is extreme, leave it." "This is the extreme, leave it. Come in the center, and be in the center." That has been Their job. And they are the ones who are, sort of, imparting you that awareness by you become a perfect disciple.<br />
And the ... this is a very important point because it comes, quite often, that uh-uh-uh we do not understand.<br /> 
Like Prophet Muhammad said that: "I am the last Prophet." All right, He did say He was the last Prophet.<br />
Supposing I say, I am the last person to come here. All right I would say just to frighten you that, 'h-oh, you better take to it otherwise this is the last time I am telling you!' [Laughs.]<br />
But it is never that!<br />
Because when He wa... died He found out: that, you see, these people are madcaps. 'I didn't tell them this, what are they doing out of Me?' So, He said, 'I better go back again.'<br />
And He came as Nāṇaka. And He told them, that: "Hindu and Muslims are same people, following the same religion, why are you fighting among yourselves?" See, They came for that unity.<br />
Then as Nāṇaka He came. So, in Nāṇaka's system also the Sikhism came in and they started a warrior class and this and that. I mean imagine, the Sikhism ended up by having wars within Muslims and Hindus.<br />
<font color="red">So, then He came as Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth to teach them.</font><br />
Now, this is not a very important thing that, say Muhammad Sāhab said, "I am the last." Say He is the last, all right, even take that position. Who are you to Him? How are you related? Through what? What is your authority? How do you appropriate Him to yourself? Because you say you are Muslims, so what? How did you become Muslims? Did you get your certificate from God?"<br />

"When Śhrī Rām came, people said that they accepted Paraśhurām, when Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa came they said, they accepted Śhrī Rām, and at the time of Śhrī Nāṇaka, they accepted Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. When Christ was here they accepted Abraham.<br />
All of Them had taken human form. But it is all the play of buddhi: how interesting it is!<br />
<font color="red">Now, I have come and people are accepting Śhrī Sāī Nāth.<br />
But when He lived here, He did not even get anything to eat. Why was it so? He was also a human being. As long as He was alive, He too was considered useless and tortured. But when He died, He was regarded as Bhagavān.</font><br />
What is the reason of this all? Why has man been like this?<br />
You will have water of the Ganges, where She flows. If She is flowing here, will you say, 'We do not accept Her as the Ganges!'? There may be nothing at the place where She was flowing earlier, or maybe only a nullah [ravine] at present. If you want to take it as the Ganges, you go your way. If the Ganges is flowing at this place, why not accept it?<br />
It is not easy to understand human intellect. It is the most difficult job in the world! It is easy to understand God, because He is what He is. He does not have such double dealings. Man has a variety of qualities, not just double. All animals from snakes and scorpions to elephants, horses and lions are residing in him. You will not understand at all, why his brain is working in this way.<br />
Now when the Ganges is flowing why don't you take water from Her?<br />
Imagine this plug has been connected here. Will you connect in its place a plug which is out of order? It is quite pragmatic.<br />
I cannot understand what hallucination is there on human intellect, that he does not accept the Truth which he is seeing but accepts something that is not seen?
Its reason was understood long back and that is ahaṅkār [ego]. Man has too much of ego.<br />
If you had accepted Śhrī Rāma in His days, He would have told you to get your Kuṇḍalinī awakened and get the Realization and get established in Sahaja Yoga.<br />
Had you recognized Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, He would not have played Sahaja Yoga in Gokul, but would have given you the Realization and told you to practice Sahaja Yoga.<br />
If Śhrī Nāṇak had been accepted, there was no need for Him to break His head telling you to do different things. He would have simply taught Sahaja Yoga, but very few understood Him in His days.<br />
Now, when He is not here, you have built gurudwārās in His name.<br />
When Muhammad is not here mosques have been made, because they think now Muhammad Sāhib is in their hands.<br />
Now Rāma is in their hands, and they can make His temple and say, 'His is our temple, this Rāma is our property. We have authority over Him and whatever you have brought, all money and other things, offer them to this idol.'<br />
You say all this because you think you are the authority of this idol. It is sheer ego because of which man thinks, that he can keep God in his control and for that he is making all the show. Every time the same show was repeated."<br />

"Now, through Sahaja Yoga you will come to know about the problems. How to balance its integrity? How to awaken Ādi Guru Dattātreya within?<br />
Once Dattātreya is awakened within you, then the religion will spontaneously gets awakened. Then it becomes very difficult to do adharma.<br />
The most important thing is that all these Gurus said that, "You should know it."<br />
First thing is that human being should not be addicted to any drug or intoxicant.<br />
<font color="red">They say that Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth used to smoke. He was different.</font><br />

"But there is a group of people, still, who have been realized, and who are not, yet, there. Now what is the difference between the two is? In very simple: is the recognition. Those who have not recognized Me, will not be blessed. They'll be going round and round and round. So, it is necessary to recognize.<br />
<font color="red">Now there are some people, like, we ... I'll say, very good example is, Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth's disciples are there. Now He is no more. So they believe in Him. Now where is He?</font><br />
They don't want to believe in the present Incarnation! They want to believe in something that is dead. They believe in Rāma. They'll believe in Christ. Most of the Christians have this problem.<br />

Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism. In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates. He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya).

<font color="red">"You know, King Janaka was called as Videha. The great Sage Nārada asked Him one day, "Revered Sir, how are you called as Videha? You live in this world, how can you be a Videha?" Rāja Janaka said, "This is very simple. I will tell you about it in the evening. Now, please do this little job for Me. There is milk in this bowl. You take this bowl and come along with Me. Please see that not a single drop of milk is spilled on the earth. Then only will I tell you why I am called Videha."<br />
Nārada took the bowl and followed Janaka everywhere. He had to be very careful because the bowl was such that by the slightest movement the milk might have spilled. He got quite tired.<br />
When they retired for the evening Nārada asked, "Please tell me now. I am getting quite fed up with carrying this bowl of milk and following You everywhere at the same time." Rāja Janaka said, "First of all, tell Me what you have seen?" Nārada replied, "Nothing except this bowl of milk so that it won't spill." Rāja Janaka said, "Didn't you see that there was a big procession in My honor? Then there was a court wherein there was a program of dancing? Didn't you see anything?" Nārada answered, "No, Sir. I have not seen anything." Rāja Janaka said, "My child, likewise with Me. I also see nothing. All the time I just watch My attention, where it is going, making sure it won't spill away like the milk." "</font><br />

"To make the people cross the Void (Bhavasāgara) He has to make some arrangement. So the Great Power like Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, Maheśha was created and They were placed in the Area of Dharma.<br />

Also, They are My Gurus. These Ādi Gurus taught Me all this Knowledge. In different Incarnations They kept Me teaching.<br /> 
Ultimately I had to come and do His work. They could not do it and now They are placing Me as a Guru so that I take up the job of a Guru.<br />
There was an age when no one was willing to accept a woman as a Guru but in Kali Yuga only Mother could do His work: it is beyond the power of men.</font><br />
This work could not be done by force, only the love of a Mother could do it because already there is so much pressure, tension in this world. The day it is forced upon the human being they will break down. So, love is the only way out.<br />
So this Gurudom was given to Me. Everything is acceptable to Me.<br />
But I didn't know the qualities of a Guru.<br />
Gurus maintain distance but mother does not keep distance with the children. Children sit on her head.<br />
So, you people also could take liberty with Me and enjoy. Be with Me with full freedom, you will neither be afraid nor be embarrassed. There is no problem, you could come and talk to Me boldly about your problems. You could complain to Me as you do to your mother. I am freely available to you.<br />
Freedom was needed, religion was required to be discussed openly, there is no secret, no secret about it. Ultimately everything has to be explained very clearly. All the secrets are to be told about, everything could not be said everywhere."<br />

"But before reaching the Heart chakra, the gap I showed you, is all the Bhavasāgara. In the center is the seat of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, and on it Śhrī Brahmadeva creates the whole universe. He made this Bhavasāgara.<br />
After creating the Bhavasāgara, the question was, 'How to cross it over? The human being was created, but how to make him realize it? How to make human beings recognize it? In him, how to activate the Brahma Tattwa?' Meaning, 'How to get the Union of Śhiva and Śhakti within him? How would the connection be established?'<br />
For this, a special personality was created in this world. This was created by the combined essence of Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, and Maheśh, who we acknowledge as Śhrī Dattātreya. Śhrī Dattātreya is none other than Ādi Guru.<br />
He is My Guru. He has mentored Me all His past lives.<br />
If you hear about His birth and all His previous lives you would be amazed. We have forgotten such a great thing.<br />
Śhrī Dattātreya's Incarnations are numerous. <font color="red">Firstly He came as King Janaka. Śhrī Sītājī was His daughter, who was the embodiment of Śhakti Herself.</font> Then He came as Macchindranāth, Zoroaster, and Muhammad Sāhab, who were a completely different type of human being.<br />
They trialed out lots of different things.<br /> 
Śhrī Datta, the Primordial Masters firstly in this world educated us about the symbolic forms within us. And then also said that, "You people got entangled in symbolism, in idol worshiping." Their meaning was to go beyond and recognize the Śhakti within these idols. That's why They talked about the idols.<br />
<font color="red">For example, there is a flower, and to describe the honey within the flower, They talked about the flower first, from which the people would taste the honey. But people got stuck to flower. So Then they took Incarnations and talked about the honey.<br />
In that, They talked about God in the abstract. They deliberately didn't talk about the reincarnation of life.</font><br />
Because as soon as you talk about past lives, people ask Me, "Mātājī, tell me about my past lives." The life that has passed, why do you want to know that? Whether you were a king or a pauper, what difference it will make?<br />
<font color="red">That's why They did not discuss past lives.<br />
Muhammad Sāhab was the same, Dattātreya's Incarnation, and the same Incarnation was King Janaka.</font> The same Incarnation was Nāṇaka, whose sister Nāṇakī, was the same Ādi Śhakti. She was Sītājī."<br />

"The same Śhrī Dattā incarnated many a times on the Earth.<br />
<font color="red">As I told you yesterday, King Janaka was one of Them. King Janaka was the father of Jānakī [Śhrī Sītā]. He was none other than the Incarnation of Śhrī Dattātreya.</font><br />
Thereafter, Macchindranāth, most have you must have heard His name, was also His Incarnation.<br />
After that Zoroaster who came three times on the Earth, He was also His Incarnation.<br />
......<br /> 
<font color="red">They were all Muhammads, They were all Dattātreyas, who came on Earth regularly.</font><br />
......<br />
<font color="red">The talk of seeking this Absolute Principle, residing just inside the heart, has been made since ancient times by these Ādi Gurus, who are incarnated on this Earth again and again.</font><br />
......<br />
<font color="red">For this reason I will give an example of King Janaka. Once a very great arch called Nachiketa went to the King Janaka. He was first suspicious and eager. He asked his guru, "Why do you pay visit to Him since He is a householder and also a king and then why do you bow down before Him and touch His Feet? He is a householder person!" Then he replied, "OK, you should go to the place of King Janaka and stay there. You know that He is called as a Videhi [Videha, incorporeal], He was a dehati [a country person]."<br />
When Nachiketa lived with Him then he saw that there was so much wealth, people were eating and living comfortably. The King enjoyed all type of meals. He roams and has children, such a Man, and how it is possible that this Man should know God?<br />
Next day he told that, "I am leaving just now, I'm just leaving now. I do not have to live here." Then King said, "OK, let's go for a bath first." They went to bath in a river. He took him to Sharayū [Sarayū] River for bath. While bathing in a river, suddenly somebody informed that, "O Lord, Your palace is on fire." King Janaka said, "Let it be, just now I'm in meditation," He replied with a smile. This poor Nachiketa got little worried. After a while people told that, "All of Your family member have to run away and fire is fast approaching You." Then He said, "To hell with it, now I'm in meditation." Afterwards they said that, "Fire has reached up to here and all Your ornaments and clothes will get burnt." All the bodyguards also ran away. This Nachiketa, whose one or two clothes were lying outside, he thought that, 'If these too were burnt, then what will happen to him [me]?' So he also ran outside. He picked up all his clothes. Even then He was in meditation.<br />
When He came back, Nachiketa was very much surprised. He asked, "King, do You have not any worry that had Your clothes been burnt then would You have moved just in this way?" Then He replied, "What is myth is going to be perished. There is no need to save it, till it is there keep it there or if it is not there then leave it."</font><br />
This is a true fact. Those gurus who do not consider myth as myth, then what are you going to find in them?"

"Many people have said this many times and if you look at all the great men of religion (dharm puruṣho), no one of Them took to saṃnyās. Except for the Nāth Pānthis. And even they had a difficult path.<br />
<font color="red">You know that Janak was a king and He lived like a king but people call Him Videhi [Videha, incorporeal]. That is why Jānakī is called Vaidehī.</font><br />
You know that Nāṇak was married and Kṛiṣhṇa also married. Rāma also married. And like you, They were family loving people of the world. None of Them took saṃnyās, etc.<br />
Neither did these people gave importance to [Haṭha] Yoga. Only Patañjali gave special importance to [Haṭha] Yoga.<br /> 
But no one reads Patañjali also. They accept any fifth or sixthhand information coming about [Haṭha] Yoga. And considering it important, and they start doing Yoga what is called as Haṭha Yoga.<br />
Haṭha Yoga is very harmful for normal people who live in a family.<br />

They are all one. Are They or not?</font> You can witness it after Self-realization. If you believe in one Guru, like Nāṇak, then you have no right not to accept Muhammad Sāhab. If you get Muhammad Sāhab and not Nāṇak, then you have no authority as well.<br />
You will be surprised, most of the cancer disease comes from the imbalance of Bhavasāgar, you follow one but not the other. Cancer also comes when we don't follow Them.<br />
Like He forbade two things, like not to smoke a cigarette and not to consume alcohol.<br />
Alcohol is entirely not allowed. Here, in Sahaja Yoga, if someone is habituated to drink alcohol, they will leave it. If they don't leave alcohol, it will [not] be in moderation because both of these things go against Guru Tattwa.<br />
If Guru Tattwa is not established within us, we cannot have our evolution. Guru Tattwa is essential. Guru Tattwa is one destiny for all religions. There is one flow from all the religions."<br />

"Now, this Guru was created when the world was created itself. Because we ... one had to create a Guru before the world was created in then Vaikuṇṭha Stage only.<br />
But then He reincarnated many a times.<br />
At the time of Rāma, very early, even before Rāma came into this world, much earlier than that, He was created by Satī Anusūyā. She was Herself a part of the Ādi Śhakti, who created Him out of the essences, the innocence of Brahmā, Viṣhṇu and Maheśh.<br />
There's a legend about it which I will tell you sometime.<br />
And She created Him. Actually, She created Him, so She's the Mother.<br />
But then, She becomes the Guru.<br />
<font color="red">When She is born as Sītā, He becomes the father. So, She ... father is Her Guru.<br />
Then, when Rāja Janaka is born as Muhammad Sāhab, then She becomes again the daughter.</font><br />
But when He is born as Nāṇaka, then He becomes the ... She becomes His sister.<br />
So the relationship exists and whenever He is born, She is born, in a way, that, you see, that relationship is kept a sublime relationship. I mean to say: that they are never born as husband and wife."<br />

"I have told you about Nābhī chakra and also about Void. The Guru Principle resides in this Bhavasāgara [Void] and this Guru Principle establishes the dharma within us. These ten petals here that we have shown are the ones which establishes the Ten Dharmas within us.<br />
It is important to have these Ten Dharmas in a human being otherwise he is not a human being. Even if he has has nine dharmas in him is still [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] a bit and if he does not follow these dharmas that are within him, and when I say dharma I don't mean by Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and all that, but dharma means the Innate Dharma of humanity within, if one does not keep to those Ten Dharmas, then he turns into a demon [devil].<br />
<font color="red">This Guru Principle (Tattwa) has taken birth in this world in many forms especially it has these Ten Main Incarnations have taken birth like Rāja Janaka, Nāṇak, Muhammad Sāhab, etc. and at the end it was Sāī Nāth from Śhirḍī, who took birth. They tie this Tattwa [Principle] within us because all these Gurus who have taken birth for our evolution are placed within us.</font><br />
[<font color="orange">unclear</font>] these Gurus are very subtly placed Deities within us.<br />
Like for these Guru already say, "Don't consume alcohol," then They weren't mad that They said this. Neither They were standing in any elections to win votes that They said that. You can't even say that They had any kind of business that in some competitive feeling He said that thing.<br />
They said, "Child, don't drink alcohol, don't take to cigarettes, don't take any kind of drugs," because the position of our attention within is also placed in the area of Void.<br />
You will be surprised to know that our attention is in our stomach. Actually, to be specific, in liver resides our attention.<br />
They said, "You don't drink alcohol," so your attention does not get spoiled. You know by drinking human awareness gets damaged.<br />
People got the other way by saying, 'OK, if drinking is not allowed then let's not garlic, onions, etc.' Prophet Muhammad used to eat garlic, onions and also Nāṇaka used to eat meat and all that.<br />
......<br />
Now in this Void we have two great entities as well which we know as Chandra [Moon] and Sūrya [Sun]. Moon and Sun are such chakras which reside on these nāḍīs here and here [likely pointing towards the Chakra Chart]. On these chakras there are two very great personalities who have been appointed. They are complete embodiment of human beings. They are like humans, in fact are humans. Out of these one is Buddha and one is Mahāvīra.<br />
But if you listen to the whole history of Their lives, then these are two sons which Śhrī Sītā had as Lav and Kuśha who is completely in human form. And after They evolved to the level that They are here as Buddha and Mahāvīra. There also they thought They have reached an extreme of nonviolence because the supports of nonviolence came in and started protecting even mosquitoes and bugs.<br />
Then They again took birth and came at the time of Muhammad. <font color="red">Muhammad was an Incarnation of Śhrī Janaka and His daughter Fāṭimah Bi was also Incarnation of Śhrī Sītā.</font><br />
Then, as Their sons as Hasan and Husayn, They gave their life in Karbalāʾ to prove that no kind of extreme is good."<br />

"Therefore those who have liver, etc. takalīph [problem, difficulty] or have the problem of diabetes because of this chakra, what I told you, due to imbalance, those who are rajoguṇīs [right-sided] people, that problems those [people] get, the treatment of all those problems is taking the name of Hazarat ʿAlī Sāhab.

"It is surprising that there is a gentleman in Rangoon who is an Avadhūta. Not only in India, but they can be found all around the world. Prophet Muhammad was an Avadhūta. <font color="red">King Janaka was an Avadhūta, so was Nāṇak.</font><br />
Many of them [Avadhūtas] did a lot of work in this Maharashtra. It is only because of their work here did I take My birth in this place.<br />
Sāī Nāth was the last of them from Maharashtra.<br />
Their work establishes the dharma. Or more like the dharma settles down in that place. They take their form on this earth only to fulfill that goal.<br />
When the human loses his faith in dharma, 'Why should I do this?', when he starts thinking this ways, then the Avadhūtas take birth on this Earth. And wherever they may be, in forests or mountains, dead or alive, all they do is keep working on giving you the validations of dharma.<br />
If you tell lies and start suffering from its consequences, then realize that there is some Avadhūta, sitting on some mountain in the Himalayas, who is responsible for whatever is happening to you. He is the one putting you all right.<br />
......<br />
<font color="red">The dharma in humans has at least ten aspects of discipline to it that should be followed, and all Gurus have emphasized that this needs to happen. They could be in the form of Muhammad, Nāṇak or Janak.</font><br />

But the concepts of dharma, as this world knows it today, are so complicated and twisted, "I don't drink, I don't even consume garlic." "Is it so? OK, you don't drink, you don't eat garlic, onions, etc., you don't do anything, granted. Then why is your Void catching?" Void meaning where Dattā [Śhrī Dattātreya] resides, in the stomach. "But I am a huge opponent of Muslims." That's it: you have lost your quality of Avadhūta. The Avadhūtas have been offended.<br />
<font color="red">These entities, say Muhammad, or Janaka, or Sāī Nāth, do you think any of these belong to any religion, caste or creed?</font><br />
Say, we keep a Photograph of Sāī Nāth in our home, who was He? Wasn't He a Muslim? Be truthful.<br />

"Now, living by the dharma doesn't mean making rounds of the temple and reciting the name of God a thousand.<br />

Out of all the Gurus, there have been Ten Important Ones and They have come in this world multiple times. The Prophet Muhammad is an incarnation of Dattātreya. <font color="red">After Muhammad Sāhib, Nāṇak who came on this Earth was an incarnation of Dattātreya too, so was Janak.</font> Likewise Ādināth, who came before Māhavīr, was also an incarnation of Dattātreya. Furthermore, the people of this Ahmednagar are extremely fortunate in the sense that Śhirḍī [84 kms NNW from Ahmadnagar] was the place where Śhrī Sāī Nāth chose to come and stay. He too was an incarnation of Dattātreya. So, it is the same element of the Guru, which keeps reincarnating on this Earth.<br />
They focused on teaching about things pertaining to maintaining the balance of the dharma, They didn't talk much about Self-realization as such, didn't work upon giving knowledge about the Ātmā to people.<br />

"So, if you think evolution is a religion, then I would say Sahaja Yoga is the religion. If your evolution if you call it as a religion, then Sahaja Yoga is a religion. But is a religion which takes you belo ... beyond your sustenance, beyond your religion, dharmātīt, beyond the dharma.<br />
We have amongst ourselves Hindu[s], Muslims, Christians, all kinds of people, you know that. All these people can feel it within themselves: is the religion in their stomachs, they can feel it. They can find out where is the religion. Because, I say, there, religion in the stomach is looked after by the Deities of Primordial Master whom we call as Dattātreya, in the Sanskrit language.<br />
But does't mean Hinduism. It doesn't mean Hinduism at all. But it is called as Dattātreya in the Sanskrit language, in English is Primordial Master.<br />

"But still, as you can see in the life of Christ, that coming of Christ was declared much before Christ came in by the Prophets who made prophecies. All these Prophets belong to the category of the Gurus I am talking about.<br />
So, all over the world three types of movements were on. For example, the scientist[s] on the right-hand side, we can say, and the left-hand side are the devotees of God who sing the praise of God. And in the center there were people like Moses, like Abraham, who came on this earth just to prophesize, just to protect the devotees of God.<br />
Now this middle movement of evolution, today, has reached its peak. Because all the Incarnations have arrived now, and have done Their job within you. They have occupied Their position within you, in your awareness, on these different centers. <br />
......<br />
So today we are here to know that within us all these Incarnations exist, and the force that really brought forth, really manifested, who live like human beings and work like Gurus, that force which existed in this area, which created religion within us.<br />
Religion, as we understand, organized religion, is not the religion. But the religion means: your sustaining power. You are a human being because there are ten sustaining powers within you.<br />
So, They came to sustain us and to give us full idea about these Ten Powers and to establish us in our religion as a human being.<br />
So these Gurus, who lived in that area, worked out the sustainace [sustenance] and helped us.<br />
And this is one of the greatest forces we have got, which resides within us.<br />
And whatever They have said has a very great meaning.<br />
Actually, we should say the Main Gurus are ten, but there are many other Gurus.<br />
<font color="red">And these Ten Gurus could be described as Rāja Janaka, then Moses, Abraham, and the in modern times you can say Muhammad Sāhab, and even up to Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth, in Śhirḍī, that force came in, for a short time, and then He disappeared. Nobody knows how He came there, He lived there and He died.</font> Also, if you know Nāṇaka, He was also the same force, the same Primordial Master, who was born on this Earth.<br />
Now, this is not the time to tell about individual people. But, I think, one day I will talk to you only on this subject of the Gurus.<br />
So, these Gurus first started under the Primordial Master Himself, He was called as Dattātreya."<br />

"<font color="red">Have you read the story of Sītā's father, Janaka? He was called as Videhi ... Videhi [Videha, incorporeal]. He was the only one, in the whole history, is called Videhi. Videhi means 'a detached person from his uh-uh-uh be-ing'. Like that, he is, doesn't care for, as you can say a Real Yogi: Videhi. The deha is the body. He has gone beyond the body. And He was the one who had children, who had wife, who had ee ... His kingdom, and who was a great uh-uh-uh, what you can call, a great connoisseur of heart.<br />
And when Nachiketa went to Him, uh-uh-uh because he was with a guru, and whenever this King came to him, the guru would get up, touch His Feet and make Him sit on his seat. So Nachiketa asked his guru, "Sir, why do you touch His Feet? He is a householder. Why should you touch His Feet? Why should we all get up? Because He is the father-in-law of Rāma, that's why you do it, is it?"<br />
He said, "No. Not because of that, because He is Videhi. He is the One only who can give Realization. Even Yoga Vāsiṣhṭha could not give Realization. He is the only One who is authorized to give Realization. We cannot give Realization."<br />
So Nachiketa went to Him, and asked Him, "Sir, can You [<font color="orange">gap</font>] known my Self."<br />
He said, "Why do you want to know? It's rather difficult." All those things He showed and tried to see if he is really willing.<br />
If you, for a non-willing person is very difficult.<br />
So, He took his test and all that and uh He said that, "All right, I'll see about it."<br />
Then He asked him to sleep in a room uh-uh-uh where uh he saw that it was very lavishly decorated and all gold everything, and he was wondering: "What sort of a Yogi is this? Surrounded by gold and everything, He is sitting down here. And He is supposed to be the Greatest Yogi of the ages. How is He called a Videhi?"<br />
Because He was a king, that was His life, and that's what He was like that. He was not taking money from anybody else's, OPM, other people's money. He was not a parasite. It was His own kingdom where He was living!<br />
So he looked and he was surprised.<br />
So next day, uh Rāja Janaka told him, that, "All right, uh-uh-uh-uh now, first of all, let us go and have bath in the river." So they went to the river, both of them were having a bath. While having the bath, uh-uh-uh a message came, to the King, that, "Your palace is on fire." So He said, "All right. Just now I'm meditating." He didn't say a word. And, "Don't disturb Me." Still He was meditating. Then the message came that, "Your people have all come out of the palace and they are going away." Then the message came that, "The fire is coming this side, and Your cloths and all those might get ... caught fire." Still He was meditating. But this fellow who was in [laughing:] the ... supposed to be the Yogi, the one who had gone to learn detachment, ran outside for his cloths, you see. He couldn't leave here even very few cloths but he ran outside [<font color="orange">gap</font>]<br />
[Nachiketa] "... about these things which are so important like a palace and Your family and all of them were running up." He said, "I was in tune with God. That is the Truth. The rest is all falsehood, is all māyā, is all illusion. And why worry about the illusions?"<br />
And He too had only one disciple only He gave Realization, is Nachiketa.</font><br />
This is the trouble. If they could give Realization en masse, they may come down, but They cannot. And once person born on the tenth floor, the rest on the ground floor, cannot make them understand. They cannot understand him."<br />

<font color="red">In this Bhavasāgara -- oc... Bhavasāgara means the ocean of this world -- were born, through this ocean of the world, were born all the Primordial Masters, one after another. We can say Abraham, Moses, we had Janaka, were Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], and Socrates, and so many others like that, Nāṇaka, and also very recently, we had about hundred years back, a very great Saint born in India known as Sāī Nāth.<br />
They all represent the same element that is the water element. Being responsible or being born out of that, They are anxious to maintain water element as the one which is within us for sustaining ourselves. We su... we are sustained by water, so They help us to sustain ourselves. They are the sustainers: They tell us how to sustain us as a human being.<br />
And all of Them have tried to establish religion within us.</font><br />
A religion doesn't mean outside, but the religion as a man: means the capacity of a man, or you can say the quality of a man. What a human being should be like, what is the way to know if he is a human being or not, which is described in al... in the Ten Commandments."<br />

"Now, all the Gurus, all the Gurus who came, say from ... we can start from Socrates, then Abraham, Moses, this is the Guru Tattwa, is the Principle of Master, Primordial Masters. The Principle is born again and again. In India we can say the Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], we had one Ādināth, the Guru long time back. <font color="red">Then we had Dattātreya, we had uh Janaka, Nāṇaka, Sāī Nāth.</font> We had in the Middle East Muhammad Sāhab, Lao Tze in China, Confucius. <font color="red">All these Great Principles of Gurus who were born, They had one job to do is to establish your dharma. Their job was not to give you Realization.</font><br />
You must understand: everyone has one's own job. See, Mine is a horrible job [laughing:] because I have to do everybody's jobs.<br />
<font color="red">But Their job was just to establish your dharma. They came at that time in those places where it was needed the most.<br />
So, these Ten Principles, as I told you, They established [dharma].</font><br /> 
<font color="red">They are created in the Void.</font><br />
As you see here the Void part, this part is made out of the water element. <font color="red">So, whatever miracles They did, had something to do with water, like They could create water anywhere They wanted to. They would not cure people. All of Them have created water in the desert or in the places where ... like in ... Nāṇaka has created a Pan̄jā Sāhab they call it, or everywhere They have been able to create water. Whatever They touched, They could create water out of it.</font><br />
Water is the life, life force which sustains us. Without water we cannot live! The is the sustainance [sustenance].<br />
<font color="red">But, They actually are symbolized in an ocean, in the ocean, because They give us the salt, the salt of life, which gives us the sustainance [sustenance].</font> If you see the salt, if we do not have salt in our body, we'll have no sustainance [sustenance]."<br />

He came onto this Earth to teach people the secrets of the Divine, to reveal God, and to help them cross the Ocean of Illusion themselves within their own identity. Evolution could not go further in the hands of human beings who were in the bondage of ignorance, so they were given guidance through this Incarnation of the Primordial Master (Ādi Guru) again and again in different lives. He was created as the three-headed child, Dattātreya, by Ādi Śhakti who appeared on Earth during the Tretā Yuga as Satī Anasūyā, wife of the Sage Atreya. He was born as Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara] who founded Jainism -- one of the oldest religions. <font color="red">Then he was born as Rāja Janaka, father of Jānakī also called Sītā, Rāma's wife.

They did not practice āsanas or Prāṇāyāmas, but they worshiped God through different styles of bowing. The Prophet Muhammad was the Incarnation of the same Primordial Master. He was married four times, but in His inner life He was completely detached. Śhrī Rāma's Incarnation also took place on the same channel and enlightened the path of Divine Kingship."<br />

"Human love means possession and determination.<br />
Divine Love soothes you, It raises you to a new awareness. It is something that's just flowing. Not rationality, nothing. It is to feel, feeling for the pain of others. Feeling for their longing and feeling for their aspirations. Just feel within.<br />
With Yoga [Self-realization] we become collectively conscious. We can feel our centers and that of others on the fingertips. <font color="red">As Muhammad Sāhib had said, "At the Time of Resurrection, your fingers will speak."<br /> 
The Namāz has the real ritual to know the Spirit.</font><br /> 
The Pūjās and worship all pour joy on our central nervous system. We feel the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost, the Chaitanya Laharī in living experience. We become one with the Divine and the rapport is established. The Divine Vibrations indicate and the coding if we know them, we know their meanings. Love has its own bondage -- very sweet and beautiful. We have to know the waves of the Divine Ocean of Grace and enjoy them."<br />

"Sahaja Yoga is very difficult for the Jains. If the Jains come into Sahaja Yoga they are very difficult people. Because their traditions are very shallow.

<font color="red">"According to me, Hazrate [Hazarat] Muhammad was one of the greatest incarnations because he was even greater than a Prophet. He announced some prophecies which none of the incarnations, such as Jesus, had described. The first thing he said was that we must have Meerraj [Mirāj], meaning the ascent through different levels. And at the third level he described how he met with all the previous Prophets such as Ibrahim, and he described the ascent on the white horse which is actually the power of Kundalini [Kuṇḍalinī]. Secondly, he said that when you receive your realization you have to fully surrender, meaning "Islam", and then your hands will speak. He did not condemn any previous religion or incarnation. For example, the Kabe Makeshwara [Kaaba Makkeśhwara] is also described in the Indian Koran [Qur'ān]. And thirdly, he described the next advent that is going to come. He never said that he was the last one. What shows that he never said he was the last is that he said that I am the seal, meaning that he was the stamp of the Prophets. He described the work of the advent of Mandi [Mahdī]. The word of Mandi [Mahdī] actually means the incarnation of the great primordial Mother -- Ma + Adi [Ādi]. No one has prophesised [prophesized] so clearly about Sahaja Yoga except for Hazrate [Hazarat] Muhammad who has described Sahaja Yoga in his great book of Koran [Qur'ān]."</font><br />

"To make the people cross the Void (Bhavasāgara) He has to make some arrangement. So the Great Power like Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, Maheśha was created and They were placed in the Area of Dharma.<br />
<font color="red">Dattātreya and Ādi Gurus incarnated in this world many a times. He incarnated as King Janaka who was like the father of Ādi Śhakti. After that He incarnated in Iran as Zoroaster, then as Macchindranāth, then as Muhammad Sāheb and Nāṇak Sāheb.</font><br />
No one fought with each other. See what type of darkness you are in?<br />
<font color="red">Fāṭimah, the daughter of Muhammad Sāheb was the same who became daughter of King Janaka.</font><br />
Whom are you fighting? Think over it.<br />
The Nāṇakī of Guru Nāṇaka was none else but Jānakī.<br />
Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth was also an Ādi Guru.<br />
<font color="red">They are the Masters of all.<br />
Also, They are My Gurus. These Ādi Gurus taught Me all this Knowledge. In different Incarnations They kept Me teaching.<br /> 
Ultimately I had to come and do His work. They could not do it and now They are placing Me as a Guru so that I take up the job of a Guru.<br />
There was an age when no one was willing to accept a woman as a Guru but in Kali Yuga only Mother could do His work: it is beyond the power of men.</font><br />
This work could not be done by force, only the love of a Mother could do it because already there is so much pressure, tension in this world. The day it is forced upon the human being they will break down. So, love is the only way out.<br />
So this Gurudom was given to Me. Everything is acceptable to Me.<br />
But I didn't know the qualities of a Guru.<br />
Gurus maintain distance but mother does not keep distance with the children. Children sit on her head.<br />
So, you people also could take liberty with Me and enjoy. Be with Me with full freedom, you will neither be afraid nor be embarrassed. There is no problem, you could come and talk to Me boldly about your problems. You could complain to Me as you do to your mother. I am freely available to you.<br />
Freedom was needed, religion was required to be discussed openly, there is no secret, no secret about it. Ultimately everything has to be explained very clearly. All the secrets are to be told about, everything could not be said everywhere."<br />

"And that's why our dharma, the dharma of the whole world is distorted. Nobody would believe now that Hindu Dharma, was taken to such an epitome by Saints like Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, who was highly realized, where it has been now degraded. <font color="red">Where is Muhammad Sāhab and what is His religion now?</font> Where Jesus Christ and what His religion is now? I can't see how people are walking blindly in the wrong directions.<br />
......<br />
But before reaching the Heart chakra, the gap I showed you, is all the Bhavasāgara. In the center is the seat of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, and on it Śhrī Brahmadeva creates the whole universe. He made this Bhavasāgara.<br />
After creating the Bhavasāgara, the question was, 'How to cross it over? The human being was created, but how to make him realize it? How to make human beings recognize it? In him, how to activate the Brahma Tattwa?' Meaning, 'How to get the Union of Śhiva and Śhakti within him? How would the connection be established?'<br />
For this, a special personality was created in this world. This was created by the combined essence of Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, and Maheśh, who we acknowledge as Śhrī Dattātreya. Śhrī Dattātreya is none other than Ādi Guru.<br />
He is My Guru. He has mentored Me all His past lives.<br />
If you hear about His birth and all His previous lives you would be amazed. We have forgotten such a great thing.<br />
Śhrī Dattātreya's Incarnations are numerous. Firstly He came as King Janaka. Śhrī Sītājī was His daughter, who was the embodiment of Śhakti Herself. <font color="red">Then He came as Macchindranāth, Zoroaster, and Muhammad Sāhab, who were a completely different type of human being.</font><br />
They trialed out lots of different things.<br /> 
Śhrī Datta, the Primordial Masters firstly in this world educated us about the symbolic forms within us. And then also said that, "You people got entangled in symbolism, in idol worshiping." Their meaning was to go beyond and recognize the Śhakti within these idols. That's why They talked about the idols.<br />
<font color="red">For example, there is a flower, and to describe the honey within the flower, They talked about the flower first, from which the people would taste the honey. But people got stuck to flower. So Then they took Incarnations and talked about the honey.<br />
In that, They talked about God in the abstract. They deliberately didn't talk about the reincarnation of life.</font><br />
Because as soon as you talk about past lives, people ask Me, "Mātājī, tell me about my past lives." The life that has passed, why do you want to know that? Whether you were a king or a pauper, what difference it will make?<br />
<font color="red">That's why They did not discuss past lives.<br />
Muhammad Sāhab was the same, Dattātreya's Incarnation, and the same Incarnation was King Janaka.</font> The same Incarnation was Nāṇaka, whose sister Nāṇakī, was the same Ādi Śhakti. She was Sītājī.<br />
<font color="red">Now, what can I say, you would be surprised, that the Shia sect that started after Muhammad Sāhab, His daughter was Fāṭimah, She was also Ādi Śhakti.</font><br />
And Her two children were, Hasan and Husayn, back then, when They saw even after the annihilation of the world, the human beings did not understand, then They were born as Buddha and Mahāvīra and They brought the non-violence as religion, and attempted that, 'Maybe with the establishment of non-violence people will achieve Self-realization.' But couldn't do it.<br />
Now you are fighting amongst each other.<br />
I always say, "If a Muslim gets obstructed from getting his Realization, you take the name of Dattātreya." <font color="red">And if [a] Hindu gets obstructed, I say, 'You take Muhammad Sāhab's name.'</font><br />
......<br />
<font color="red">After that, Āgñyā chakra, when we come Āgñyā chakra, you would be surprised that we suddenly arrived in a very modern era. Before Muhammad Sāhab, a few days earlier, Jesus Christ was born.</font><br />
......<br />
<font color="red">Like Muhammad Sāhab constantly said, "At least don't drink alcohol." But the Muslims drink so much, and the amount of poetry they have created in the name of drinking and wine, you won't find anywhere in the world.</font><br />
<font color="red">Meaning is, I say on behalf of Muhammad Sāhab, 'Is this the religion of Muslims?'</font> On behalf of Īsā Masīh, 'Is this Christian religion?' And on behalf of Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, I ask, 'Is this Hindu religion?' Which are based on myths."<br />

"The same Śhrī Dattā incarnated many a times on the Earth.<br />
As I told you yesterday, King Janaka was one of Them. King Janaka was the father of Jānakī [Śhrī Sītā]. He was none other than the Incarnation of Śhrī Dattātreya.<br />
Thereafter, Macchindranāth, most have you must have heard His name, was also His Incarnation.<br />
After that Zoroaster who came three times on the Earth, He was also His Incarnation.<br />
<font color="red">After that Muhammad Sāhab, who was His Incarnation.<br />
And when He was asked that, "Bhāī [Brother], there must have been others also before You," then He replied, "Yes, there [was] a Muhammad." Then again He was asked who was before Him. He replied, "There was one Muhammad."<br />
Muhammad means Praise, the One who is praised, the One who deserves to be praised and is the One who is Redeemer of the world.<br /> 
They were all Muhammads, They were all Dattātreyas, who came on Earth regularly.</font><br />
After that [was] Nāṇaka, Guru Nāṇaka. If you ever read His teachings, if you read His talks then you will be surprised that He has always talked in a Sahaja. He has said, "Sahaja Samādhi lago." He has said, "Kāhe re ban khojan jāe, Sarab nivāsī sadā alepā tohī saṃg[a] samāī, Puṣhpamadhya jo bāsa basata hai mukara māhī jaise chhāī, Taise hī harī base niraṃtara ghaṭa hī khojo bhāī." ["Why to go to forest to find Him, He is always there with you just like there is a fragrance in a flower and just as the reflection is there in a mirror, in the same way God is residing in you eternally, seek Him within."] He is just inside, achieve Him just inside. We are just singing poem, singing songs, we are just cramming His prescription.<br />
The talk of seeking this Absolute Principle, residing just inside the heart, has been made since ancient times by these Ādi Gurus, who are incarnated on this Earth again and again."<br />

"The one who desires gets it in no time. You should achieve the reality. But the thing should be real.<br />
That's why I say that just now there is no need to come to My Feet. Considering his or her self-esteem in mind no one should go at anybody's feet. <font color="red">Therefore, Muhammad Sāhab prevented to go to anybody's feet, nobody needs to go.</font><br />
Yes but when you get your Realization, when you achieve quite enough, then you will come to know that these vibrations flow tremendously through these Feet only.

"The second fault I notice is when a Human is alive, they make His life miserable and after His death glorify Him.<br />
Sītājī was driven out of Her house, no Saint bothered about it. When She died, they built thousands of temples for Her.<br />
Christ was put on the cross and when He died they built hundreds of temples. I cannot understand this. When He was alive, did people not have eyes? Those who understood Him, at least one or two were there, they did not listen to them. He had done amazing things, they did not notice that and they put Him on the cross!<br />
<font color="red">Muhammad Sāhab also met the same fate.</font><br />
Gñyāneśhwar met a different fate. When He died, they made scores of temples in this city of Mumbai.<br />
It is very difficult to understand humans. When a Great Man is alive, a man turns away from Him, and when He dies in His Spirit, then he will carry Him on his head and try to identify with Him and goes about claiming, 'He was so-and-so,' his disciple, etc.<br />

"Now the ... these three aspects, the essence of these aspects, or we can say the innocence of these three aspects, is combined in the Primord[i]al Guru, or the Ādi Guru Dattātreya, who resides in the Bhavasāgara and helps Śhrī Viṣhṇu for your evolution.<br />
Now He has taken many Incarnations, mainly Ten Incarnations. And these are very important, and we have to understand Them in Their full entirety.<br />

Human beings, like fools, have taken away the living flowers of one tree, and now are fighting on something that is dead.<br />
<font color="red">He was Dattātreya. There is no doubt about it.<br />
And His daughter Fāṭimah was nobody else but Sītā Jānakī Herself.</font><br />
And Her two sons, Hasan and Husayn, were nobody else but Lava and Kuśha. They were born again and again: They were born as Mahāvīra and Buddha, and then They were born as Hasan and Husayn.<br />
It is only possible through Sahaja Yoga to realize that this is the Truth, this is the fact.<br />
He was born as Nāṇaka. And Nāṇakī was nobody else but Jānakī.<br />
In Nāṇaka's life He has expressed it. Of course I don't know how many people have read about Nāṇak.<br />
Nāṇaka one day was sleeping, and His Feet were towards Kaaba. And people were getting vibrations from that side, so they said: "What are You doing your? Your Feet are towards Kaaba!" So He said, "All right, I'll turn My Feet's on the other side." And they started getting vibrations from the other side. They said, "What? Kaaba has moved or what?"<br />
He has, in a way, showed.<br />
'But how dare They say many things?' When They said very few thing[s], they have killed all these people and tortured Them.<br />
<font color="red">If you read Muhammad Sāhab['s] life, you will feel, 'What foolish people we have been, the way we have tortured [Him]!'<br />

Actually was poisoned. He had no place where to hide His head the way people were after Him, because He was telling the Truth.<br />

Like He forbade two things, like not to smoke a cigarette and not to consume alcohol.<br />
Alcohol is entirely not allowed. Here, in Sahaja Yoga, if someone is habituated to drink alcohol, they will leave it. If they don't leave alcohol, it will [not] be in moderation because both of these things go against Guru Tattwa.<br />
If Guru Tattwa is not established within us, we cannot have our evolution. Guru Tattwa is essential. Guru Tattwa is one destiny for all religions. There is one flow from all the religions."<br />

But there was a general rules, even Nāṇak Sāhab we can ...... And Nāṇak Sāhab organized a very thick book, just a symbol of wisdom of many Great Souls, that you can only go and bow to that and not to anybody else.<br />

<font color="red">Even the word Mussulman, Muhammad Sāhab has again and again talked of a Rebirth.</font><br />
You have to find your Self.<br />
......<br />
That doesn't mean that I'm preaching anything Hinduism or anything like that. All the Saints, I will tell you. I will also tell you about Christ where He exists. <font color="red">I'll also tell you about Muhammad Sāhab where He exists, about all of Them.</font><br />
So, it is no question of one religion or anything. But these are different things which came in the evolutionary process of man, and all the evolution that took place in every human being is within himself.Is recorded, and he's standing on that.<br />
......<br />
<font color="red">Muhammad Sāhib has clearly said, "No intoxications. Nothing! Nothing at all!"</font><br />
Nāṇak has said the same.<br />
<font color="red">They are both the same people, you will be surprised. Same people born at different times: same people, teaching the same thing.</font><br />
Nāṇak said the same thing: "No smoking, nothing!"<br />
But today there are no Sikhs, in the morning they were.<br />
Sikhs are fighting in London, that, "We should not wear the helmets." Imagine.<br />
<font color="red">Where is it written? In which book Nāṇak Sāhab has written this, I would like to see. That helmets -- on the contrary He said, "Bheṣh kā kyā phāyadā kā?," "What is the use of changing your dress?"</font><br />
And they are fighting on this point.<br />
But the ways a Sikh's drink in London, I mean the Britisher are ashamed. Say, I mean, they ... they think they are no good compared to Sikhs, the way they can consume.<br />
And they are fighting in the name of religion! Is a fact, I'm telling you.<br />
That the helmet they cannot wear! Because they must have a right and freedom to crack their heads on a scooter. What is this?<br />
[Laughing:] And there is a big procession every, I think every Sunday they take it out, 'against protecting'. My head's off to all these people.<br />
<font color="red">That is what they have done out of Nāṇak Sāhib.</font><br />
And the Muslims, think of them, they have written poetry on drinking.<br />
Now if I say, 'You don't have to drink,'' they will think, 'This Lady is talking from [laughing:] about ten thousand years back.' But is a fact, I'm telling you: it is not meant for human consumption at all, none of these are!<br />
......<br />
He has incarnated only once on this Earth, and you'll be surprised if I tell you who was that: is Hazarat ʿAlī. <font color="red">He was the son-in-law of Muhammad Sāhab.<br />
Muhammad Sāhib is the Incarnation of the Primordial Master or the Ādi Guru, who incarnated in the Void, in the Bhavasāgara. And He is the same as Nāṇak.</font><br />
But if I tell this to Muslims, they'll kill Me, or the Sikhs will kill Me, one of the two. I don't know who will come first.<br />
I don't think this time they are going to crucify, but they are not going to like it.<br />
They are the same people! There are Ten of Them born like that. They are the same people born again and again. And They are the people, if you accept Them, in only one Incarnation, They are not going to accept it. You have to accept Them in all Their Incarnations!<br />
<font color="red">I give an example. There was a doctor who was suffering from the cancer of stomach, Muslim. He met Me in London. And when I told him, that, "You have to worship Dattātreya," he got a shock of his life! He said, "You mean to say I must give up my religion?" I said, "Your religion is in ... in imbalance. He was the same as Muhammad Sāhab. Actually Dattātreya incarnated as Muhammad Sāhib." He said, "I cannot do that! I only believe in Muhammad Sāhab!" I said, "All right, I cannot cure your [] ... cancer because cancer is because of imbalance. Is too much activity on one side."</font><br />
Overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system causes cancer. You write it down today and you can verify it. And that's why when people say I've cured cancer, I have! No doubt! Not only Me, but even this doctor who is here he has cured cancer.<br />
Cancer is only curable through the balance of Sahaja Yoga. Otherwise is not possible! Take it from Me!<br />
So the imbalance of this man, he would not listen but cancer is a vague thing that way.<br />
He had to come back. "All right Mother, I accept You." I said, "All right. Now will you place to ... pray to ... pray to Dattātreya?"<br />
A Muslim has to become a Hindu, and a Hindu has to become a Muslim. A Sikh has to become a Muslim, and a Muslim has to become a Sikh.<br />
......<br />
In the same way, so-called Christians have done all that was necessary to kill the image of Christ. Is rather surprising.<br />
<font color="red">But I think the opposites are attracted. The drunkards will become the disciples of Muhammad Sāhab, all the licentious will become the disciples of Christ, and all the, that we call in Sanskrit Drāviḍī [laughing:] Prāṇāyāmi, will become the Hindu.

And Hazarat ʿAlī is a very-very Great Incarnation where only once, only once, Brahmadeva has incarnated and He has incarnated as Hazarat ʿAlī.<br />
So, these people are so great! You cannot criticize Them. They are so great: every word that They have spoken is a Mantra. Everything They have told you about this Namāz, which is nothing but Kuṇḍalinī jāgṛuti [awakening].<br />

How can you criticize Him? I can't bear to hear even a word about ... against Him. I know how much He has been tortured. And the same people, today, are born in this country who are talking against Him. When you cannot ris [rise] even at His Feet, why should you take such a big step?</font> Understand, 'What have you done in life?

<font color="red">"When they talk of Muhammad Sāhab, they must know that He had to take the help of fife women to be there. And they were alone better than the other, all of them were uh-uh-uh muihs [muhsin], with Him, the powers. They were the powers that He had, and that's how He had to marry so many. None understands what was it. For example His own first wife Khadija was nobody else but Mahāsaraswatī. His own daughter was nobody else but Mahālakṣhmī. So it was all His Powers expressed as His wife, or sister, or daughter who helped Him in His lifetime, sustaining His Powers."</font><br />

"Now, this Guru was created when the world was created itself. Because we ... one had to create a Guru before the world was created in then Vaikuṇṭha Stage only.<br />
But then He reincarnated many a times.<br />
At the time of Rāma, very early, even before Rāma came into this world, much earlier than that, He was created by Satī Anusūyā. She was Herself a part of the Ādi Śhakti, who created Him out of the essences, the innocence of Brahmā, Viṣhṇu and Maheśh.<br />
There's a legend about it which I will tell you sometime.<br />
And She created Him. Actually, She created Him, so She's the Mother.<br />
But then, She becomes the Guru.<br />
When She is born as Sītā, He becomes the father. So, She ... father is Her Guru.<br />
<font color="red">Then, when Rāja Janaka is born as Muhammad Sāhab, then She becomes again the daughter.</font><br />
But when He is born as Nāṇaka, then He becomes the ... She becomes His sister.<br />
So the relationship exists and whenever He is born, She is born, in a way, that, you see, that relationship is kept a sublime relationship. I mean to say: that they are never born as husband and wife."<br />

"I have told you about Nābhī chakra and also about Void. The Guru Principle resides in this Bhavasāgara [Void] and this Guru Principle establishes the dharma within us. These ten petals here that we have shown are the ones which establishes the Ten Dharmas within us.<br />
It is important to have these Ten Dharmas in a human being otherwise he is not a human being. Even if he has has nine dharmas in him is still [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] a bit and if he does not follow these dharmas that are within him, and when I say dharma I don't mean by Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and all that, but dharma means the Innate Dharma of humanity within, if one does not keep to those Ten Dharmas, then he turns into a demon [devil].<br />
<font color="red">This Guru Principle (Tattwa) has taken birth in this world in many forms especially it has these Ten Main Incarnations have taken birth like Rāja Janaka, Nāṇak, Muhammad Sāhab, etc. and at the end it was Sāī Nāth from Śhirḍī, who took birth. They tie this Tattwa [Principle] within us because all these Gurus who have taken birth for our evolution are placed within us.</font><br />
[<font color="orange">unclear</font>] these Gurus are very subtly placed Deities within us.<br />
Like for these Guru already say, "Don't consume alcohol," then They weren't mad that They said this. Neither They were standing in any elections to win votes that They said that. You can't even say that They had any kind of business that in some competitive feeling He said that thing.<br />
They said, "Child, don't drink alcohol, don't take to cigarettes, don't take any kind of drugs," because the position of our attention within is also placed in the area of Void.<br />
You will be surprised to know that our attention is in our stomach. Actually, to be specific, in liver resides our attention.<br />
They said, "You don't drink alcohol," so your attention does not get spoiled. You know by drinking human awareness gets damaged.<br />
People got the other way by saying, 'OK, if drinking is not allowed then let's not garlic, onions, etc.' <font color="red">Prophet Muhammad used to eat garlic, onions and also Nāṇaka used to eat meat and all that.</font><br />
......<br />
<font color="red">This is the Virāṭa. Virāṭa, the One we call it as Akbar, that is why Muslims call it Allah hu Akbar. The Akbar Muhammad spoke about was Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. He spoke about Kṛiṣhṇa, He is the One who takes the form of Virāṭa. There can't be any fight of Muhammad and Kṛiṣhṇa as One was the Guru [and] He was the Virāṭa.<br />
Then you will say, 'Then Kṛiṣhṇa was greater than Him.'</font><br />
So tell Me in your case, if your eyes are bigger or nose? That your ear is bigger or your mouth?<br />
Everyone has Their own space, Their own importance [points towards the human Chakra Chart and describes the Virāṭa].<br />
......<br />
Now in this Void we have two great entities as well which we know as Chandra [Moon] and Sūrya [Sun]. Moon and Sun are such chakras which reside on these nāḍīs here and here [likely pointing towards the Chakra Chart]. On these chakras there are two very great personalities who have been appointed. They are complete embodiment of human beings. They are like humans, in fact are humans. Out of these one is Buddha and one is Mahāvīra.<br />
But if you listen to the whole history of Their lives, then these are two sons which Śhrī Sītā had as Lav and Kuśha who is completely in human form. And after They evolved to the level that They are here as Buddha and Mahāvīra. There also they thought They have reached an extreme of nonviolence because the supports of nonviolence came in and started protecting even mosquitoes and bugs.<br />
Then They again took birth and came at the time of Muhammad. <font color="red">Muhammad was an Incarnation of Śhrī Janaka and His daughter Fāṭimah Bi was also Incarnation of Śhrī Sītā.</font><br />
Then, as Their sons as Hasan and Husayn, They gave their life in Karbalāʾ to prove that no kind of extreme is good."<br />

People will not accept this saying but you people [please] see in vibrations, then you will understand that I am not telling a lie to you. [<b>Variant:</b> People will not believe this but you can check on vibrations and you will realize that I'm telling the truth.]<br />
Therefore those who have liver, etc. takalīph [problem, difficulty] or have the problem of diabetes because of this chakra, what I told you, due to imbalance, those who are rajoguṇīs [right-sided] people, that problems those [people] get, the treatment of all those problems is taking the name of Hazarat ʿAlī Sāhab. [<b>Variant:</b> Therefore, people who have problems with the liver or are suffering from diabetes because of imbalance, the people who are right-sided and have problems, all such problems can be cured by taking the name of Hazarat ʿAlī Sāhab.]<br />
The problems get removed by this only. It's a matter of great surprise, but it's true [correct, right].<br />
[If] Muslims will accept this then you will not and [if] you māniyegā [will agree (with), accept, honor] Kṛiṣhṇa, then Muslims will not accept. [We] have to be realized (pār) in the world.

If you are realized, that is Alla hu Akbar, means Allah who is the Virāṭ. And Virāṭ is the description of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br />

"It is surprising that there is a gentleman in Rangoon who is an Avadhūta. Not only in India, but they can be found all around the world. <font color="red">Prophet Muhammad was an Avadhūta.</font> King Janaka was an Avadhūta, so was Nāṇak.<br />
Many of them [Avadhūtas] did a lot of work in this Maharashtra. It is only because of their work here did I take My birth in this place.<br />
Sāī Nāth was the last of them from Maharashtra.<br />
Their work establishes the dharma. Or more like the dharma settles down in that place. They take their form on this earth only to fulfill that goal.<br />
When the human loses his faith in dharma, 'Why should I do this?', when he starts thinking this ways, then the Avadhūtas take birth on this Earth. And wherever they may be, in forests or mountains, dead or alive, all they do is keep working on giving you the validations of dharma.<br />
If you tell lies and start suffering from its consequences, then realize that there is some Avadhūta, sitting on some mountain in the Himalayas, who is responsible for whatever is happening to you. He is the one putting you all right.<br />

<b>Version 1:</b><br />
"You might be knowing of Algeria, many Muslim people stay over there. And the people there are very bounded by their religion. Much more than us. And due to that, their children, who became doctors, engineers, architects, they said that they don't want any of this religious rubbish. "You waste your time in all this, read Namāz five times a day, break your heads, do whatever you want, but we are not getting into all this," they say.<br />
It was in such times that a young boy from there happened to come visit Me in London and I gave him his Realization. <font color="red">After Realization, I explained him everything: dharma means what, who is Prophet Muhammad, what is His role in our ascent.</font> Then, who is Christ. Furthermore, who is Rām, Kṛiṣhṇa, what is the meaning of all these Incarnations.<br />
And when he went back, he gathered all his friends and told them that what they thought about God was not true. God does exist. There is an All-pervading Power. The only problem was that they had never recognized their Spirit, so they were wandering about like blind people. And then they gave Realization to five hundred other people.<br />
......<br />
Now, living by the dharma doesn't mean making rounds of the temple and reciting the name of God a thousand.<br />
The meaning of dharma has been told by a number of Saints in this country. In this Land of Saints, a number of Gurus have come and have spoken to great lengths about what dharma is, we can't thank Them enough. But we don't follow any of what They have said.<br />
Out of all the Gurus, there have been Ten Important Ones and They have come in this world multiple times. <font color="red">The Prophet Muhammad is an incarnation of Dattātreya. After Muhammad Sāhib, Nāṇak who came on this Earth was an incarnation of Dattātreya too, so was Janak.</font> Likewise Ādināth, who came before Māhavīr, was also an incarnation of Dattātreya. Furthermore, the people of this Ahmednagar are extremely fortunate in the sense that Śhirḍī [84 kms NNW from Ahmadnagar] was the place where Śhrī Sāī Nāth chose to come and stay. He too was an incarnation of Dattātreya. So, it is the same element of the Guru, which keeps reincarnating on this Earth.<br />
They focused on teaching about things pertaining to maintaining the balance of the dharma, They didn't talk much about Self-realization as such, didn't work upon giving knowledge about the Ātmā to people.<br />
The one thing that all of Them had said was to not consume alcohol.<br />
......<br />
Now, the chakra on top of that is called that Sahasrāra chakra. When the Kuṇḍalinī pierces this chakra and passes through it, only then can it be said that the person has attained his Self-realization. <font color="red">Christ has called it the Baptism, Muhammad has called it Pīr, it has been said in all the religions that you need to get your Second Birth.</font><br />
......<br />
So, likewise, such unauthorized people claiming to be higher above others have always insulted the Saints and made their lives miserable. Not only in India, but also elsewhere.<br /> 
<font color="red">Prophet Muhammad was tortured by such people as well. He and His family were tortured so much more than Dñyāneśhwar, actually.</font>"<br />
<b>Version 2:</b><br />
"You might know of Algeria, many Muslim people stay over there. And Muslim people over there are blind followers of faith. Much more than us. And due to that fanaticism, their children, who became doctors, engineers, architects, they said that they don't want any of this rubbish. "You spend your time in all this, read Namāz five times a day, break your heads, or go to Kaaba, do whatever you want, but we are not getting into all this, enough of it."<br />
It was in such times that a young boy visited Me in London and I gave him his Realization. <font color="red">After Realization, I explained him everything: dharma means what, who is Prophet Muhammad, what is His role in our evolution.</font> Then, who is Christ. Furthermore, what is the meaning of all these Incarnations such as Rām, Kṛiṣhṇa.<br />
And when he went back, he gathered all his friends and told them that their idea about God was not true. There is God. There is an All-pervading Power. The only problem was that they did not recognize their Ātmā, so they were wandering about like blind people. But one can get vision. And then he gave Realization to five hundred other people. 
......<br />
To live with dharma does not mean parroting the name of God in the temples.<br />
The meaning of being religious has been explained by a number of Saints in this country. In this land of Saints, a number of Gurus have come and have spoken to great lengths about what dharma is, we can't thank Them enough. But we don't follow any of what They have said.<br />
Out of all the gurus, there have been Ten Important Ones and They have come in this world multiple times. <font color="red">Of these the Prophet Muhammad is an Incarnation of Dattātreya. After Muhammad Sāhib, Nāṇak who came on this earth was an Incarnation of Dattātreya too, so was Janak.</font> Likewise Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], who came before Mahāvīr, was also an Incarnation of Dattātreya. After this we were really lucky, specially people from Ahmadnagar, that Sāī Nāth who stayed in Śhirḍī [84 kms NNW from Ahmadnagar], He too is an Incarnation of Dattātreya. So, it is the same element of the Guru, which reappears on this Earth.<br />
And They taught several things regarding the balance of dharma. They didn't talk much about giving Realization as such. They did not work too much on giving knowledge on Self-enlightenment to people.<br />
The one thing He said, that all of [Ten of] Them corroborate on, was not to consume alcohol.<br />
......<br />
Now, the chakra on top of that is called Sahasrāra chakra. When the Kuṇḍalinī pierces this chakra, when it passes through the Brahmarandhra, only then can it be said that the person has attained his Self-realization.<br />
<font color="red">Christ has called it the Baptism, Muhammad has called it Pīr, it has been said in all the religions that, "You need to be reborn." You should transform into a dvij.</font><br />
......<br />
So, likewise, such unauthorized people have insulted all the Saints and monks. Not only in our country, but in most of the countries.<br />
<font color="red">Even during the times of Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon Him, the unauthorized people tortured and persecuted Him immensely. If we describe that we get to know that when compared to Muhammad Sāhib and family, even Dñyāneśhwara was not tortured so much.</font> They tried to destroy Them totally."<br />

"So the dharma that has been established in us by God Almighty because if we want to go to the Kingdom of God, then in our freedom we must desire to get to God. If someone tries to pressurize us and says, 'You must ask for God,' then it is of no use, it is not an evaluation. That is why to reach in this state, a person has to seek the God as per his own independent sweet will and not due to any pressure, or any disease or any hardships or any sorrow, but only because of the fact and realizing that, 'It is the only motive of our life to seek God.'<br />
<font color="red">That is why, when we desire for this Divine Gift, then the doors of God Almighty's Divine Blessings open for you, and around the center is a place of Ten Primordial Gurus.

They are all Incarnation[s] of one Incarnation.<br />
There is no difference between Muhammad Sāhab and Guru Nāṇak. When Muhammad Sahab saw that people are taking wrong interpretation of His Dharma and doing everything against the dharma, then He was born again as Guru Nāṇak to correct it.

"About Me also you can ask questions. There are many ways of recognizing because in this life, you have to recognize. You have never recognized an Incarnation so far. You have to recognize.<br />

<font color="red">If They are or not, if Muhammad Sāhib and Guru Nāṇak are the same personality, same people who came in different times, then what justice are we doing to Them?</font> How are we to find out? How are you to believe Me about it?<br />

"So, if you think evolution is a religion, then I would say Sahaja Yoga is the religion. If your evolution if you call it as a religion, then Sahaja Yoga is a religion. But is a religion which takes you belo ... beyond your sustenance, beyond your religion, dharmātīt, beyond the dharma.<br />
We have amongst ourselves Hindu[s], Muslims, Christians, all kinds of people, you know that. All these people can feel it within themselves: is the religion in their stomachs, they can feel it. They can find out where is the religion. Because, I say, there, religion in the stomach is looked after by the Deities of Primordial Master whom we call as Dattātreya, in the Sanskrit language.<br />
But does't mean Hinduism. It doesn't mean Hinduism at all. But it is called as Dattātreya in the Sanskrit language, in English is Primordial Master.<br />
<font color="red">He is the same who incarnated on this Earth: as Moses, as Abraham, and, say, incarnated as Muhammad Sāhab, as Rāja Janaka, as Nāṇaka, and also as Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth. Can you believe that Muhammad Sāhab is the same as our Nāṇak?</font><br />
Now in the religion of these people, the Muslims, so-called, and the so-called Sikhs, are fighting amongst themselves.<br />
Can you believe that Mahāvīra and Buddha were the same as Hasan and Husayn? Which we can prove it to you on suh ... on vibrations and on curing people. They were the same people reincarnated just to improve on Themselves. Because people believe into something which They were not, so They were incarnated just to show: that, 'This was wrong. No, no, this was, I never said it! This was the thing.'<br />
In the story of ah ... Nāṇaka, it was said that once He was sleeping, so they said, "What? You are preaching that there should be unity among Hindus and Muslims, and You are putting Your Feet towards the Mecca!" He said, "Really?" Then He turned His Feet on the other side. He said, "Mecca has moved!"<br />
He was the religion, but not His followers. They drink, He allowed them to drink, did He? <font color="red">When Muhammad Sāhab said, "Don't drink," that means they make a fanatic thing out of all that.</font>"<br />

"But still, as you can see in the life of Christ, that coming of Christ was declared much before Christ came in by the Prophets who made prophecies. All these Prophets belong to the category of the Gurus I am talking about.<br />
So, all over the world three types of movements were on. For example, the scientist[s] on the right-hand side, we can say, and the left-hand side are the devotees of God who sing the praise of God. And in the center there were people like Moses, like Abraham, who came on this earth just to prophesize, just to protect the devotees of God.<br />
Now this middle movement of evolution, today, has reached its peak. Because all the Incarnations have arrived now, and have done Their job within you. They have occupied Their position within you, in your awareness, on these different centers. <br />
......<br />
So today we are here to know that within us all these Incarnations exist, and the force that really brought forth, really manifested, who live like human beings and work like Gurus, that force which existed in this area, which created religion within us.<br />
Religion, as we understand, organized religion, is not the religion. But the religion means: your sustaining power. You are a human being because there are ten sustaining powers within you.<br />
So, They came to sustain us and to give us full idea about these Ten Powers and to establish us in our religion as a human being.<br />
So these Gurus, who lived in that area, worked out the sustainace [sustenance] and helped us.<br />
And this is one of the greatest forces we have got, which resides within us.<br />
And whatever They have said has a very great meaning.<br />
Actually, we should say the Main Gurus are ten, but there are many other Gurus.<br />
<font color="red">And these Ten Gurus could be described as Rāja Janaka, then Moses, Abraham, and the in modern times you can say Muhammad Sāhab, and even up to Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth, in Śhirḍī, that force came in, for a short time, and then He disappeared.</font> Nobody knows how He came there, He lived there and He died. Also, if you know Nāṇaka, He was also the same force, the same Primordial Master, who was born on this Earth.<br />
Now, this is not the time to tell about individual people. But, I think, one day I will talk to you only on this subject of the Gurus.<br />
So, these Gurus first started under the Primordial Master Himself, He was called as Dattātreya.
......<br />
There's one more point I would like to tell you, that they have not yet gone here, but here [], there are the two uh more small uh-uh-uh chakras: one that belongs to, uh uh which we call as the Sūrya -- Sūrya is the-uh-uh uh uh, means the Sun, the Sun center -- and the another as the Moon center on the left-hand side. And these two are uh governed or, we can say, is uh bestowed upon by two great uh-uh-uh people, who are the Disciple Elements.<br />
And They, disciple elements were first, were born to Śhrī Rāma and Śhrī Sītā as the-ee Lav and Kuśh. And then They incarnated many a times on this Earth as disciple. One of Them is, we can say, ah ... was uh Śhaṅkarāchārya, another was Kabīra, uh like that. Then, we can say, later on, uh like, uh before Śhaṅkarāchārya, they came as Buddha and Mahāvīra. Then Śhaṅkarāchārya, and then, uh I told you, which is? Uh after Śhaṅkarāchārya came ... the Advent of Hasan and Husayn, who were the grandsons of Prophet.<br />
So these have been incarnating, and they have been moving from one uh-uh-uh side to another and telling people that, "This is extreme, leave it." "This is the extreme, leave it. Come in the center, and be in the center." That has been Their job. And they are the ones who are, sort of, imparting you that awareness by you become a perfect disciple.<br />
And the ... this is a very important point because it comes, quite often, that uh-uh-uh we do not understand.<br />
<font color="red">Like Prophet Muhammad said that: "I am the last Prophet." All right, He did say He was the last Prophet.</font><br />
Supposing I say, I am the last person to come here. All right I would say just to frighten you that, 'h-oh, you better take to it otherwise this is the last time I am telling you!' [Laughs.]<br />
But it is never that!<br />
Because when He wa... died He found out: that, you see, these people are madcaps. 'I didn't tell them this, what are they doing out of Me?' So, He said, 'I better go back again.'<br />
And He came as Nāṇaka. And He told them, that: "Hindu and Muslims are same people, following the same religion, why are you fighting among yourselves?" See, They came for that unity.<br />
Then as Nāṇaka He came. So, in Nāṇaka's system also the Sikhism came in and they started a warrior class and this and that. I mean imagine, the Sikhism ended up by having wars within Muslims and Hindus.<br />
<font color="red">So, then He came as Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth to teach them.</font><br />
<font color="red">Now, this is not a very important thing that, say Muhammad Sāhab said, "I am the last." Say He is the last, all right, even take that position. Who are you to Him? How are you related? Through what? What is your authority? How do you appropriate Him to yourself? Because you say you are Muslims, so what? How did you become Muslims? Did you get your certificate from God?</font>"<br />

 "Self is most important.<br />
That's why He [Lord Buddha] believed this a ... anīśhwaratv, means atheism. He said, "There's no God. Only thing, the Self is to be achieved."<br />
Naturally. Because there was nobody to tell Him that, 'You have achieved through the Grace of the Primordial Mother.'<br />
<font color="red">So He was to be born again as one of the sons of Fāṭimah Bi, who was the daughter of Muhammad Sāhab.</font> Then again He was to be born as Mārkaṇḍeya, and again as Śhaṅkarāchārya: just to neutralize what He has been preaching.<br />
......<br />
The thing that really gives you the balance is the sustainance [sustenance], is the sustainance [sustenance], dharma. If you do not have that, then you could go, shoot off like a pendulum from this side to that.<br />
But in dharma also there could be a problem, and that is one of the worst possible, is of fanaticism. So, I mean, if you try to make the dharma a fanatic idea.<br />
<font color="red">Like none of these Incarnations, like Muhammad Sāhab who was a[n] Incarnation of the Primordial Master, and all others like Him, Moses, Abraham, any One of Them who came on this Earth, ever thought of fanaticism. Never they realized, that when they told, 'Don't do this,' 'Don't do that,' some sort of people will take up upon themselves that, 'We are the chosen ones. We are the great.' I mean, this They could never understood. And whenever They found it was happening again They took birth. Again They took birth to tell people: 'This is not dharma.'</font><br />

"And you are not to bow to anyone. That's why it's prohibited to bow to anyone who is not a realized Soul.<br />
<font color="red">It went to such a limit, at the time of Muhammad Sāhab, that He saw to it, He said that, "Don't bow your head too much. Just don't bow." Because He started talking about the abstract.</font><br />
We ... the trouble was, in the beginning, this, they knew about the Deities, they started talking about the Deities. But when they found that people were not going to the real Deities but must just creating Deities of their own, and they were worshiping those Deities and just doing all ritualism, and no essence in it, so they said, "All right, let us talk of the essence."<br />
......<br />
Now when They said, "Don't drink," you say, 'Oh-oh, that's out-of-dated. <font color="red">You see, there's Muhammad Sāhab, was no good. He told us not to drink.'</font> Nāṇaka said, "Don't drink."<br />
Now, smoking, you see the results of smoking, now what's happening with smoking. It goes against uh uh your Viśhuddhi. Because, you see, that is the place of Kṛiṣhṇa, and smoking started much later. You see, when He was much earlier, smoking started later on.<br />
That's why Nāṇak Sāhab has talked about it much more.<br />
<font color="red">But uh Muhammad Sāhab did see this point, He did see. So He said, "All ... all the inter... intoxicants and all habits are to be discarded. All such things must be discarded." So, He also wanted mhh yeah ...</font><br />
...... [Conversation to identify the English word addiction.]<br />
<font color="red">All these addictions must be given up. He said it, very clearly: "No addictions are allowed," according to Him.</font><br />
But you see, how you make uh-uh-uh uh-uh fuss about things.<br />
<font color="red">Like Muhammad Sāhab and all these Gurus, all these Great Incarnations of the Primordial Master who was Ādi Dattātreya, Ādinātha [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], They taught you how to maintain your religion, your sustainance [sustenance], your balance.</font><br />
So, immediately the Christians. Because Christ didn't talk much about it because Moses had talked about it, Abraham had talked about it. So Christ did not talk, so they said, "All right. So Christians can drink." Just imagine.<br />
This is a loophole.<br />
That's how they became Christians perhaps. Because they thought that if ... uh they were belonged to the Jews, you see, then they would have ... uh they wouldn't be able to drink.<br />
But Jews drink like Hell. Jews also drink now! I mean the Muslims drink the most, you see.<br />
And worst are the Sikhs: who are prohibited from drinking and smoking, they can beat all your scotch people here, you see. All your scotch whiskey goes into their stomachs [laughter], all these things, and they grow in this, this  beard, thinking that they are great Sikhs going around, you see."<br />

And this sustenance is maintained by the Gurus in that area. And They look after us: They are born again and again, again and again, to tell us about it.<br />
<font color="red">They, people might say, 'What's wrong in drink?' Why did Muhammad Sāhab say, "Do not drink," Nāṇak Sāhab said, Moses said, that, "You should not drink?" For why [They] did this?</font><br />
Now there is a reason, which you cannot stop it. If I tell you, 'Don't drink,' you come and drink.<br />
I'll give you [a] very good reason for that, absolutely scientific, absolutely scientific. But you won't stop. So what should I do?<br />
You see, which is the other way is: 'Why do you drink?' First of all I should find out the reason for it.<br />

"All this has to be integrated. All the great religions which have been propounded in the growth of human beings, which have substantially helped in the growth of human beings, which are the substratum of their living, has to be integrated in that happening.<br />
For example, I meet, supposing, a Hindu, then he says, "Mother, how do You talk of Christ? We don't believe in Christ." Now you are a very, very great person not to believe in Christ.

"When Śhrī Rām came, people said that they accepted Paraśhurām, when Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa came they said, they accepted Śhrī Rām, and at the time of Śhrī Nāṇaka, they accepted Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. When Christ was here they accepted Abraham.<br />
All of Them had taken human form. But it is all the play of buddhi: how interesting it is!<br />
Now, I have come and people are accepting Śhrī Sāī Nāth.<br />
But when He lived here, He did not even get anything to eat. Why was it so? He was also a human being. As long as He was alive, He too was considered useless and tortured. But when He died, He was regarded as Bhagavān.<br />
What is the reason of this all? Why has man been like this?<br />
You will have water of the Ganges, where She flows. If She is flowing here, will you say, 'We do not accept Her as the Ganges!'? There may be nothing at the place where She was flowing earlier, or maybe only a nullah [ravine] at present. If you want to take it as the Ganges, you go your way. If the Ganges is flowing at this place, why not accept it?<br />
It is not easy to understand human intellect. It is the most difficult job in the world! It is easy to understand God, because He is what He is. He does not have such double dealings. Man has a variety of qualities, not just double. All animals from snakes and scorpions to elephants, horses and lions are residing in him. You will not understand at all, why his brain is working in this way.<br />
Now when the Ganges is flowing why don't you take water from Her?<br />
Imagine this plug has been connected here. Will you connect in its place a plug which is out of order? It is quite pragmatic.<br />
I cannot understand what hallucination is there on human intellect, that he does not accept the Truth which he is seeing but accepts something that is not seen?
Its reason was understood long back and that is ahaṅkār [ego]. Man has too much of ego.<br />
If you had accepted Śhrī Rāma in His days, He would have told you to get your Kuṇḍalinī awakened and get the Realization and get established in Sahaja Yoga.<br />
Had you recognized Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, He would not have played Sahaja Yoga in Gokul, but would have given you the Realization and told you to practice Sahaja Yoga.<br />
If Śhrī Nāṇak had been accepted, there was no need for Him to break His head telling you to do different things. He would have simply taught Sahaja Yoga, but very few understood Him in His days.<br />
Now, when He is not here, you have built gurudwārās in His name.<br />
<font color="red">When Muhammad is not here mosques have been made, because they think now Muhammad Sāhib is in their hands.</font><br />
Now Rāma is in their hands, and they can make His temple and say, 'His is our temple, this Rāma is our property. We have authority over Him and whatever you have brought, all money and other things, offer them to this idol.'<br />
You say all this because you think you are the authority of this idol. It is sheer ego because of which man thinks, that he can keep God in his control and for that he is making all the show. Every time the same show was repeated."<br />

"You take the religion of Christians. Jesus Christ told that, "I am the Gate," "I am the Way." Śhrī Jesus Himself was the Way and Gate. But He didn't use the word Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
<font color="red">Now if someone says that, 'Is there the knowledge of Kuṇḍalinī in Muslim religion?', I would say, 'Yes, it is there completely.' Namāz means nothing else other than this. How to raise the Kuṇḍalinī is only told in the procedure of Namāz. Muhammad Sāhab told that stretch both of your hands on knees and pray through Namāz.<br /> 
Then everybody used to laugh. 'Why to do [it]?' Now today we cannot even talk to the followers of Muhammad Sāhab.<br />
Muhammad Sāhab was Incarnation of Ādi Guru Dattātreya. But how were the circumstances you should see. The Incarnation of Dattātreya was not respected. People did not understand. Yet He told about Namāz.<br />

People crucified Jesus Christ because of their ego. They could not conceive of an idea that some human being can appear on the Earth as an Incarnation of God. Their intellectual pride could not accept this idea and they rejected the Truth because of the ego.<br />
What was the bad deed for which Jesus was crucified? He had on the contrary cured many people of their ailments. He preached the Truth and taught many good things to the people. He showed them the way to live a very cultured life. He always preached Love.<br />
In spite of this, the people tortured Him. But they would bow before those who teach filthy and rotten things and make a fool of them. What a height of stupidity!<br />
These days any Tom, Dick or Harry becomes a guru, robs the people, squeezes money from them. Such persons are held in high esteem.<br />
On the contrary, if a good person, who stands by the Truth, wishes to show the true path, the people not only won't listen to him but assault him.<br />
To educate such very stupid people God Almighty sent His beloved Son, Jesus Christ, on this Earth. But the people crucified Him.<br />
They have been, ever since, repeatedly doing the same thing. If you read, you will find that whenever God incarnated, or any Sage or Saint took birth on this Earth, the people have harmed them and tortured them. Instead of learning from them, they behaved with them stupidly. We will notice the same story about Śhrī Gyāneśhwara and Śhrī Tukārāma, the great Saints of Maharashtra. <font color="red">Similar treatment was meted out to Śhrī Guru Nāṇaka and Prophet Muhammad.</font><br />

But if it is a solid, nice porcelain [soft laughter], Meissen, then there is no possibility. Then you are adhering to all that conditioning, all that solidness, and then it's very difficult. <font color="red">All the time you have to bring in Christ, or you have to bring in Muhammad, or you have to bring in Zoroaster, or someone like that, who should be there to guide you.</font><br />
Now, your guidance is your Spirit, which is unlimited. So you don't have to bring any one of Them: They are all within you, They are part and parcel of you.<br />
But to stick on to one person is again a sign that you are not expanding."<br />

"Now when I'm talking to you about the mechanism that is built within us for our last breakthrough, you need not believe Me. <br />
In our country also, this knowledge was kept a secret for thousands of years. Though we can say people like Mārkaṇḍeya, whose dates could be fourteen thousand [years ago], or later on, up to Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, people did write about the Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
And at the time of Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, He very clearly talked about it. That was the tradition of evolution described in all these great Scriptures.<br />
Even in the Bible, you find the Tree of Fire. It says: "I will appear before you as tongues of flames." <br />

"In every religion there is some sort of a stupid stuff pushed forward, in every. Nobody could really stop it. Because those people who are in charge of religion have no enlightenment, they have nothing to k... do with it, anywhere.<br />

"The Primordial Master was also born as Macchindranāth, and again as Zoroaster who was worshiped by the ancient Persians, and still revered by Parsis. Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism. In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates. <font color="red">He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya).</font> Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā). Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918. Altogether there were ten major Avatāras of Dattātreya.<br />
......<br />
<font color="red">Later They [Buddha and Mahāvīra] were born in Arabia as Hasan and Husayn, the two sons of Fāṭimah, daughter of Muhammad Sāhib.</font> They were murdered in a very violent war at Karbalāʾ. Their death signifies a great sacrifice in the name of religion. It is an indication how people who are extreme in nature take to fanaticism and, in their blindness, kill the very essence of religion that is born in flesh and blood as an Incarnation. This awakening gave a rude shock to the mass of religious human beings of the land, and there ensued a phenomenon of mass repentance. In this way people were made to realize that there can be no attachment to war for a realized Soul. Violence and nonviolence are attributes of mind but awareness is beyond these extremes. In defense of righteousness one has to go to war, but when one becomes the witness one only sees the play of war without taking any credit or discredit for it, or being disturbed by its aggression."<br />

"Rāja Yoga is a derivation of Haṭha Yoga. In this style of practice the gurus led lives like kings. They wore robes like royal personalities and ruled over the people. Rāja Janaka, another Incarnation of Dattātreya, was one such Rāja Yogi. In their inner life they were Yogis, but externally they led a royal existence, yet without attachment. They did not practice āsanas or Prāṇāyāmas, but they worshiped God through different styles of bowing. <font color="red">The Prophet Muhammad was the Incarnation of the same Primordial Master. He was married four times, but in His inner life He was completely detached.</font> Śhrī Rāma's Incarnation also took place on the same channel and enlightened the path of Divine Kingship."<br />

"Brahmadeva represents that aspect of God Almighty which manifests as the Creator of both the subtle side (esthetics), and of the gross side of material creation. Brahmadeva looks like an ascetic, a saintly personality, with a beard and mustache. He has four heads and all the hair on His heads is tied up in a top-knot. His body is thin with His most prominent feature being bulging and very large eyes. <font color="red">Brahmadeva rarely incarnates but He has incarnated once as Hazarat ʿAlī, husband of Fāṭimah and son-in-law of Muhammad Sāhib.</font> Some ancient Sages tried to explain the meaning of His four heads as the expression of creation into four <i>Vedas</i>. The meaning of His heads is much wider and deeper, though. Brahmadeva is the symbol of the Creative Power of the Supreme, the Īśhwara, Brahma, God. This creative power is expressed through the plane of matter in this universe. All material things have three dimensions but there is a fourth dimension which only human beings can see and feel. This fourth dimension is the esthetic dimension created by balanced harmonies and the integration of different textures, forms and lines. Animals have no sense of beauty; only human beings can feel the esthetics of a composition of different colors, or the movement of lines and the melting of forms. The feelings of joy acquired through this esthetic sense create a <i>Rasa</i> (a secretion of the essence or juice of a feeling). This Rasa gives one a stimulative feeling that sets in motion waves of esthetic joy within the Inner Self. These joys are of different frequencies and vibrations. One does not need to dissect them but as I look at the different petals of this chakra, I shall try to explain the kinds of joys present in the realm of creativity expressed through divine enlightenment."<br />

"<font color="red">Now, having seen all these things in the West, I can understand why Muhammad Sāhib asked women to cover their heads and their bodies. Because He was a Prophet, He must have seen the future of women in the West, where there are absolutely no rules of decency or decorum to stop women from doing anything and everything to get themselves looked at.</font> In these societies, the designers of scanty fashions and the hairdressers, it seems, are the most prosperous. It is they who have killed the beauty of romance as people fall in love on account of some hairstyle or some revealing fashion, then fall out of love the next day, because their beloved has changed her hairstyle or bought a new set of clothes.<br />
......<br />
In order to be considered attractive, (attracting what and who?) they must expose their figure and show off their legs, and so invite rape, because their faces are so expressionless. And after all, their logic seems to be in a moneymaking society, if they are no good for rape (attracting all and sundry can be a dangerous game), how will they get their publicity as attractive women or how can they "exploit their assets" and get their pay-off. <font color="red">When He insisted that women should dress modestly and decently, Muhammad Sāhib must certainly have had foreknowledge of these kind of women, who have no respect for their chastity or for their dignity, and would tend to be like animals.</font> They do not realize that animals mostly stand on their four and not just two legs to show themselves off."<br />

"Of course, the Islamic attitude towards women is extremely dangerous. <font color="red">The benevolent ideas Hazarat Muhammad propounded to protect the women and give a chaste life to them, have been worked in the opposite direction by the people who are in charge of religions. The message of Paigamber has been absolutely misinterpreted.</font> All the goodness and chastity has been practiced by women but not by men. Mothers or sisters are the feminine force of the family. They live in fear. This is a situation where the mother has to be the guiding, controlling power because the men are busy in their work. They have no time to watch and guide the children. So many women are killed by stoning for their bad behavior in the Islamic countries."<br />

"According to the Bible, Sharia is written in the chapter of Jeremiah. These laws were given by Moses to the Jews, whom He found to be in a very decadent state when He came back with His Ten Commandments. So He thought these people required a very strict kind of conduct by which they could reach a certain moral discipline and cleanliness. Otherwise such immoral people could not attain spirituality. <font color="red">Sharia was not accepted by the Jews but was taken up by Muhammad Sāhib later on because He found the Jews were not able to accept it, but He thought He would put it down for people who wanted to follow Islam, meaning surrender to the Divine. I feel it is a misinterpretation. Muhammad Sāhib could not have done it. He was Himself preaching about Rahmat (compassion) all His life. How could He talk about such strict rules for women?</font><br />
Perhaps He found the people of other religions were even worse than the decadent Jews.<br />
......<br />
<font color="red">After Christ came Muhammad Sāhib, and perhaps He felt that if all these rules and regulations were written down they were only for men. But what about the women? So He said something should be done about the women. If they follow an absolutely moral path, then men will be also automatically moral. He respected holy women. He had great respect for Christ's Mother and also for women as a whole.</font> In the Bible She is called as an ordinary woman. The idea of Madonna came from the Pagan religion which existed before Christ. <font color="red">But Muhammad Sāhib, who was the Incarnation of the Primordial Master (Prophet), knew who was the Mother of Christ.</font> In Sahaja Yoga She is worshiped as Mahālakṣhmī. <font color="red">He did not want many women to be immoral and take to prostitution. For a married woman, there are very strict punishments. It is said that in the Qur'ān He said: "Any woman, who is immoral, must be buried in the sand halfway and should be stoned," (sometimes, she could be dead.) I wonder if He said such a thing, or if it was Muʿāwiyah [ibn Abī Sufyān] who edited the Qur'ān.</font> But the way they follow it in the Islamic countries is really sinful to give this kind of punishment to all those who are considered immoral women. <font color="red">Whatever it is, it is very difficult, in these modern times, to find very moral people after the pattern that Muhammad Sāhib thought.</font><br />
<font color="red">He accepted many marriages because He didn't want women to have relationship without marriage. In those days, there were many women who survived after the death of their husbands, in the wars they had among the tribes. There were many young girls who had no chance of marriage, as many young people were killed in the wars they had in the different tribes against Muhammad Sāhib. Whatever He did at that time (samayāchār), was very essential to create a new generation of very pure and compassionate people. Both Jesus Christ and Muhammad Sāhib were not only divine but they were Incarnations who had a Special Mission to come on this Earth.</font><br />
......<br />
Every one knows very well that Muslim women are under great pressure. Once I was going to Aurangabad, and on the way My car failed near Daulatabad, meaning the city of wealth. Here there was a crowd of Muslim women. They were filling water from a tap which was broken and I got down from the car and started talking to them. They were all Muslim women who were divorced (ṭalāq) by their husbands. Each one of them had seven to eight children and no compensation was given to them. They were just starving. They were taking the water from the tap and they said that sometimes they got some work on the roads, when they were being repaired or some new roads had to be made. They lived in some sort of a shelter which had broken tin pieces or some dried leaves covered with tins and stones to hold the tin pieces together. Some houses were made of ordinary mud. They said that in the rainy season they slept under railway bridges -- absolutely the lowest and the poorest women trying to live with their children, half naked and starving. They told Me that some of the children had died and they could not get any money from their husbands. The husbands say, 'Ṭalāq,' 'Ṭalāq,' 'Ṭalāq,' three times, and they are left absolutely alone on the streets and they have to go on like this till they die. There were so many women there and tears started coming down My eyes. I just couldn't bear it. <font color="red">Even when I think about all of them, I wonder what this religion of compassion and love, of Raḥīm and Rahmat that Muhammad Sāhib had talked about, really is.</font><br />
......<br />
Both things are wrong, one has to understand that all these religions were born on the same Tree of Spirituality and that people have plucked the flowers and are fighting with these dead flowers. Of course, there are some absurd things which grew with misinterpretation and interference from unholy people, which are common in these religions. For example, Jews, Christian and Muslims believe that when they die their bodies will come out of their graves and they will all be resurrected at the Time of Resurrection, at the Time of Last Judgment, at the Time of Qiyāmah. It is so illogical to think of what will remain inside those graves after five hundred years. Nobody wants to think and understand that it is not the body but the soul that will come out of these bodies, be born again as human beings and be saved through Qiyāmah that is the Resurrection. Who will tell them? No one can talk to them. As soon as one wants to talk one can be killed. That is the only thing they know how to kill. <font color="red">The greatest problem with the fundamentalists is that they have no compassion because they do not love [know] Muhammad Sāhib, who He was and why He came on this Earth.</font> They do not know the reality. They just think that they are right type of people and that they can kill as many human beings (Kafirs) as they want, and they can create as many problems as they like, and they can destroy the rest of the people who do not follow their fundamentalism. We find that fundamentalists do not know the fundamentals of religion and the people who think they are very modern also don't know where this modern mind is going to take them. What a shock is awaited for this modern man who has lost faith in God. Both ways they try to do things which are in no way helpful for global peace; or for the ascent of human beings by which they will have their own peace within their heart.<br />
<font color="red">Actually Hazarat Muhammad never made Islam an exclusive religion in the Qur'ān. He very respectfully talked about Moses, Abraham, Christ and His Mother, one after another.</font> Even so Muslims believe they are exclusive. Jews and Christians also believe theirs are exclusive religions. <font color="red">There is another problem -- they believe that Muhammad was the exclusive messenger of God and Christians believe that Christ is the last word, while Jews believe that their Savior has yet to come. If these Incarnations were the last ones why did Muhammad say, "I will send you the Twelfth Mahdī?"</font> Also why did Christ say that He would send the Holy Ghost? We cannot say how long the Jews are going to wait for their Savior to come. They are wailing and crying before the wailing wall wearing the Torah in small amulets, but actually the most important thing for them is to collect the money that they have lent and buy diamonds at any cost.<br />
Muslims who are not educated enough to understand Qur'ān in original believe that they are the soldiers of Jihād which is led by some very clever ego-oriented educated people. <font color="red">They have not even read the Qur'ān which was edited forty years after the death of Muhammad Sāhib.</font> The editor himself was the most cruel man, who killed Hazarat ʿAlī, His two sons and two other Khalifas. It is said that the mother of this fifth Khalifa ate the raw liver of the fourth Khalifa. In this Jihād, how many Muslims are going to die? On one side they produce more children to create a Muslim majority and on the other side they are getting killed in thousands. The Jihād has become imminent and the Muslims are a real threat to peace and progress of every country they live in."<br />

"For example, the war in Bosnia is the misidentification of Croats, Muslims and Serbs. They follow the Christian and Muslim religions. The Croats are Catholic Christians but do they follow Christ? What about Muslims who believe in the Formless God and despite this fight for land? <font color="red">Actually, Muhammad never talked of an exclusive religion. He talked about Abraham, Moses and Christ in a series and the fourth was Himself. Even Christ talked about Abraham and Moses. Why do people who follow Moses, Christ or Muhammad fight? They have the same roots. At least these three religions should produce people who understand the oneness of their religions.</font> Of course, the Hindu religion is not exclusive. It accepts all the religions but even Hindus in charge of religious affairs have made different laws for different religions. They are taking advantage of the minorities for votes in the Democracy."<br />

"In Japan we had another great Master whose name was Viditama. He was the disciple of Lord Buddha and he went to Japan and started the Zen system. Zen means meditation -- dhyāna -- and he wanted people to become "thoughtlessly aware". He found out many ways of making people "thoughtlessly aware" -- the tea ceremony and the temples that they have, are all meant to create thoughtless awareness. I was amazed that none of the Japanese knew what the purpose of these gardens were. There is one garden which has some moss on top of a hill in a very small area and it is very interesting. You have to see the flowers and other foliage there through a magnifying glass. All this should amaze a person and one should become thoughtlessly aware. That was the idea of Zen, but surprisingly, few understood Zen. Then there was a Prophet, Zoroaster, who was born five times in His country, Persia. <font color="red">Ultimately Muhammad Sāhib had to come to say something very clearly about religion. But the people who followed Muhammad Sāhib, never realized the oneness of His preaching or that of Zoroaster, and they made all the Persians run away to all the other countries and so many of them came to India.</font><br />
<font color="red">Muhammad Sāhib has talked about Abraham, Moses, Christ in a series as They came one after the other. He has talked about the Mother of Christ especially with great respect. In the Bible She is not given so much respect because of Paul who edited the Bible. She is just called "the woman". But Prophet Muhammad says that anyone who talks against this Holy Lady will be punished, or something to that effect. So one can see that Muhammad Sāhib never talked of an exclusive religion called "Islam" (i.e., I surrender to God Almighty). But so many followers of Islam are fighting the followers of other religions and even amongst themselves.</font><br />
The worst part is the practice of conversion. People are being converted from one religion to another not for faith but for non-religious reasons such as matrimony or monetary gain. Bitter fights are going on in different parts of the world between followers of different religions, all in the name of God Almighty! This cruel phenomenon is not understood by any saintly person. Groups of people claiming to profess the Islamic religion are in the forefront of these fights. <font color="red">The Sufis amongst the Islamic people tried to tell them that this is not the way to behave if you are a follower of Muhammad Sāhib, because this brings a bad name to Muhammad Sāhib and to Islam. There are some people who believe that Islam should be spread by Jihād. This was never the idea of Muhammad Sāhib. At the time when He was here on this Earth, the people were facing a very difficult situation because there were lots of tribes, and these tribes were fighting and killing all the people who were taking to Islam. That was the time when it was all right to talk about Jihād, but today there is no such problem.</font> Moreover by talking incessantly of Jihād, they are becoming very unpopular. Not only that, actually, they have achieved nothing. By doing all this have they achieved their Self-realization? Have they attained their Qiyāmah and have they found the Truth? Nothing of the kind has happened to them. They are diverting the attention of people to wrong things and are trying to do something which is absolutely no good for the peace of the world. It is because of them that there are little wars going on in so many places. In Chechnya there is a war going on. Wars are going on in other countries as well, where the Muslims are thinking that they are the chosen ones and that the whole world should become Islamic."<br />

I can only take the name of Muhammad." I said, "Muhammad Himself is angry with you because you are such a fanatic. Because Muhammad was born as Nāṇaka." He said, "No, I cannot take His name." "All right," I said, "go ahead." <font color="red">I said, "All right, take the name of Dattātreya." He would not take it. He would not take the name of Moses. He said, "I only know Muhammad."</font><br />
But then he was very much worse.<br />
Then he came to Me. I said, "Now take the name of Dattātreya." You won't believe: he sat down, he said, "Mother, teach me how to do Pūjā of Dattātreya." And he got much better. I must say!<br />
There was another gentleman who was a staunch Hindu. And if they are staunch, they are the worst they can take up. [Laughter.] And I told him that he has to take the name of Muhammad. And he would not! He said, "You are finishing my religion in, what are you doing‽ You are blasphemous!" And all kind of things he said. I said, "All right. You can say whatever you like."<br />

"So the dharma that has been established in us by God Almighty because if we want to go to the Kingdom of God, then in our freedom we must desire to get to God. If someone tries to pressurize us and says, 'You must ask for God,' then it is of no use, it is not an evaluation. That is why to reach in this state, a person has to seek the God as per his own independent sweet will and not due to any pressure, or any disease or any hardships or any sorrow, but only because of the fact and realizing that, 'It is the only motive of our life to seek God.'<br />
<font color="red">That is why, when we desire for this Divine Gift, then the doors of God Almighty's Divine Blessings open for you, and around the center is a place of Ten Primordial Gurus.

"So, if you think evolution is a religion, then I would say Sahaja Yoga is the religion. If your evolution if you call it as a religion, then Sahaja Yoga is a religion. But is a religion which takes you belo ... beyond your sustenance, beyond your religion, dharmātīt, beyond the dharma.<br />
We have amongst ourselves Hindu[s], Muslims, Christians, all kinds of people, you know that. All these people can feel it within themselves: is the religion in their stomachs, they can feel it. They can find out where is the religion. Because, I say, there, religion in the stomach is looked after by the Deities of Primordial Master whom we call as Dattātreya, in the Sanskrit language.<br />
But does't mean Hinduism. It doesn't mean Hinduism at all. But it is called as Dattātreya in the Sanskrit language, in English is Primordial Master.<br />
<font color="red">He is the same who incarnated on this earth: as Moses, as Abraham, aand, say, incarnated as Muhammad Sāhab, as Rāja Janaka, as Nāṇaka, and also as Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth.</font> Can you believe that Muhammad Sāhab is the same as our Nāṇak?"<br />

"<font color="red">And when it is worked out with effort, many Gurus and many -- Real Ones, I'm saying, not, I'm not talking of the horrid ones -- but the Real Ones who have been working in the forest, and the great people like Moses, and Abraham and all these people, They knew how difficult it was to raise the Kuṇḍalinī, this coiled thing: gradually, one after another.</font><br />
And the detailed description of this is so horrifying that people get a fright.<br />
Actually when the Kuṇḍalinī rises, normally, by effort of people who are authorized to do it, is such a slow movement that at any center where there is any escape, any weakness, the attention immediately goes on the sides from the cause, from the center. Once it moves to the center, you start getting all kinds of visions."<br />

"But still, as you can see in the life of Christ, that coming of Christ was declared much before Christ came in by the Prophets who made prophecies. All these Prophets belong to the category of the Gurus I am talking about.<br />
So, all over the world three types of movements were on. For example, the scientist[s] on the right-hand side, we can say, and the left-hand side are the devotees of God who sing the praise of God. <font color="red">And in the center there were people like Moses, like Abraham, who came on this earth just to prophesize, just to protect the devotees of God.</font><br />
Now this middle movement of evolution, today, has reached its peak. Because all the Incarnations have arrived now, and have done Their job within you. They have occupied Their position within you, in your awareness, on these different centers. <br />
......<br />
So today we are here to know that within us all these Incarnations exist, and the force that really brought forth, really manifested, who live like human beings and work like Gurus, that force which existed in this area, which created religion within us.<br />
Religion, as we understand, organized religion, is not the religion. But the religion means: your sustaining power. You are a human being because there are ten sustaining powers within you.<br />
So, They came to sustain us and to give us full idea about these Ten Powers and to establish us in our religion as a human being.<br />
So these Gurus, who lived in that area, worked out the sustainace [sustenance] and helped us.<br />
And this is one of the greatest forces we have got, which resides within us.<br />
And whatever They have said has a very great meaning.<br />
Actually, we should say the Main Gurus are ten, but there are many other Gurus.<br />
<font color="red">And these Ten Gurus could be described as Rāja Janaka, then Moses, Abraham, and the in modern times you can say Muhammad Sāhab, and even up to Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth, in Śhirḍī, that force came in, for a short time, and then He disappeared. Nobody knows how He came there, He lived there and He died.</font> Also, if you know Nāṇaka, He was also the same force, the same Primordial Master, who was born on this Earth.<br />
Now, this is not the time to tell about individual people. But, I think, one day I will talk to you only on this subject of the Gurus.<br />
So, these Gurus first started under the Primordial Master Himself, He was called as Dattātreya."<br />

"The thing that really gives you the balance is the sustainance [sustenance], is the sustainance [sustenance], dharma. If you do not have that, then you could go, shoot off like a pendulum from this side to that.<br />
But in dharma also there could be a problem, and that is one of the worst possible, is of fanaticism. So, I mean, if you try to make the dharma a fanatic idea.<br />
<font color="red">Like none of these Incarnations, like Muhammad Sāhab who was a[n] Incarnation of the Primordial Master, and all others like Him, Moses, Abraham, any One of Them who came on this Earth, ever thought of fanaticism. Never they realized, that when they told, 'Don't do this,' 'Don't do that,' some sort of people will take up upon themselves that, 'We are the chosen ones. We are the great.' I mean, this They could never understood. And whenever They found it was happening again They took birth. Again They took birth to tell people: 'This is not dharma.'</font><br />

"Now when They said, "Don't drink," you say, 'Oh-oh, that's out-of-dated. You see, there's Muhammad Sāhab, was no good. He told us not to drink.' Nāṇaka said, "Don't drink."<br />
Now, smoking, you see the results of smoking, now what's happening with smoking. It goes against uh uh your Viśhuddhi. Because, you see, that is the place of Kṛiṣhṇa, and smoking started much later. You see, when He was much earlier, smoking started later on.<br />
That's why Nāṇak Sāhab has talked about it much more.<br />
But uh Muhammad Sāhab did see this point, He did see. So He said, "All ... all the inter... intoxicants and all habits are to be discarded. All such things must be discarded." So, He also wanted mhh yeah ...<br />
...... [Conversation to identify the English word addiction.]<br />
All these addictions must be given up. He said it, very clearly: "No addictions are allowed," according to Him.<br />
But you see, how you make uh-uh-uh uh-uh fuss about things.<br />
Like Muhammad Sāhab and all these Gurus, all these Great Incarnations of the Primordial Master who was Ādi Dattātreya, Ādinātha [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], They taught you how to maintain your religion, your sustainance [sustenance], your balance.<br />
So, immediately the Christians. <font color="red">Because Christ didn't talk much about it because Moses had talked about it, Abraham had talked about it.</font> So Christ did not talk, so they said, "All right. So Christians can drink." Just imagine.<br />
This is a loophole.<br />
That's how they became Christians perhaps. Because they thought that if ... uh they were belonged to the Jews, you see, then they would have ... uh they wouldn't be able to drink.<br />
But Jews drink like Hell. Jews also drink now! I mean the Muslims drink the most, you see.<br />
And worst are the Sikhs: who are prohibited from drinking and smoking, they can beat all your scotch people here, you see. All your scotch whiskey goes into their stomachs [laughter], all these things, and they grow in this, this  beard, thinking that they are great Sikhs going around, you see."<br />

And like these centers that are here, we have all these Deities, these Leaders who came to save us, on this Earth. We call it in Sanskrit Daśhāvatāras [Ten Incarnations].<br />

"All this has to be integrated. All the great religions which have been propounded in the growth of human beings, which have substantially helped in the growth of human beings, which are the substratum of their living, has to be integrated in that happening.<br />
For example, I meet, supposing, a Hindu, then he says, "Mother, how do You talk of Christ? We don't believe in Christ." Now you are a very, very great person not to believe in Christ. Who are you not to believe in Christ? What do you think of yourself? What do you mean by saying that you don't believe in Christ? Do you know it is blasphemous to say such horrible things about any Great Incarnation on this Earth?<br />
<font color="red">There are some who say, "We do not believe in Moses, or in Guru Nāṇaka, or in Muhammad Sāhib."</font> Who are you? 'I don't believe,' 'I don't believe.' What is your belief? What-what, on what it is based? Why do you say such things? What do you know about Them?<br />
Only by going to churches or going, going to these mosques or going to these synagogues! They are blind, making you blind. What have you achieved but nothing but stark fanaticism? It's a disease! It's sickness!<br />
Just come in the Kingdom of God, and you will see that They are all seated there on the dais. They are all together and you like fools are fighting. Did They ever say that?<br />
<font color="red">For example, when Christ cam ... came, did He say that, 'Moses was wrong'? Did He say so?</font> When Nāṇaka came, did He say that, 'Muhammad was wrong'? Did any one of these great Saints say so?<br />
Then who are you to denounce Them?<br />

"What it is remarkable to see, that before this, no Incarnation said publicly, that, They were Incarnations.<br />
Rāma, of course, had forgotten that He was an incarnation. In a way, He was ... He made Himself to forget, played His māyā upon Himself, to become a complete human be-ing, Maryādā Puruṣhottama.<br />
And Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa also only told one person, Arjuna, just before he was to start the war.<br />
Abraham never said that He was the Incarnation, though He was the Incarnation of Primordial Master.<br />
Dattātreya Himself never said that He was the Incarnation of the Primordial Master. With all these three forces, acting through innocence, [He] came on this Earth to guide.<br />

Those who have not recognized Me, will not be blessed. They'll be going round and round and round. So, it is necessary to recognize.<br />
Now there are some people, like, we ... I'll say, very good example is, Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth's disciples are there. Now He is no more. So they believe in Him. Now where is He?<br />
They don't want to believe in the present Incarnation! They want to believe in something that is dead. They believe in Rāma. They'll believe in Christ. Most of the Christians have this problem.<br />

He ... ah ... I told ... I asked him ... uh-uh-uh what religion was he following, he said he was a ... uh-uh-uh Muslim, and out and out Muslim. I said, "What does that mean?", so he said, "It means only Muhammad was the only last Prophet, that cannot be any other Prophet." I said, "How do you know? But how are you so cocksure about it? How can you [laughing:] claim that He was the last Prophet?"<br />

We had a Prophet in India called Guru Nāṇak, who was the Incarnation of the same. <font color="red">Abraham, Moses, all of Them were the Incarnation of the same Principle.</font><br />
But he would not accept it. I said, "I can't cure your cancer." <br />
So he went back.<br />
But when it comes to life, you understand.<br />
And he came back to Me. He said, "All right, I'll accept, and I'll take the name of Guru Nāṇak." I told him, "Muhammad Sāhāb Himself is angry with you for behaving like this. Because He was not a fanatic like you!" And when he did that, he got all right."<br />

"This is the Holy Ghost about which Christ could not talk to those mad people who really crucified Him.<br />
They were mad that they thought that, 'Christ was blasphemous.' Just think of it! And today we have churches and people, and this and that.<br />
When He lived nobody accepted Him, nobody recognized Him. <font color="red">When He came, they talked of Moses, Abraham.</font><br />
<font color="red">It is very nice to handle Christ, 'Better talk about Them, so that we don't have to face reality.'</font> Because if they had recognized Christ, then Christ would have said, 'All right, if you are recognizing Me, then get your Realization and understand your Self.'<br />

For example, we can say the gree... green thing is the one that represents the water, water element. This center the ... in the stomach is the water element within us.

So, the people who were born on this center, around this center, were born out of water element.<br />
<font color="red">In this Bhavasāgara -- oc... Bhavasāgara means the ocean of this world -- were born, through this ocean of the world, were born all the Primordial Masters, one after another. We can say Abraham, Moses, we had Janaka, were Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], and Socrates, and so many others like that, Nāṇaka, and also very recently, we had about hundred years back, a very great Saint born in India known as Sāī Nāth.<br />
They all represent the same element that is the water element. Being responsible or being born out of that, They are anxious to maintain water element as the one which is within us for sustaining ourselves. We su... we are sustained by water, so They help us to sustain ourselves. They are the sustainers: They tell us how to sustain us as a human being.<br />
And all of Them have tried to establish religion within us.</font><br />
A religion doesn't mean outside, but the religion as a man: means the capacity of a man, or you can say the quality of a man. What a human being should be like, what is the way to know if he is a human being or not, which is described in al... in the Ten Commandments."<br />

Like on a tree there's only one flower or two flowers in the beginning.<br />

He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā). Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918. Altogether there were ten major Avatāras of Dattātreya."<br />

"According to the Bible, Sharia is written in the chapter of Jeremiah. <font color="red">These laws were given by Moses to the Jews, whom He found to be in a very decadent state when He came back with His Ten Commandments. So He thought these people required a very strict kind of conduct by which they could reach a certain moral discipline and cleanliness. Otherwise such immoral people could not attain spirituality.</font> Sharia was not accepted by the Jews but was taken up by Muhammad Sāhib later on because He found the Jews were not able to accept it, but He thought He would put it down for people who wanted to follow Islam, meaning surrender to the Divine. I feel it is a misinterpretation. Muhammad Sāhib could not have done it. He was Himself preaching about Rahmat (compassion) all His life. How could He talk about such strict rules for women?<br />
Perhaps He found the people of other religions were even worse than the decadent Jews.<br />
......<br />
Actually Hazarat Muhammad never made Islam an exclusive religion in the Qur'ān. <font color="red">He very respectfully talked about Moses, Abraham, Christ and His Mother, one after another.</font> Even so Muslims believe they are exclusive. Jews and Christians also believe theirs are exclusive religions. There is another problem -- they believe that Muhammad was the exclusive messenger of God and Christians believe that Christ is the last word, while Jews believe that their Savior has yet to come. If these Incarnations were the last ones why did Muhammad say, "I will send you the Twelfth Mahdī?" Also why did Christ say that He would send the Holy Ghost? We cannot say how long the Jews are going to wait for their Savior to come. They are wailing and crying before the wailing wall wearing the Torah in small amulets, but actually the most important thing for them is to collect the money that they have lent and buy diamonds at any cost."<br />

"In Japan we had another great Master whose name was Viditama. He was the disciple of Lord Buddha and he went to Japan and started the Zen system. Zen means meditation -- dhyāna -- and he wanted people to become "thoughtlessly aware". He found out many ways of making people "thoughtlessly aware" -- the tea ceremony and the temples that they have, are all meant to create thoughtless awareness. I was amazed that none of the Japanese knew what the purpose of these gardens were. There is one garden which has some moss on top of a hill in a very small area and it is very interesting. You have to see the flowers and other foliage there through a magnifying glass. All this should amaze a person and one should become thoughtlessly aware. That was the idea of Zen, but surprisingly, few understood Zen. Then there was a Prophet, Zoroaster, who was born five times in His country, Persia. Ultimately Muhammad Sāhib had to come to say something very clearly about religion. But the people who followed Muhammad Sāhib, never realized the oneness of His preaching or that of Zoroaster, and they made all the Persians run away to all the other countries and so many of them came to India.<br />
<font color="red">Muhammad Sāhib has talked about Abraham, Moses, Christ in a series as They came one after the other.</font> He has talked about the Mother of Christ especially with great respect. In the Bible She is not given so much respect because of Paul who edited the Bible. She is just called "the woman". But Prophet Muhammad says that anyone who talks against this Holy Lady will be punished, or something to that effect. So one can see that Muhammad Sāhib never talked of an exclusive religion called "Islam" (i.e., I surrender to God Almighty). But so many followers of Islam are fighting the followers of other religions and even amongst themselves."<br />

[<b>Page 281:</b>] [To an acupuncturist follower of Śhrī Lao Tze who became aggressive when Śhrī Mātājī moved Her hand around His aura:] "<font color="red">How can you telephone with a disconnected line? You cannot follow Tao. You have to become Tao. You have to be realized otherwise all spiritual practices and gestures are tomfooleries. All your acupuncture will just activate the sympathetic nervous system. If you try to handle your machinery without establishing the connection with the source of its power, the parasympathetic system, you will spoil it. When Lao Tze was alive, how many believed in Him and how many opposed Him? Why do you believe in Lao Tze? Because He is no more and you can handle Him instead of Him handling you. Once He is dead you are using Him and following dead rituals. Today, Lao Tze is dead and Mātājī is living.</font> So many people feel the Divine Breeze in their fingers. My child, how long are you going to cheat yourself? Why not know your own powers?"<br />

"Now, all the Gurus, all the Gurus who came, say from ... we can start from Socrates, then Abraham, Moses, this is the Guru Tattwa, is the Principle of Master, Primordial Masters. The Principle is born again and again. In India we can say the Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], we had one Ādināth, the Guru long time back. Then we had Dattātreya, we had uh Janaka, Nāṇaka, Sāī Nāth. <font color="red">We had in the Middle East Muhammad Sāhab, Lao Tze in China, Confucius. All these Great Principles of Gurus who were born, They had one job to do is to establish your dharma. Their job was not to give you Realization.</font><br />
You must understand: everyone has one's own job. See, Mine is a horrible job [laughing:] because I have to do everybody's jobs.<br />
<font color="red">But Their job was just to establish your dharma. They came at that time in those places where it was needed the most.<br />
So, these Ten Principles, as I told you, They established [dharma].</font><br /> 
<font color="red">They are created in the Void.</font><br />
As you see here the Void part, this part is made out of the water element. <font color="red">So, whatever miracles They did, had something to do with water, like They could create water anywhere They wanted to. They would not cure people. All of Them have created water in the desert or in the places where ... like in ... Nāṇaka has created a Pan̄jā Sāhab they call it, or everywhere They have been able to create water. Whatever They touched, They could create water out of it.</font><br />
Water is the life, life force which sustains us. Without water we cannot live! The is the sustainance [sustenance].<br />
<font color="red">But, They actually are symbolized in an ocean, in the ocean, because They give us the salt, the salt of life, which gives us the sustainance [sustenance].</font> If you see the salt, if we do not have salt in our body, we'll have no sustainance [sustenance]."<br />

"Now when I'm talking to you about the mechanism that is built within us for our last breakthrough, you need not believe Me. <br />
In our country also, this knowledge was kept a secret for thousands of years. Though we can say people like Mārkaṇḍeya, whose dates could be fourteen thousand [years ago], or later on, up to Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, people did write about the Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
And at the time of Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, He very clearly talked about it. That was the tradition of evolution described in all these great Scriptures.<br />
Even in the Bible, you find the Tree of Fire. It says: "I will appear before you as tongues of flames." <br />
Even Muhammad Sāhab, who came much later, very clearly, very, very clearly, and elaborately, at length, talked about the Resurrection Day. He said: "At the Time of Resurrection, your hands will speak."<br />
But everybody missed the point.<br />
Zoroaster talked about it thousands of years back. <font color="red">Confucius, Lao Tze, everyone talked about it: that, 'We have to be the Spirit.'</font><br />
Christ clearly said: "You are to be born-again!" Then Nicodemus asked Him: "Do you mean to say, I should enter into the womb of my mother?" "No," He said, "whatever is born of the flesh is the flesh. You are to be born of the Holy Ghost." "<br />

"The Primordial Master was also born as Macchindranāth, and again as Zoroaster who was worshiped by the ancient Persians, and still revered by Parsis. Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism. <font color="red">In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates.</font> He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā). Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918. Altogether there were ten major Avatāras of Dattātreya."<br />

"Religious fundamentalism and fanaticism have already become a threat to World Peace. We had a discussion with some religious people in Italy and they refused to accept a religion which was global. They wanted to have exclusive religions. In this way they promote conflict between the followers of one religion and those of another. They believe that killing others in the name of religion is their duty. On the other hand all the great philosophers, Incarnations, Prophets and Sufis have never talked about any exclusive religion. <font color="red">Confucius first talked about humanity, but then came Tao of Lao Tze who tried to bring the subtle side of humanity. This Tao is something like the Kuṇḍalinī of Sahaja Yoga. I have traveled through the Yangtze River. This voyage on a boat gave me a unique experience and enabled me to understand Lao Tze very well. This river is a very dangerous one in the beginning for boats to pass through. There are lots of currents which flow in different directions. But along the side of this river there are beautiful manifestations of nature. The very steep, rising mountains that we see in the paintings of the Chinese are all to be seen there with rivers flowing between them. It is very beautiful to see the bank of the Yangtze River. As Lao Tze had said: "It may be very beautiful and attractive outside, but you should keep your mind inside and ply through the Yangtze River". This is very significant, but how many understand what He has said? How many have tried to follow Him? In China many people do not seem to care much for Lao Tze and His Tao, but there will come a time when they will realize that that is the subtle side of humanity.</font>"<br />

There was an age when no one was willing to accept a woman as a Guru but in Kali Yuga only Mother could do His work: it is beyond the power of men.</font><br />
This work could not be done by force, only the love of a Mother could do it because already there is so much pressure, tension in this world. The day it is forced upon the human being they will break down. So, love is the only way out.<br />
So this Gurudom was given to Me. Everything is acceptable to Me.<br />

Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa had only one Son who was Praṇava incarnate. Think of it, He was Auṃ incarnate. He incarnated on this Earth. His name was Jesus Christ. Mary was His Mother. He was placed on the Āgñyā chakra.<br />
On Āgñyā one has to face ego and superego. You see your Āgñyā chakra controls your pineal (śhaṅku granthi) and pituitary body (pīyūṣh granthi), it is scientifically proved.<br />
So He pushes away the evil spirits from your Āgñyā because these spirits sit on superego. They could sit in ego also because Iḍā and Piṅgalā cross each other on Āgñyā chakra.<br />
So Lord Jesus put His hand on this plexus first of all.<br />
<font color="red">It was done at the time of Nāṇak Sāheb.</font><br />
In all ages these ghostly powers came to do encroachment. But Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa has such a destructive power that He cut their throats.<br />
So on Āgñyā chakra is the name of Lord Jesus."<br />

"But before reaching the Heart chakra, the gap I showed you, is all the Bhavasāgara. In the center is the seat of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, and on it Śhrī Brahmadeva creates the whole universe. He made this Bhavasāgara.<br />
After creating the Bhavasāgara, the question was, 'How to cross it over? The human being was created, but how to make him realize it? How to make human beings recognize it? In him, how to activate the Brahma Tattwa?' Meaning, 'How to get the Union of Śhiva and Śhakti within him? How would the connection be established?'<br />
For this, a special personality was created in this world. This was created by the combined essence of Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, and Maheśh, who we acknowledge as Śhrī Dattātreya. Śhrī Dattātreya is none other than Ādi Guru.<br />
He is My Guru. He has mentored Me all His past lives.<br />
If you hear about His birth and all His previous lives you would be amazed. We have forgotten such a great thing.<br />
Śhrī Dattātreya's Incarnations are numerous. Firstly He came as King Janaka. Śhrī Sītājī was His daughter, who was the embodiment of Śhakti Herself. Then He came as Macchindranāth, Zoroaster, and Muhammad Sāhab, who were a completely different type of human being.<br />
They trialed out lots of different things.<br /> 
Śhrī Datta, the Primordial Masters firstly in this world educated us about the symbolic forms within us. And then also said that, "You people got entangled in symbolism, in idol worshiping." Their meaning was to go beyond and recognize the Śhakti within these idols. That's why They talked about the idols.<br />
<font color="red">For example, there is a flower, and to describe the honey within the flower, They talked about the flower first, from which the people would taste the honey. But people got stuck to flower. So Then they took Incarnations and talked about the honey.<br />
In that, They talked about God in the abstract. They deliberately didn't talk about the reincarnation of life.</font><br />
Because as soon as you talk about past lives, people ask Me, "Mātājī, tell me about my past lives." The life that has passed, why do you want to know that? Whether you were a king or a pauper, what difference it will make?<br />
That's why They did not discuss past lives.<br />
Muhammad Sāhab was the same, Dattātreya's Incarnation, and the same Incarnation was King Janaka. <font color="red">The same Incarnation was Nāṇaka, whose sister Nāṇakī, was the same Ādi Śhakti. She was Sītājī."</font><br />

"The same Śhrī Dattā incarnated many a times on the Earth.<br />
As I told you yesterday, King Janaka was one of Them. King Janaka was the father of Jānakī [Śhrī Sītā]. He was none other than the Incarnation of Śhrī Dattātreya.<br />
Thereafter, Macchindranāth, most have you must have heard His name, was also His Incarnation.<br />
After that Zoroaster who came three times on the Earth, He was also His Incarnation.<br />
After that Muhammad Sāhab, who was His Incarnation.<br />
And when He was asked that, "Bhāī [Brother], there must have been others also before You," then He replied, "Yes, there [was] a Muhammad." Then again He was asked who was before Him. He replied, "There was one Muhammad."<br />
Muhammad means Praise, the One who is praised, the One who deserves to be praised and is the One who is Redeemer of the world.<br /> 
They were all Muhammads, They were all Dattātreyas, who came on Earth regularly.<br />
<font color="red">After that [was] Nāṇaka, Guru Nāṇaka. If you ever read His teachings, if you read His talks then you will be surprised that He has always talked in a Sahaja. He has said, "Sahaja Samādhi lago." He has said, "Kāhe re ban khojan jāe, Sarab nivāsī sadā alepā tohī saṃg[a] samāī, Puṣhpamadhya jo bāsa basata hai mukara māhī jaise chhāī, Taise hī harī base niraṃtara ghaṭa hī khojo bhāī." ["Why to go to forest to find Him, He is always there with you just like there is a fragrance in a flower and just as the reflection is there in a mirror, in the same way God is residing in you eternally, seek Him within."] He is just inside, achieve Him just inside. We are just singing poem, singing songs, we are just cramming His prescription.</font><br />
The talk of seeking this Absolute Principle, residing just inside the heart, has been made since ancient times by these Ādi Gurus, who are incarnated on this Earth again and again.<br />
......<br />
<font color="red">After Nāṇak Sāhab, around fifty, sixty years ago in our Maharashtra Dattātreya incarnated as Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī.</font> If you want proof of it, then you get your Realization and after that if you put your hand on anyone, then you will get vibration of same kind: from just vibration only you can know about all."<br />

"<font color="red">And those who are fighting amongst themselves, they should also know: for whom they are fighting among themselves, are the same. Like for Muhammad Sāhib and Guru Nāṇak. Muhammad Sāhib and Guru Nāṇak was the same person. They had one identity.<br />
From the life of Nāṇakjī, I will tell you, once He was lying down. People asked Him, "Why are You lying down with Your Feet towards Mecca, where there is Kaaba?" He said, "OK, I turn My Feet, Kaaba has tuned."<br />
What is Kaaba? It is dust from Muhammad Sāhib's Feet and the same is of Nāṇak Sāhib also. Both are the same person and I will introduce Them in Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
When someone gets cancer, he can be cured by either Nāṇak Sāhib or Muhammad Sāhib, no one else.</font> Because what we call Void, is known to doctors, we call it Bhavasāgar, Dattātreya, who is Ādi Guru, who helps us in crossing Bhavasāgar, where all Gurus are present, unless you take the name of one of Them, you are not going to be free from problems of Bhavasāgar, which manifests as cancer. You can recognize cancer from the throb here. You cannot be cured.<br />
I want to ask, 'How many Muslims are here and how many Sikhs?'<br />
One thing, Muhammad Sāhib has prohibited the drinking of alcohol. He said, "Don't touch alcohol." He did not say anything. He was murdered. I know to what state He was reduced to.<br />
Sometimes at the mosque there will be fights over small leftovers.<br />
And I want to ask those Muslims who drink and remind them about Muhammad Sāhib. They won't like it and they definitely will drink alcohol. Not only that, [but] they wrote poetry on alcohol. For them alcohol is God."<br />

Find out that center which He has said. What are we singing about? Have we done any justice to our Guru? Have we done any justice to our Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya? Have we done any justice to Christ or to Muhammad Sāhib? We have not. We are doing just the opposite of what They have told us.<br />
Muslims are very fanatic people.<br />
I would say Muhammad Sāhib was the least fanatic personality.<br />

"Now the ... these three aspects, the essence of these aspects, or we can say the innocence of these three aspects, is combined in the Primord[i]al Guru, or the Ādi Guru Dattātreya, who resides in the Bhavasāgara and helps Śhrī Viṣhṇu for your evolution.<br />
Now He has taken many Incarnations, mainly Ten Incarnations. And these are very important, and we have to understand Them in Their full entirety.<br />
If you accept Him as Dattātreya, you have to also accept Him as Rāja Janaka.<br />
It's easy for a Hindu mind to accept Rāja Janaka, but they cannot accept Muhammad Sāhab, who was same as Rāja Janaka. It is a fact which can ... we can prove it on your Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
A person who is suffering from cancer of the stomach -- now this is the thing, when I say that Sahaja Yoga can cure your cancer, you have to give up certain notions that we have in our hear... head.<br />
A person, eh supposing he's a Hindu, and he's suffering from the stomach cancer, I have to ask him to take the name of Muhammad Sāhab. If I fail to ask him or if I convince ... do not him ... convince Him, I cannot cure his can't ... cancer. I'm sorry, I tell him, 'I just cannot do it.' But if he is a Muslim, I have to tell him: 'You have to take the name of Dattātreya.'<br />
Human beings, like fools, have taken away the living flowers of one tree, and now are fighting on something that is dead.<br />
He was Dattātreya. There is no doubt about it.<br />
And His daughter Fāṭimah was nobody else but Sītā Jānakī Herself.<br />
And Her two sons, Hasan and Husayn, were nobody else but Lava and Kuśha. They were born again and again: They were born as Mahāvīra and Buddha, and then They were born as Hasan and Husayn.<br />
It is only possible through Sahaja Yoga to realize that this is the Truth, this is the fact.<br />
<font color="red">He was born as Nāṇaka.</font> And Nāṇakī was nobody else but Jānakī.<br />
<font color="red">In Nāṇaka's life He has expressed it. Of course I don't know how many people have read about Nāṇak.<br />
Nāṇaka one day was sleeping, and His Feet were towards Kaaba. And people were getting vibrations from that side, so they said: "What are You doing your? Your Feet are towards Kaaba!" So He said, "All right, I'll turn My Feet's on the other side." And they started getting vibrations from the other side. They said, "What? Kaaba has moved or what?"<br />
He has, in a way, showed.</font><br />
'But how dare They say many things?' When They said very few thing[s], they have killed all these people and tortured Them.<br />
If you read Muhammad Sāhab['s] life, you will feel, 'What foolish people we have been, the way we have tortured [Him]!'<br />
For fanaticism the way He was killed!<br />
Actually was poisoned. He had no place where to hide His head the way people were after Him, because He was telling the Truth.<br />
And fanaticism is one thing He fought.<br />
So, Guru Tattwa is killed as soon as you become a fanatic person. Your Guru Tattwa is immediately finished, as soon as you take to fanaticism of any kind!"<br />

......<br />
Another thing is, here in Bhavasāgar, all Three, Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, Maheśhwar, combined to make a child, who is called Ādi Guru, is known as Dattātreya. There were many Incarnations of Him. And His Child Tattwa also took Incarnations. First was Dattātreya, then came Rāja Janak. <font color="red">Like this, many Incarnations came, Rāja Janak, Nāṇak, Zarathustra, Muhammad Sāhab, Sāī Nāth of Śhirḍī.<br />
They are all one. Are They or not? You can witness it after Self-realization. If you believe in one Guru, like Nāṇak, then you have no right not to accept Muhammad Sāhab. If you get Muhammad Sāhab and not Nāṇak, then you have no authority as well.</font><br />
You will be surprised, most of the cancer disease comes from the imbalance of Bhavasāgar, you follow one but not the other. Cancer also comes when we don't follow Them.<br />
Like He forbade two things, like not to smoke a cigarette and not to consume alcohol.<br />
Alcohol is entirely not allowed. Here, in Sahaja Yoga, if someone is habituated to drink alcohol, they will leave it. If they don't leave alcohol, it will [not] be in moderation because both of these things go against Guru Tattwa.<br />
If Guru Tattwa is not established within us, we cannot have our evolution. Guru Tattwa is essential. Guru Tattwa is one destiny for all religions. There is one flow from all the religions."<br />

"Now, this Guru was created when the world was created itself. Because we ... one had to create a Guru before the world was created in then Vaikuṇṭha Stage only.<br />
But then He reincarnated many a times.<br />
At the time of Rāma, very early, even before Rāma came into this world, much earlier than that, He was created by Satī Anusūyā. She was Herself a part of the Ādi Śhakti, who created Him out of the essences, the innocence of Brahmā, Viṣhṇu and Maheśh.<br />
There's a legend about it which I will tell you sometime.<br />
And She created Him. Actually, She created Him, so She's the Mother.<br />
But then, She becomes the Guru.<br />
When She is born as Sītā, He becomes the father. So, She ... father is Her Guru.<br />
Then, when Rāja Janaka is born as Muhammad Sāhab, then She becomes again the daughter.<br />
<font color="red">But when He is born as Nāṇaka, then He becomes the ... She becomes His sister.</font><br />
So the relationship exists and whenever He is born, She is born, in a way, that, you see, that relationship is kept a sublime relationship. I mean to say: that they are never born as husband and wife."<br />

"I have told you about Nābhī chakra and also about Void. The Guru Principle resides in this Bhavasāgara [Void] and this Guru Principle establishes the dharma within us. These ten petals here that we have shown are the ones which establishes the Ten Dharmas within us.<br />
It is important to have these Ten Dharmas in a human being otherwise he is not a human being. Even if he has has nine dharmas in him is still [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] a bit and if he does not follow these dharmas that are within him, and when I say dharma I don't mean by Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and all that, but dharma means the Innate Dharma of humanity within, if one does not keep to those Ten Dharmas, then he turns into a demon [devil].<br />
<font color="red">This Guru Principle (Tattwa) has taken birth in this world in many forms especially it has these Ten Main Incarnations have taken birth like Rāja Janaka, Nāṇak, Muhammad Sāhab, etc. and at the end it was Sāī Nāth from Śhirḍī, who took birth. They tie this Tattwa [Principle] within us because all these Gurus who have taken birth for our evolution are placed within us.</font><br />
[<font color="orange">unclear</font>] these Gurus are very subtly placed Deities within us.<br />
Like for these Guru already say, "Don't consume alcohol," then They weren't mad that They said this. Neither They were standing in any elections to win votes that They said that. You can't even say that They had any kind of business that in some competitive feeling He said that thing.<br />
They said, "Child, don't drink alcohol, don't take to cigarettes, don't take any kind of drugs," because the position of our attention within is also placed in the area of Void.<br />
You will be surprised to know that our attention is in our stomach. Actually, to be specific, in liver resides our attention.<br />
They said, "You don't drink alcohol," so your attention does not get spoiled. You know by drinking human awareness gets damaged.<br />
People got the other way by saying, 'OK, if drinking is not allowed then let's not garlic, onions, etc.' <font color="red">Prophet Muhammad used to eat garlic, onions and also Nāṇaka used to eat meat and all that.</font>"<br />

But then he was very much worse.<br />
Then he came to Me. I said, "Now take the name of Dattātreya." You won't believe: he sat down, he said, "Mother, teach me how to do Pūjā of Dattātreya." And he got much better. I must say!<br />
There was another gentleman who was a staunch Hindu. And if they are staunch, they are the worst they can take up. [Laughter.] And I told him that he has to take the name of Muhammad. And he would not! He said, "You are finishing my religion in, what are you doing‽ You are blasphemous!" And all kind of things he said. I said, "All right. You can say whatever you like."<br />

"It is surprising that there is a gentleman in Rangoon who is an Avadhūta. Not only in India, but they can be found all around the world. Prophet Muhammad was an Avadhūta. <font color="red">King Janaka was an Avadhūta, so was Nāṇak.</font><br />
Many of them [Avadhūtas] did a lot of work in this Maharashtra. It is only because of their work here did I take My birth in this place.<br />
Sāī Nāth was the last of them from Maharashtra.<br />
Their work establishes the dharma. Or more like the dharma settles down in that place. They take their form on this earth only to fulfill that goal.<br />
When the human loses his faith in dharma, 'Why should I do this?', when he starts thinking this ways, then the Avadhūtas take birth on this Earth. And wherever they may be, in forests or mountains, dead or alive, all they do is keep working on giving you the validations of dharma.<br />
If you tell lies and start suffering from its consequences, then realize that there is some Avadhūta, sitting on some mountain in the Himalayas, who is responsible for whatever is happening to you. He is the one putting you all right.<br />
......<br />
<font color="red">The dharma in humans has at least ten aspects of discipline to it that should be followed, and all Gurus have emphasized that this needs to happen. They could be in the form of Muhammad, Nāṇak or Janak.</font><br />

But the concepts of dharma, as this world knows it today, are so complicated and twisted, "I don't drink, I don't even consume garlic." "Is it so? OK, you don't drink, you don't eat garlic, onions, etc., you don't do anything, granted. Then why is your Void catching?" Void meaning where Dattā [Śhrī Dattātreya] resides, in the stomach.

Say, we keep a Photograph of Sāī Nāth in our home, who was He? Wasn't He a Muslim? Be truthful.<br />

"About Me also you can ask questions. There are many ways of recognizing because in this life, you have to recognize. You have never recognized an Incarnation so far. You have to recognize.<br />
That is compulsory and that is done through Sahajs Yoga because unless and until you are realized, how are going to recognize Them also?<br />
But even if you have not recognized Them, there was no need for you to crucify Them or to torture.<br />
<font color="red">Then all the Gurus who came on this Earth, the Real Ones -- fakes are never gurus, they are not gurus -- the Real Ones that came on this Earth, say, we can say Moses, Abraham, Nāṇak, Muhammad Sāhib, Kabīr, all these are Incarnations of Primordial Master whom we call as Dattātreya.</font><br />
<font color="red">If They are or not, if Muhammad Sāhib and Guru Nāṇak are the same personality, same people who came in different times, then what justice are we doing to Them?</font> How are we to find out? How are you to believe Me about it?<br />
I will give you an example. There was a Muslim gentleman from Iran who came to see Me, who was suffering from cancer. He asked Me: "Mother, I want to get cured." I said, "You['re] a Muslim?", he said, "Yes, I only believe in Muhammad Sāhib and nobody else!" I said, "This would be something like that, 'I only believe in my nose, and not in anything else.' "<br />
He was such a fanatic and fanaticism brings about the cancer of Nābhī chakra as we call it, the stomach. You will be amazed fanaticism is sin, sinful. It gives you the cancer of stomach.<br />
<font color="red">I asked him, "Will you worship Nāṇak Sāhib?" He said, "No, why should I? I am a Muslim." I said, "Do you know Muhammad Sāhib Himself is angry with you and you have to worship Nāṇak?"<br />
He would not but it happened for months and then he had to accept.</font><br />
Any extreme behavior of this kind is prohibited in all the religions.<br />
<font color="red">When Nāṇak came or when even our Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth came, They talked about sadāchār.</font> Even the Goddess's name is Sadāchār Pravartakā [Founder/Source of Good Conduct].<br /> 
Sadāchār is the most important thing. The dhana [treasure] is the most important thing. One has to be in dharma. If you are adharmī, how do you expect Me to give you Realization, you just tell Me?<br />
<font color="red">Today I went to see a tailor of Mine who was saying, "Mother, if I am bad You tell me but why should not I get Realization?" I said, "True, why should not you? All right ask a question, 'Mother, are you Nāṇak?' " He asked Me the question. Normally the vibrations start but would not. He said, "What has happened to me?" I said, "See where is your Surati?"</font><br />
<font color="red">Nāṇak has described Kuṇḍalinī as Surati.</font><br />
His Kuṇḍalinī was pulsating at Nābhī. You could see with your naked eye. His friend or his proprietor was also seeing that. It was pulsating there.<br />
<font color="red">I said, "You have a liver. Do you drink?" He said, "I drink quite a lot." Then I said, "How do you expect Me to give you Realization in the name of Nāṇak who has prohibited all this?"</font><br />
When I say this people brand Me as anything.<br />
......<br />
Kuṇḍalinī knowledge is very much known to us.<br />
Actually we are so much anglicized, thanks to Lord [Thomas Babington] Macaulay, that a very few people who even know the word Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
If you read Kabīr, the whole thing, Kabīr is nothing but Sahaja Yoga.<br />
How many of you read Kabīr? For fashion sake even if they read they don't know what He is talking about.<br />
<font color="red">Nāṇak has talked about it, Gyāneśhwara has talked about it.</font><br />
Christ has talked about it that, "I will appear before you like tongues of flames." What is the meaning? Christians do not know about it.<br />
So it is being promised."<br />

"So, if you think evolution is a religion, then I would say Sahaja Yoga is the religion. If your evolution if you call it as a religion, then Sahaja Yoga is a religion. But is a religion which takes you belo ... beyond your sustenance, beyond your religion, dharmātīt, beyond the dharma.<br />
We have amongst ourselves Hindu[s], Muslims, Christians, all kinds of people, you know that. All these people can feel it within themselves: is the religion in their stomachs, they can feel it. They can find out where is the religion. Because, I say, there, religion in the stomach is looked after by the Deities of Primordial Master whom we call as Dattātreya, in the Sanskrit language.<br />
But does't mean Hinduism. It doesn't mean Hinduism at all. But it is called as Dattātreya in the Sanskrit language, in English is Primordial Master.<br />
<font color="red">He is the same who incarnated on this earth: as Moses, as Abraham, and, say, incarnated as Muhammad Sāhab, as Rāja Janaka, as Nāṇaka, and also as Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth. Can you believe that Muhammad Sāhab is the same as our Nāṇak?</font><br />
Now in the religion of these people, the Muslims, so-called, and the so-called Sikhs, are fighting amongst themselves.<br />
Can you believe that Mahāvīra and Buddha were the same as Hasan and Husayn? Which we can prove it to you on suh ... on vibrations and on curing people. They were the same people reincarnated just to improve on Themselves. Because people believe into something which They were not, so They were incarnated just to show: that, 'This was wrong. No, no, this was, I never said it! This was the thing.'<br />
<font color="red">In the story of ah ... Nāṇaka, it was said that once He was sleeping, so they said, "What? You are preaching that there should be unity among Hindus and Muslims, and You are putting Your Feet towards the Mecca!" He said, "Really?" Then He turned His Feet on the other side. He said, "Mecca has moved!"<br />
He was the religion, but not His followers. They drink, He allowed them to drink, did He?</font> When Muhammad Sāhab said, "Don't drink," that means they make a fanatic thing out of all that."<br />

"But still, as you can see in the life of Christ, that coming of Christ was declared much before Christ came in by the Prophets who made prophecies. All these Prophets belong to the category of the Gurus I am talking about.<br />
So, all over the world three types of movements were on. For example, the scientist[s] on the right-hand side, we can say, and the left-hand side are the devotees of God who sing the praise of God. And in the center there were people like Moses, like Abraham, who came on this earth just to prophesize, just to protect the devotees of God.<br />
Now this middle movement of evolution, today, has reached its peak. Because all the Incarnations have arrived now, and have done Their job within you. They have occupied Their position within you, in your awareness, on these different centers. <br />
......<br />
So today we are here to know that within us all these Incarnations exist, and the force that really brought forth, really manifested, who live like human beings and work like Gurus, that force which existed in this area, which created religion within us.<br />
Religion, as we understand, organized religion, is not the religion. But the religion means: your sustaining power. You are a human being because there are ten sustaining powers within you.<br />
So, They came to sustain us and to give us full idea about these Ten Powers and to establish us in our religion as a human being.<br />
So these Gurus, who lived in that area, worked out the sustainace [sustenance] and helped us.<br />
And this is one of the greatest forces we have got, which resides within us.<br />
And whatever They have said has a very great meaning.<br />
Actually, we should say the Main Gurus are ten, but there are many other Gurus.<br />
And these Ten Gurus could be described as Rāja Janaka, then Moses, Abraham, and the in modern times you can say Muhammad Sāhab, and even up to Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth, in Śhirḍī, that force came in, for a short time, and then He disappeared. Nobody knows how He came there, He lived there and He died. <font color="red">Also, if you know Nāṇaka, He was also the same force, the same Primordial Master, who was born on this Earth.</font><br />
Now, this is not the time to tell about individual people. But, I think, one day I will talk to you only on this subject of the Gurus.<br />
So, these Gurus first started under the Primordial Master Himself, He was called as Dattātreya.
......<br />
There's one more point I would like to tell you, that they have not yet gone here, but here [], there are the two uh more small uh-uh-uh chakras: one that belongs to, uh uh which we call as the Sūrya -- Sūrya is the-uh-uh uh uh, means the Sun, the Sun center -- and the another as the Moon center on the left-hand side. And these two are uh governed or, we can say, is uh bestowed upon by two great uh-uh-uh people, who are the Disciple Elements.<br />
And They, disciple elements were first, were born to Śhrī Rāma and Śhrī Sītā as the-ee Lav and Kuśh. And then They incarnated many a times on this Earth as disciple. One of Them is, we can say, ah ... was uh Śhaṅkarāchārya, another was Kabīra, uh like that. Then, we can say, later on, uh like, uh before Śhaṅkarāchārya, they came as Buddha and Mahāvīra. Then Śhaṅkarāchārya, and then, uh I told you, which is? Uh after Śhaṅkarāchārya came ... the Advent of Hasan and Husayn, who were the grandsons of Prophet.<br />
So these have been incarnating, and they have been moving from one uh-uh-uh side to another and telling people that, "This is extreme, leave it." "This is the extreme, leave it. Come in the center, and be in the center." That has been Their job. And they are the ones who are, sort of, imparting you that awareness by you become a perfect disciple.<br />
And the ... this is a very important point because it comes, quite often, that uh-uh-uh we do not understand.<br />
Like Prophet Muhammad said that: "I am the last Prophet." All right, He did say He was the last Prophet.<br />
Supposing I say, I am the last person to come here. All right I would say just to frighten you that, 'h-oh, you better take to it otherwise this is the last time I am telling you!' [Laughs.]<br />
But it is never that!<br />
Because when He wa... died He found out: that, you see, these people are madcaps. 'I didn't tell them this, what are they doing out of Me?' So, He said, 'I better go back again.'<br />
<font color="red">And He came as Nāṇaka. And He told them, that: "Hindu and Muslims are same people, following the same religion, why are you fighting among yourselves?" See, They came for that unity.<br />
Then as Nāṇaka He came. So, in Nāṇaka's system also the Sikhism came in and they started a warrior class and this and that. I mean imagine, the Sikhism ended up by having wars within Muslims and Hindus.</font><br />
<font color="red">So, then He came as Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth to teach them.</font><br />
Now, this is not a very important thing that, say Muhammad Sāhab said, "I am the last." Say He is the last, all right, even take that position. Who are you to Him? How are you related? Through what? What is your authority? How do you appropriate Him to yourself? Because you say you are Muslims, so what? How did you become Muslims? Did you get your certificate from God?"<br />

"Now when They said, "Don't drink," you say, 'Oh-oh, that's out-of-dated. You see, there's Muhammad Sāhab, was no good. He told us not to drink.' <font color="red">Nāṇaka said, "Don't drink."</font><br />
Now, smoking, you see the results of smoking, now what's happening with smoking. It goes against uh uh your Viśhuddhi. Because, you see, that is the place of Kṛiṣhṇa, and smoking started much later. You see, when He was much earlier, smoking started later on.<br />
<font color="red">That's why Nāṇak Sāhab has talked about it much more.</font><br />
But uh Muhammad Sāhab did see this point, He did see. So He said, "All ... all the inter... intoxicants and all habits are to be discarded. All such things must be discarded." So, He also wanted mhh yeah ...<br />
...... [Conversation to identify the English word addiction.]<br />
All these addictions must be given up. He said it, very clearly: "No addictions are allowed," according to Him.<br />
But you see, how you make uh-uh-uh uh-uh fuss about things.<br />
Like Muhammad Sāhab and all these Gurus, all these Great Incarnations of the Primordial Master who was Ādi Dattātreya, Ādinātha [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], They taught you how to maintain your religion, your sustainance [sustenance], your balance.<br />
So, immediately the Christians. Because Christ didn't talk much about it because Moses had talked about it, Abraham had talked about it. So Christ did not talk, so they said, "All right. So Christians can drink." Just imagine.<br />
This is a loophole.<br />
That's how they became Christians perhaps. Because they thought that if ... uh they were belonged to the Jews, you see, then they would have ... uh they wouldn't be able to drink.<br />
But Jews drink like Hell. Jews also drink now! I mean the Muslims drink the most, you see.<br />
And worst are the Sikhs: who are prohibited from drinking and smoking, they can beat all your scotch people here, you see. All your scotch whiskey goes into their stomachs [laughter], all these things, and they grow in this, this  beard, thinking that they are great Sikhs going around, you see."<br />

"Around that, is that area where actually it exists in the stomach of God, we can say, this is the Bhavasāgara. This is what we have to cross. You see there's a Void, from there to there is a Void, and this we have to cross. And this is the thing which is crossed by the Kuṇḍalinī awakening.<br />
<font color="red">Now what happens? That around that uh ... that ... water-like thing that you see there, see that is the one where Ten ... the Primordial Masters were born, Gurus, Primordial Gurus. Now They were incarnated of innocence of all this three aspects. And They were incarnated on this Earth, say, from Abraham, Moses, then we had uh-uh-uh ... up to Muhammad Sāhab we can say, then we can say Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth, then Nāṇaka, Janaka, all these people incarnated as Gurus.</font><br />
Now what do They do? They, They, They give you sustainance [sustenance]. They give you sustainance [sustenance].<br />
Now, sustenance is ... is ... for human beings is different. For animals is different.<br />
......<br />
And this sustenance is maintained by the Gurus in that area. And They look after us: They are born again and again, again and again, to tell us about it.<br />
<font color="red">They, people might say, 'What's wrong in drink?' Why did Muhammad Sāhab say, "Do not drink," Nāṇak Sāhab said, Moses said, that, "You should not drink?" For why [They] did this?</font><br />
Now there is a reason, which you cannot stop it. If I tell you, 'Don't drink,' you come and drink.<br />
I'll give you [a] very good reason for that, absolutely scientific, absolutely scientific. But you won't stop. So what should I do?<br />
You see, which is the other way is: 'Why do you drink?' First of all I should find out the reason for it.<br />
I find out the reason: that because you get bored, that's why. So, because you do not want to face the reality, you have an escape."<br />

"For example you cannot sprout a seed, it sprouts by itself.<br />
In the same way, you cannot make this force pulsate here in the back.<br />
For example, you may stand up and dance, you may left your le... legs, you can stand on your heads, you can do whatever you please. But you cannot make something pulsate there.<br />
That is the divine, spontaneous force of God's Love.<br />
You can see with your naked eyes. You can also see the rising of that force on your back. In various people, here there are at least seventy percent [70\%] people who have seen. It rises within you, touching all these subtle centers, which are manifesting your plexuses outside, which are gross in nature. And you can see it pulsating here on your head.<br />
<font color="red">As Nāṇaka has said, or Kabīra has said it: "Śhūnya śhikhara par anāhata baje re."</font><br />
Anāhata: there is a sound without percussion you can feel it, 'Lub-dub, lub-dub,' here. Here you can feel it, and that is the Baptism.<br />
Where the Kuṇḍalinī rises -- this force is called as Kuṇḍalinī -- through all these various centers, and opens this out, and you become -- it's an actualization -- you become a person who is a self-realized person."<br />

"All this has to be integrated. All the great religions which have been propounded in the growth of human beings, which have substantially helped in the growth of human beings, which are the substratum of their living, has to be integrated in that happening.<br />
For example, I meet, supposing, a Hindu, then he says, "Mother, how do You talk of Christ? We don't believe in Christ." Now you are a very, very great person not to believe in Christ. Who are you not to believe in Christ? What do you think of yourself? What do you mean by saying that you don't believe in Christ?

Now, I have come and people are accepting Śhrī Sāī Nāth.<br />
But when He lived here, He did not even get anything to eat. Why was it so? He was also a human being. As long as He was alive, He too was considered useless and tortured. But when He died, He was regarded as Bhagavān.<br />

You will have water of the Ganges, where She flows. If She is flowing here, will you say, 'We do not accept Her as the Ganges!'? There may be nothing at the place where She was flowing earlier, or maybe only a nullah [ravine] at present. If you want to take it as the Ganges, you go your way. If the Ganges is flowing at this place, why not accept it?<br />
It is not easy to understand human intellect. It is the most difficult job in the world! It is easy to understand God, because He is what He is. He does not have such double dealings. Man has a variety of qualities, not just double. All animals from snakes and scorpions to elephants, horses and lions are residing in him. You will not understand at all, why his brain is working in this way.<br />
Now when the Ganges is flowing why don't you take water from Her?<br />
Imagine this plug has been connected here. Will you connect in its place a plug which is out of order? It is quite pragmatic.<br />
I cannot understand what hallucination is there on human intellect, that he does not accept the Truth which he is seeing but accepts something that is not seen?
Its reason was understood long back and that is ahaṅkār [ego]. Man has too much of ego.<br />
If you had accepted Śhrī Rāma in His days, He would have told you to get your Kuṇḍalinī awakened and get the Realization and get established in Sahaja Yoga.<br />
Had you recognized Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, He would not have played Sahaja Yoga in Gokul, but would have given you the Realization and told you to practice Sahaja Yoga.<br />
<font color="red">If Śhrī Nāṇak had been accepted, there was no need for Him to break His head telling you to do different things. He would have simply taught Sahaja Yoga, but very few understood Him in His days.<br />
Now, when He is not here, you have built gurudwārās in His name.</font><br />
When Muhammad is not here mosques have been made, because they think now Muhammad Sāhib is in their hands.<br />
Now Rāma is in their hands, and they can make His temple and say, 'His is our temple, this Rāma is our property. We have authority over Him and whatever you have brought, all money and other things, offer them to this idol.'<br />
You say all this because you think you are the authority of this idol. It is sheer ego because of which man thinks, that he can keep God in his control and for that he is making all the show. Every time the same show was repeated."<br />

"People crucified Jesus Christ because of their ego. They could not conceive of an idea that some human being can appear on the Earth as an Incarnation of God. Their intellectual pride could not accept this idea and they rejected the Truth because of the ego.<br />
What was the bad deed for which Jesus was crucified? He had on the contrary cured many people of their ailments. He preached the Truth and taught many good things to the people. He showed them the way to live a very cultured life. He always preached Love.<br />
In spite of this, the people tortured Him. But they would bow before those who teach filthy and rotten things and make a fool of them. What a height of stupidity!<br />
These days any Tom, Dick or Harry becomes a guru, robs the people, squeezes money from them. Such persons are held in high esteem.<br />
On the contrary, if a good person, who stands by the Truth, wishes to show the true path, the people not only won't listen to him but assault him.<br />
To educate such very stupid people God Almighty sent His beloved Son, Jesus Christ, on this Earth. But the people crucified Him.<br />
They have been, ever since, repeatedly doing the same thing. If you read, you will find that whenever God incarnated, or any Sage or Saint took birth on this Earth, the people have harmed them and tortured them. Instead of learning from them, they behaved with them stupidly. We will notice the same story about Śhrī Gyāneśhwara and Śhrī Tukārāma, the great Saints of Maharashtra. <font color="red">Similar treatment was meted out to Śhrī Guru Nāṇaka and Prophet Muhammad.</font><br />
Man always runs away from the Truth and tries to embrace the untruth.<br />
......<br />  
When we study the life of Jesus Christ, one thing is noticed prominently. That is the stupidity of the people of that time. Because of that stupidity this magnificent personality was crucified. And what height of stupidity! When the people were asked to express their opinion as to whether a thief or Jesus be released, the Jews demanded that the thief be released and Jesus Christ crucified.<br />
We know the state of these people today! The sin committed by them will not be washed away in many, many lives. And even now these persons are enveloped in their ego. They think that they have done a virtuous deed.<br /> 
Even now, if these people seek pardon of God, saying that, 'Oh God, pardon us for crucifying your sacred principle. Forgive us for destroying your sacred principle,' God will immediately forgive them.<br /> 
But man finds it very difficult to apologize. He commits a number of evil deeds.<br /> 
How many persons can be found in the world who have worshiped the Saints?<br /> 
<font color="red">Take the instance of Śhrī Kabīr or Śhrī Guru Nāṇaka. The people have persecuted Them at every step.</font><br /> 
In this world the people have not given anything to the Saints except harm and torture.<br /> 
But I tell you now, that circumstances have changed. The Satya Yoga has commenced. You may try, but now you would not succeed in persecuting or torturing any Saint.<br /> 
This is due to Jesus Christ Himself. For Jesus Christ has set in motion a mighty power in this world which would make such wicked people suffer. They would be punished. The Ekādeśha Rudras of Jesus Christ are all in readiness to strike. Those who would now torture any Saint, would be completely ruined.<br /> 
It is a great sin to torture any Saint. You try to understand this from the example of Jesus Christ. Do not commit such stupidity hereafter. Otherwise you may get completely ruined.<br /> 
If one great lesson is to be learnt from the life of Jesus, then that is that you have to remain contented in the state in which the Almighty has placed you. Jesus did not change His mission, He did not separate Himself from the society, considering Himself to be a saṃnyāsī. On the contrary, on occasions He attended certain marriage ceremonies and made the arrangements. Tile Bible says that at one marriage occasion He transformed drinking water into fresh grape Juice.<br />
Now, man has picked up this one incident to suggest that, 'Since Jesus Christ made wine out of water, He used to drink wine.' In Hebrew language you would notice that the word wine means pure juice of fresh grapes. It does not mean alcohol.<br /> 
Jesus Christ incarnated to open the Āgñyā chakra and to dissolve our ego.<br />
My job is to awaken your Kuṇḍalinī Power so that it could pierce your Sahasrāra chakra.<br />
<font color="red">This work is of collective nature: I have, therefore, to do it in the case of one and all, I want to tell you about Jesus Christ, Guru Nāṇaka, King Janaka and a number of other Incarnations and the way they relate with the collectivity.</font> Similarly, I wish to talk to you about Incarnations of Śhrī Rāma, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, etc., and also about Śhrī Śhiva because all the Powers of these Gods and Deities are in us.

We su... we are sustained by water, so They help us to sustain ourselves. They are the sustainers: They tell us how to sustain us as a human being.<br />
And all of Them have tried to establish religion within us.</font><br />

Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism. In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates. He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). <font color="red">Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā).</font> Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918.

These gurus are patently immoral, yet Westerners are so fascinated and enticed by them that they are willing to commit even debauchery at their request.

Another case also personally known to Me concerned a young American who went to India to find Me. Unable to trace Me there, he finally caught up with Me in London. He was a very intelligent young man, studying for a post-graduate degree at a prestigious American university.

Chastity is the power of Ādi Śhakti, the Primordial Mother, and everywhere tāntrikas have ruled, women were insulted and treated as a possession and a toy for the cruel enjoyment of men.

It was the opinion of very few people, who ruled under hypnosis, that counted in those days, who were convinced they had achieved sexual liberation by delving into it.

<font color="red">But Their job was just to establish your dharma. They came at that time in those places where it was needed the most.<br />
So, these Ten Principles, as I told you, They established [dharma].</font><br /> 
<font color="red">They are created in the Void.</font><br />
As you see here the Void part, this part is made out of the water element. <font color="red">So, whatever miracles They did, had something to do with water, like They could create water anywhere They wanted to. They would not cure people. All of Them have created water in the desert or in the places where ... like in ... Nāṇaka has created a Pan̄jā Sāhab they call it, or everywhere They have been able to create water. Whatever They touched, They could create water out of it.</font><br />
Water is the life, life force which sustains us. Without water we cannot live! The is the sustainance [sustenance].<br />
<font color="red">But, They actually are symbolized in an ocean, in the ocean, because They give us the salt, the salt of life, which gives us the sustainance [sustenance].</font> If you see the salt, if we do not have salt in our body, we'll have no sustainance [sustenance]."<br />

"Now when I'm talking to you about the mechanism that is built within us for our last breakthrough, you need not believe Me. <br />
In our country also, this knowledge was kept a secret for thousands of years. Though we can say people like Mārkaṇḍeya, whose dates could be fourteen thousand [years ago], or later on, up to Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, people did write about the Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
And at the time of Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, He very clearly talked about it. That was the tradition of evolution described in all these great Scriptures.<br />
Even in the Bible, you find the Tree of Fire. It says: "I will appear before you as tongues of flames." <br />
Even Muhammad Sāhab, who came much later, very clearly, very, very clearly, and elaborately, at length, talked about the Resurrection Day. He said: "At the Time of Resurrection, your hands will speak."<br />
But everybody missed the point.<br />
Zoroaster talked about it thousands of years back. <font color="red">Confucius, Lao Tze, everyone talked about it: that, 'We have to be the Spirit.'</font><br />
Christ clearly said: "You are to be born-again!" Then Nicodemus asked Him: "Do you mean to say, I should enter into the womb of my mother?" "No," He said, "whatever is born of the flesh is the flesh. You are to be born of the Holy Ghost." "<br />

"The Primordial Master was also born as Macchindranāth, and again as Zoroaster who was worshiped by the ancient Persians, and still revered by Parsis. Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism. <font color="red">In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates.</font> He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā). Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918. Altogether there were ten major Avatāras of Dattātreya."<br />

"Religious fundamentalism and fanaticism have already become a threat to World Peace. We had a discussion with some religious people in Italy and they refused to accept a religion which was global. They wanted to have exclusive religions. In this way they promote conflict between the followers of one religion and those of another. They believe that killing others in the name of religion is their duty. On the other hand all the great philosophers, Incarnations, Prophets and Sufis have never talked about any exclusive religion. <font color="red">Confucius first talked about humanity, but then came Tao of Lao Tze who tried to bring the subtle side of humanity.</font> This Tao is something like the Kuṇḍalinī of Sahaja Yoga. I have traveled through the Yangtze River. This voyage on a boat gave me a unique experience and enabled me to understand Lao Tze very well. This river is a very dangerous one in the beginning for boats to pass through. There are lots of currents which flow in different directions. But along the side of this river there are beautiful manifestations of nature. The very steep, rising mountains that we see in the paintings of the Chinese are all to be seen there with rivers flowing between them. It is very beautiful to see the bank of the Yangtze River. As Lao Tze had said: "It may be very beautiful and attractive outside, but you should keep your mind inside and ply through the Yangtze River". This is very significant, but how many understand what He has said? How many have tried to follow Him? In China many people do not seem to care much for Lao Tze and His Tao, but there will come a time when they will realize that that is the subtle side of humanity."<br />

"About Me also you can ask questions. There are many ways of recognizing because in this life, you have to recognize. You have never recognized an Incarnation so far. You have to recognize.<br />
That is compulsory and that is done through Sahajs Yoga because unless and until you are realized, how are [you] going to recognize Them also?<br />
But even if you have not recognized Them, there was no need for you to crucify Them or to torture.<br />
<font color="red">Then all the Gurus who came on this Earth, the Real Ones -- fakes are never gurus, they are not gurus -- the Real Ones that came on this Earth, say, we can say Moses, Abraham, Nāṇak, Muhammad Sāhib, Kabīr, all these are Incarnations of Primordial Master whom we call as Dattātreya.</font><br />
If They are or not, if Muhammad Sāhib and Guru Nāṇak are the same personality, same people who came in different times, then what justice are we doing to Them? How are we to find out? How are you to believe Me about it?"<br />

"So, if you think evolution is a religion, then I would say Sahaja Yoga is the religion. If your evolution if you call it as a religion, then Sahaja Yoga is a religion. But is a religion which takes you belo ... beyond your sustenance, beyond your religion, dharmātīt, beyond the dharma.<br />
We have amongst ourselves Hindu[s], Muslims, Christians, all kinds of people, you know that. All these people can feel it within themselves: is the religion in their stomachs, they can feel it. They can find out where is the religion. Because, I say, there, religion in the stomach is looked after by the Deities of Primordial Master whom we call as Dattātreya, in the Sanskrit language.<br />
But does't mean Hinduism. It doesn't mean Hinduism at all. But it is called as Dattātreya in the Sanskrit language, in English is Primordial Master.<br />
<font color="red">He is the same who incarnated on this earth: as Moses, as Abraham, and, say, incarnated as Muhammad Sāhab, as Rāja Janaka, as Nāṇaka, and also as Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth.</font> Can you believe that Muhammad Sāhab is the same as our Nāṇak?"<br />

"<font color="red">And when it is worked out with effort, many Gurus and many -- Real Ones, I'm saying, not, I'm not talking of the horrid ones -- but the Real Ones who have been working in the forest, and the great people like Moses, and Abraham and all these people, They knew how difficult it was to raise the Kuṇḍalinī, this coiled thing: gradually, one after another.</font><br />
And the detailed description of this is so horrifying that people get a fright.<br />
Actually when the Kuṇḍalinī rises, normally, by effort of people who are authorized to do it, is such a slow movement that at any center where there is any escape, any weakness, the attention immediately goes on the sides from the cause, from the center. Once it moves to the center, you start getting all kinds of visions."<br />

"But still, as you can see in the life of Christ, that coming of Christ was declared much before Christ came in by the Prophets who made prophecies. All these Prophets belong to the category of the Gurus I am talking about.<br />
So, all over the world three types of movements were on. For example, the scientist[s] on the right-hand side, we can say, and the left-hand side are the devotees of God who sing the praise of God. <font color="red">And in the center there were people like Moses, like Abraham, who came on this earth just to prophesize, just to protect the devotees of God.</font><br />
Now this middle movement of evolution, today, has reached its peak. Because all the Incarnations have arrived now, and have done Their job within you. They have occupied Their position within you, in your awareness, on these different centers. <br />
......<br />
So today we are here to know that within us all these Incarnations exist, and the force that really brought forth, really manifested, who live like human beings and work like Gurus, that force which existed in this area, which created religion within us.<br />
Religion, as we understand, organized religion, is not the religion. But the religion means: your sustaining power. You are a human being because there are ten sustaining powers within you.<br />
So, They came to sustain us and to give us full idea about these Ten Powers and to establish us in our religion as a human being.<br />
So these Gurus, who lived in that area, worked out the sustainace [sustenance] and helped us.<br />
And this is one of the greatest forces we have got, which resides within us.<br />
And whatever They have said has a very great meaning.<br />
Actually, we should say the Main Gurus are ten, but there are many other Gurus.<br />
<font color="red">And these Ten Gurus could be described as Rāja Janaka, then Moses, Abraham, and the in modern times you can say Muhammad Sāhab, and even up to Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth, in Śhirḍī, that force came in, for a short time, and then He disappeared. Nobody knows how He came there, He lived there and He died.</font> Also, if you know Nāṇaka, He was also the same force, the same Primordial Master, who was born on this Earth.<br />
Now, this is not the time to tell about individual people. But, I think, one day I will talk to you only on this subject of the Gurus.<br />
So, these Gurus first started under the Primordial Master Himself, He was called as Dattātreya."<br />

"The thing that really gives you the balance is the sustainance [sustenance], is the sustainance [sustenance], dharma. If you do not have that, then you could go, shoot off like a pendulum from this side to that.<br />
But in dharma also there could be a problem, and that is one of the worst possible, is of fanaticism. So, I mean, if you try to make the dharma a fanatic idea.<br />
<font color="red">Like none of these Incarnations, like Muhammad Sāhab who was a[n] Incarnation of the Primordial Master, and all others like Him, Moses, Abraham, any One of Them who came on this Earth, ever thought of fanaticism. Never they realized, that when they told, 'Don't do this,' 'Don't do that,' some sort of people will take up upon themselves that, 'We are the chosen ones. We are the great.' I mean, this They could never understood. And whenever They found it was happening again They took birth. Again They took birth to tell people: 'This is not dharma.'</font><br />

"Now when They said, "Don't drink," you say, 'Oh-oh, that's out-of-dated. You see, there's Muhammad Sāhab, was no good. He told us not to drink.' Nāṇaka said, "Don't drink."<br />
Now, smoking, you see the results of smoking, now what's happening with smoking. It goes against uh uh your Viśhuddhi. Because, you see, that is the place of Kṛiṣhṇa, and smoking started much later. You see, when He was much earlier, smoking started later on.<br />
That's why Nāṇak Sāhab has talked about it much more.<br />
But uh Muhammad Sāhab did see this point, He did see. So He said, "All ... all the inter... intoxicants and all habits are to be discarded. All such things must be discarded." So, He also wanted mhh yeah ...<br />
...... [Conversation to identify the English word addiction.]<br />
All these addictions must be given up. He said it, very clearly: "No addictions are allowed," according to Him.<br />
But you see, how you make uh-uh-uh uh-uh fuss about things.<br />
Like Muhammad Sāhab and all these Gurus, all these Great Incarnations of the Primordial Master who was Ādi Dattātreya, Ādinātha [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], They taught you how to maintain your religion, your sustainance [sustenance], your balance.<br />
So, immediately the Christians. <font color="red">Because Christ didn't talk much about it because Moses had talked about it, Abraham had talked about it.</font> So Christ did not talk, so they said, "All right. So Christians can drink." Just imagine.<br />
This is a loophole.<br />
That's how they became Christians perhaps. Because they thought that if ... uh they were belonged to the Jews, you see, then they would have ... uh they wouldn't be able to drink.<br />
But Jews drink like Hell. Jews also drink now! I mean the Muslims drink the most, you see.<br />
And worst are the Sikhs: who are prohibited from drinking and smoking, they can beat all your scotch people here, you see. All your scotch whiskey goes into their stomachs [laughter], all these things, and they grow in this, this  beard, thinking that they are great Sikhs going around, you see."<br />

"When Śhrī Rām came, people said that they accepted Paraśhurām, when Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa came they said, they accepted Śhrī Rām, and at the time of Śhrī Nāṇaka, they accepted Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. <font color="red">When Christ was here they accepted Abraham.</font><br />
All of Them had taken human form. But it is all the play of buddhi: how interesting it is!<br />
Now, I have come and people are accepting Śhrī Sāī Nāth.<br />
But when He lived here, He did not even get anything to eat. Why was it so? He was also a human being. As long as He was alive, He too was considered useless and tortured. But when He died, He was regarded as Bhagavān.<br />
What is the reason of this all? Why has man been like this?<br />
You will have water of the Ganges, where She flows. If She is flowing here, will you say, 'We do not accept Her as the Ganges!'? There may be nothing at the place where She was flowing earlier, or maybe only a nullah [ravine] at present. If you want to take it as the Ganges, you go your way. If the Ganges is flowing at this place, why not accept it?<br />
It is not easy to understand human intellect. It is the most difficult job in the world! It is easy to understand God, because He is what He is. He does not have such double dealings. Man has a variety of qualities, not just double. All animals from snakes and scorpions to elephants, horses and lions are residing in him. You will not understand at all, why his brain is working in this way.<br />
Now when the Ganges is flowing why don't you take water from Her?<br />
Imagine this plug has been connected here. Will you connect in its place a plug which is out of order? It is quite pragmatic.<br />
I cannot understand what hallucination is there on human intellect, that he does not accept the Truth which he is seeing but accepts something that is not seen?
Its reason was understood long back and that is ahaṅkār [ego]. Man has too much of ego.<br />
If you had accepted Śhrī Rāma in His days, He would have told you to get your Kuṇḍalinī awakened and get the Realization and get established in Sahaja Yoga.<br />
Had you recognized Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, He would not have played Sahaja Yoga in Gokul, but would have given you the Realization and told you to practice Sahaja Yoga.<br />
If Śhrī Nāṇak had been accepted, there was no need for Him to break His head telling you to do different things. He would have simply taught Sahaja Yoga, but very few understood Him in His days.<br />
Now, when He is not here, you have built gurudwārās in His name.<br />
When Muhammad is not here mosques have been made, because they think now Muhammad Sāhib is in their hands.<br />
Now Rāma is in their hands, and they can make His temple and say, 'His is our temple, this Rāma is our property. We have authority over Him and whatever you have brought, all money and other things, offer them to this idol.'<br />
You say all this because you think you are the authority of this idol. It is sheer ego because of which man thinks, that he can keep God in his control and for that he is making all the show. Every time the same show was repeated."<br />

"For example, there was a doctor from Iran who was suffering from cancer, he came to see Me in London. He had the cancer of the stomach.<br /> 
In this part resides all the Ten Great Masters, or the Primordial Masters, the Incarnations of the Primordial Master.<br /> 
He ... ah ... I told ... I asked him ... uh-uh-uh what religion was he following, he said he was a ... uh-uh-uh Muslim, and out and out Muslim. I said, "What does that mean?", so he said, "It means only Muhammad was the only last Prophet, that cannot be any other Prophet." I said, "How do you know? But how are you so cocksure about it? How can you [laughing:] claim that He was the last Prophet?"<br />
Moreover his cancer was due to that kind of a fanaticism within his stomach. I told him: "You have to believe in other Prophets also." <br />
We had a Prophet in India called Guru Nāṇak, who was the Incarnation of the same. <font color="red">Abraham, Moses, all of Them were the Incarnation of the same Principle.</font><br />
But he would not accept it. I said, "I can't cure your cancer." <br />
So he went back.<br />
But when it comes to life, you understand.<br />
And he came back to Me. He said, "All right, I'll accept, and I'll take the name of Guru Nāṇak." I told him, "Muhammad Sāhāb Himself is angry with you for behaving like this. Because He was not a fanatic like you!" And when he did that, he got all right."<br />

"Apart from that, there is [a] third type of Incarnations which worked [pointing to the Void on the Chakra Chart:] in this gap: to sustain us. These are Ten Pri... Primordial Masters, the Ādi Guru. These people incarnated on this Earth to give us our sustainance [sustenance], our religion as they call it. They gave us those Ten Religions or sustainance [sustenance] which is important for a human being.<br />
<font color="red">This Principle of Primordial Master incarnated as Abraham, as Moses, as Muhammad Sāhab, as Janaka, as Nāṇaka, and recently, till recently, the One who is no more a now, is Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth.</font><br />
[During the translation helps with the enumeration:] Muh... mhh. Socrates. Nāṇaka.<br />
Yes.<br />
<font color="red">Now, these people are Incarnation[s] of the one Principle, that is Primordial Master.<br /> 
The energy or the power with which They work[ed] is either a sister or a daughter: is a very pure relationships.<br /> 
If you read Their teachings you will find [that] They are saying the same things. Because They were worried about our sustainance [sustenance].</font>"<br />

"This is the Holy Ghost about which Christ could not talk to those mad people who really crucified Him.<br />
They were mad that they thought that, 'Christ was blasphemous.' Just think of it! And today we have churches and people, and this and that.<br />
When He lived nobody accepted Him, nobody recognized Him. <font color="red">When He came, they talked of Moses, Abraham.</font><br />
<font color="red">It is very nice to handle Christ, 'Better talk about Them, so that we don't have to face reality.'</font> Because if they had recognized Christ, then Christ would have said, 'All right, if you are recognizing Me, then get your Realization and understand your Self.'<br />
They where not prepared for this.<br />
Only twelve people somehow, you see, managed to be there, somehow. They would not accept Him either. Till He was resurrected, then they accepted Him, in a way.<br />
......<br />
For example, we can say the gree... green thing is the one that represents the water, water element. This center the ... in the stomach is the water element within us. It is called as Nābhī chakra, and around it is called as the Bhavasāgara, you can say the Void, or you can say the Gap, or whatever you may say, the whole world as such, within us. So, the people who were born on this center, around this center, were born out of water element.<br />
<font color="red">In this Bhavasāgara -- oc... Bhavasāgara means the ocean of this world -- were born, through this ocean of the world, were born all the Primordial Masters, one after another. We can say Abraham, Moses, we had Janaka, were Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], and Socrates, and so many others like that, Nāṇaka, and also very recently, we had about hundred years back, a very great Saint born in India known as Sāī Nāth.<br />
They all represent the same element that is the water element. Being responsible or being born out of that, They are anxious to maintain water element as the one which is within us for sustaining ourselves. We su... we are sustained by water, so They help us to sustain ourselves. They are the sustainers: They tell us how to sustain us as a human being.<br />
And all of Them have tried to establish religion within us.</font><br />
A religion doesn't mean outside, but the religion as a man: means the capacity of a man, or you can say the quality of a man. What a human being should be like, what is the way to know if he is a human being or not, which is described in al... in the Ten Commandments."<br />

"When I was born, My father told Me very clearly: that, "The people are born on the ground floor, and if you are born on the tenth floor, they cannot understand you. That's why they crucified Christ." What a mistake it was!<br />
When Kṛiṣhṇa came they said they believed in Rāma. <font color="red">Same here, when Christ came in they said, "We believe in Abraham." When Moses ... or when Moses came they said, "We believe in Abraham."</font><br />
That's how they avoided to accept someone who was telling the Truth! It is nice to have somebody be... believe into someone who is dead because you can do whatever you like with it. He is not going to sit on your head. And even if he comes back, you will say, 'He is not the same,' or kill him or crucify him or give him poison or torture him."<br />

"And these Ten Sustainances [Sustenances] are represented by Great Prophets. The Principle is called as Ādi Guru, in Sanskrit language, the Primordial Master. <font color="red">He had incarnated on this Earth as Abraham, Moses, as Lao Tze, as Confucius, as Socrates.</font> Recently, He has been as Sāī Nāth of Śhirḍī, not the other fellow, and other great people have been like Nāṇaka, Janaka.<br />
All these Great Saints can ... came on this Earth to tell us: how to keep in the center, how to keep our sustenance, how to be human beings.<br />
As carbon has got four valances, we too have got ten valances. We have to maintain those ten valances within us! That's what they came to tell us."<br />

"In every religion there is some sort of a stupid stuff pushed forward, in every. Nobody could really stop it. Because those people who are in charge of religion have no enlightenment, they have nothing to k... do with it, anywhere.<br />
And that's how, I have seen, people, say, in Japan, they follow one religion, and in uh-uh-uh China they follow another religion, both are just the same: one is Zen, another is Tao. But the misunderstanding is that they think, 'We are ex-xu-xu-xclusive [exclusive].' They are not! None of them are exclusive!.<br />
<font color="red">Muhammad Sāhab described all of Them: from Abraham to Moses, to Christ, to the Mother of Christ. And He said, :There have been more than one lākh Nabīs on this Earth."</font><br />
But now, why to feel that we are exclusive? This exclusiveness comes from where?<br />
<font color="red">With Christ also, He described all of Them!</font><br />
Ta-o, the one religion that they follow in China, is nothing but Sahaja Yoga: Ta-o is Kuṇḍalinī. Zen is nothing [laughing:] but Sahaja. Zoroaster, everyone.<br />
But this exclusiveness has brought this problem, and they are fighting among each other."<br />

"The Primordial Master was also born as Macchindranāth, and again as Zoroaster who was worshiped by the ancient Persians, and still revered by Parsis. <font color="red">Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism.</font> In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates. He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā). Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918. Altogether there were ten major Avatāras of Dattātreya."<br />

"Actually Hazarat Muhammad never made Islam an exclusive religion in the Qur'ān. <font color="red">He very respectfully talked about Moses, Abraham, Christ and His Mother, one after another.</font> Even so Muslims believe they are exclusive. Jews and Christians also believe theirs are exclusive religions. There is another problem -- they believe that Muhammad was the exclusive messenger of God and Christians believe that Christ is the last word, while Jews believe that their Savior has yet to come. If these Incarnations were the last ones why did Muhammad say, "I will send you the Twelfth Mahdī?" Also why did Christ say that He would send the Holy Ghost? We cannot say how long the Jews are going to wait for their Savior to come. They are wailing and crying before the wailing wall wearing the Torah in small amulets, but actually the most important thing for them is to collect the money that they have lent and buy diamonds at any cost."<br />

"For example, the war in Bosnia is the misidentification of Croats, Muslims and Serbs. They follow the Christian and Muslim religions. The Croats are Catholic Christians but do they follow Christ? What about Muslims who believe in the Formless God and despite this fight for land? Actually, Muhammad never talked of an exclusive religion. <font color="red">He talked about Abraham, Moses and Christ in a series and the fourth was Himself. Even Christ talked about Abraham and Moses.</font> Why do people who follow Moses, Christ or Muhammad fight? They have the same roots. At least these three religions should produce people who understand the oneness of their religions. Of course, the Hindu religion is not exclusive. It accepts all the religions but even Hindus in charge of religious affairs have made different laws for different religions. They are taking advantage of the minorities for votes in the Democracy."<br />

"In Japan we had another great Master whose name was Viditama. He was the disciple of Lord Buddha and he went to Japan and started the Zen system. Zen means meditation -- dhyāna -- and he wanted people to become "thoughtlessly aware". He found out many ways of making people "thoughtlessly aware" -- the tea ceremony and the temples that they have, are all meant to create thoughtless awareness. I was amazed that none of the Japanese knew what the purpose of these gardens were. There is one garden which has some moss on top of a hill in a very small area and it is very interesting. You have to see the flowers and other foliage there through a magnifying glass. All this should amaze a person and one should become thoughtlessly aware. That was the idea of Zen, but surprisingly, few understood Zen. Then there was a Prophet, Zoroaster, who was born five times in His country, Persia. Ultimately Muhammad Sāhib had to come to say something very clearly about religion. But the people who followed Muhammad Sāhib, never realized the oneness of His preaching or that of Zoroaster, and they made all the Persians run away to all the other countries and so many of them came to India.<br />
<font color="red">Muhammad Sāhib has talked about Abraham, Moses, Christ in a series as They came one after the other.</font> He has talked about the Mother of Christ especially with great respect. In the Bible She is not given so much respect because of Paul who edited the Bible. She is just called "the woman". But Prophet Muhammad says that anyone who talks against this Holy Lady will be punished, or something to that effect. So one can see that Muhammad Sāhib never talked of an exclusive religion called "Islam" (i.e., I surrender to God Almighty). But so many followers of Islam are fighting the followers of other religions and even amongst themselves."<br />

"As the Kuṇḍalinī rises into the third part, next to the Nābhī chakra, we become absolutely righteous. This area, which we call as the Ocean of Illusion, is enlightened by Ten Principles of Mastery. The Great Masters have created these ten centers of commandments which are enlightened and we become holy. There is no need to be strict in one's behavior. We automatically become really spiritual. Like an egg becomes the bird, we are born twice. In Sanskrit a Yogi or the one who knows Brahma, meaning the All-pervading Power, is called dvija and a bird is also called dvija, meaning twice-born. <font color="red">There were Abraham and Moses and all the Ten Primordial Masters who have been born again and again on this Earth.</font> Zoroaster has been born five times and also so many of these were born in different places in different countries to guide the people to take to religious life to establish the necessary balance for the ascent."<br />
