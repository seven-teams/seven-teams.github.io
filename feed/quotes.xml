You see there is a saṅkoch, like not sort of to go to somebody's house and then to start demanding this and that. Rather you should be worried how far to go with a person, how far to talk to a person, how far to go with your wife, with your children. You see, all that is saṅkoch. Saṅkoch means restraint in a wise way, enlightened restraint -- how far to go is the question."</font><br />

[Answer to the question, "When this knowledge come to Toy?":] <font color="red">"I knew about it since I was born. I knew about Myself. If I have done anything it is to understand human beings. What's their problem? They follow Christ, they follow Muhammad Sāhab, they follow Rāma, they follow Kṛiṣhṇa, and they follow everything but nothing inside. What is the matter? Nothing penetrates, that was the thing. I thought they were not connected. They are to be connected to all this. Only what I have done is to work out the permutation and combination of human beings. That's not difficult because there are mainly seven chakras one has to work out and how you can raise the Kuṇḍalinī to break the Sahasrāra."</font><br />

<font color="red">"Apart from this, the greatest problem of the jet age is this: that before the Advent of Rāma, Rāvaṇa was bon ... born. And that's why Rāma had to come. Before the Advent of Christ, Herod was born. Before Kṛiṣhṇa, actually Kṛiṣhṇa got His birth because Kaṃsa was there. And Bhagavatī took Her forms always to kill some demons. But I tell you, this killing has helped us not much, because all of them are back again, in their seat. This Kṛiṣhṇa Haraṇa Śhakti has only killed their bodies, again all of them are back on these banners, as if they are the godmen.<br />

After that Śhrī Rāma incarnated in this world but He forgot that He was an Incarnation.

<font color="red">"Sītājī was Śhrī Rāma's wife. Was married. The injustice that was done to Her by the society, made Her leave the house, by accusing Her falsely, disgraced Her. Why back then these great people had a blindfold on? Why didn't they said, that, `She is our Mother? You are asking Her to leave the house?' She already had passed the test, bypassing the fire, why were they dumbfounded then? What happened to their vigor [light] back then? All were so-called very great then. Nobody raised any point on that.<br />
To teach them a lesson Rādhājī did not marry Kṛiṣhṇa under the societal norms. But still, the whole world knows Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa as Rādhā-Kṛiṣhṇa. But for Him, the formal marriage is important, that's why there was no child."</font><br />

<font color="red">"During the Tretā Yuga, at the time of Śhrī Rāma, Ādi Śhakti incarnated in three separate human personalities, expressing Her three aspects:<br />
&emsp;1. Sītā [Jānakī] (Mahālakṣhmī) as the daughter of Rāja Janaka<br />
&emsp;&emsp;This was the first absolute human form (<i>Laukik</i>)"</font><br />
<font size="+0"><b>The Book of Ādi Śhakti, Chapter 1: Creation, the Eternal Play</b></font>
</p>

<div class="para-divider"></div>

<p>
<font color="red">"This spiritual awakening in man grew very strong and was again challenged by the evil forces who incarnated to disturb their search through penance (<i>yagonya</i>). At this time, much before the seventh Incarnation of Śhrī Viṣhṇu as Lord Rāma, the Primordial Mother incarnated as the Goddess Durgā, Mother of the Universe. She incarnated from the Primordial Heart Center (Ādi Anāhata Chakra) called the Sacred heart in the Virāṭa. There have been one hundred and eight main Incarnations of the Goddess Durgā to save seekers from the evil of satanic forces.<br />
Maheśha (Śhiva), Viṣhṇu and Brahmadeva form the Trinity which incarnated as one teacher God, the Primordial Master, Dattātreya. He came onto this Earth to teach people the secrets of the Divine, to reveal God, and to help them cross the Ocean of Illusion themselves within their own identity. Evolution could not go further in the hands of human beings who were in the bondage of ignorance, so they were given guidance through this Incarnation of the Primordial Master (Ādi Guru) again and again in different lives. He was created as the three-headed child, Dattātreya, by Ādi Śhakti who appeared on Earth during the Tretā Yuga as Satī Anasūyā, wife of the Sage Atreya. He was born as Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara] who founded Jainism -- one of the oldest religions. Then he was born as Rāja Janaka, father of Jānakī also called Sītā, Rāma's wife. She was an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti.<br />
The Primordial Master was also born as Macchindranāth, and again as Zoroaster who was worshiped by the ancient Persians, and still revered by Parsis. Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism. In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates. He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā). Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918. Altogether there were ten major Avatāras of Dattātreya.<br />
It is very important to understand that until the animal stage there was no need for animals to solve the problem of life, as animals were under the complete command of God. At the human stage, however, as we learn from the history of Adam and Eve, they were given the choice and freedom to solve the problem of life. That was how evolution was to go a step further. Without such freedom human beings were not equipped to learn the secrets of Divine Power.<br />
Ādi Viṣhṇu Himself took His seventh Incarnation during the Tretā Yuga as Lord Rāma, a human being who crossed the Ocean of Illusion and touched a new dimension of awareness. As Śhrī Rāma, Ādi Viṣhṇu came to enlighten human social and political consciousness as the true model of what Plato, thousand of years later, would call 'the philosopher king'. He settled for human beings the rules of socio-political correct action (<i>samāj tatha rājkaraṇ dharma</i>). He also expressed God's aspect of majesty and order within kingship and institutions, and led a life of an ideal human being (<i>Maryādā Puruṣhottama</i>). This was witnessed by multitudes, resulting in a mass awareness for the first time among human beings. Śhrī Rāma was the ideal King for all kings, and <i>Rām Rājya</i>, His kingdom, was the ideal kingdom.<br />
He reached a point in the Primordial Heart Chakra (Ādi Anāhata Chakra) crossing the Void along the central path (Ādi Suṣhumṇā Nāḍī). His wife Sītā was an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. The <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i>, the epic about Lord Rāma's exploits written by Vālmīki, tells how Lord Rāma was made to forget that He was the Reincarnation of Ādi Viṣhṇu for some time, because it was desired that He should act absolutely like a human being, to make them feel absolutely free with him. He gave them a human leadership. Later on, when Sītā disappeared back into the Mother Earth, Lord Rāma remembered His divinity.<br />
At the time of Rāma's Incarnation Ādi Śhakti existed in three persons: Mahālakṣhmī, as Sītā, His wife; Mahāsaraswatī, as Satī Anasūyā who gave birth to Dattātreya, the Primordial Master; and Mahākālī as Mandodarī, the wife of the demon Rāvaṇa.<br />
......<br />
Whilst Dattātreya's Incarnation was created in the Void, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's was at a much higher point, higher than even the Primordial Heart Chakra on which Lord Rāma took Incarnation. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's seat in the body of the Virāṭa is the Ādi Viśhuddhi Chakra, and is placed at the base of the neck inside the spinal cord. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was in fact the Complete Incarnation of the Virāṭa whose form (<i>swarūpa</i>) He showed in a vision to His disciple Arjuna. His teachings to Arjuna are compiled in the <i>Śhrī Bhagavad Gītā</i>. As the Embodiment of the Witness State He killed many male and female evil geniuses (rākṣhasas and rākṣhasīs), as Lord Rāma had done. These entities have to be killed and destroyed again and again whenever they come in the way of human evolution. Ādi Śhakti's Incarnations are also mostly to kill demons. <br />
The Incarnations of Rādhā show how the ideas of human beings gradually changed. The life as Rādhā was definitely a peg above in social advancement in the dogmatic thinking of society, compared to the time of Sītā. She was not married to Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa in a formal human way (<i>laukika</i>). Their wedding was divine (<i>alaukika</i>), and was performed spiritually and socially in the presence of many people by Brahmadeva. Earlier, as Sītā, although formally married to Rāma in a wedding ceremony that was collectively sanctioned, She was still condemned by society. Kṛiṣhṇa's love and adoration of Rādhā brought Her glory without marriage, while Sītā was denied that public acceptance even though She was the legal wife of Rāma.<br />
Princess Sītā was married to King Rāma in a very traditional way. When He went into exile, Rāvaṇa the rākṣhasa, Satan disguised as an ascetic, appeared before Her and took Her away to the capital of his kingdom in Lanka. Rāma fought a war with Rāvaṇa to rescue His wife, who was secluded by Rāvaṇa in the core of his island kingdom. Rāma defeated His enemy and brought Sītā back to His kingdom, Ayodhyā. Although She was the purest of the pure, and the holiest of the holy, She was treated with suspicion by the citizens of Ayodhyā, Rāma's capital city. They would not accept Her as queen, blaming Her for having been abducted by force by Rāvaṇa. The suspicious citizens questioned Her chastity, and committed collective sin by rejecting Her. Although She was pregnant Rāma was forced to forsake Her. She lived with the Saint Vālmīki in the jungles of Bihar State where She gave birth to twin boys, Lava and Kuśha. They were absolutely human personalities but of very great spiritual heritage from previous births. Sītā taught them the divine way of life. They were later born again in Bihar as Gautama, known as Lord Buddha, and as Śhrī Mahāvīra, the leader of the great religion, Jainism. This all happened 500 years before the birth of Christ. Internally they reached a very great height through these births. They preached the doctrine of nonviolence (<i>ahiṃsā</i>) which was later developed into an extreme form of vegetarianism. They took birth in the warrior caste (<i>Kṣhatriya</i>) rather than as fanatical Brahmins in order to keep away from the extremes of vegetarian abstinences, and to stay more balanced. Still their disciples carried their teachings to the extreme of abstinence and vegetarianism. They confused inner asceticism (<i>saṃnyāsa</i>) with organized institutions of asceticism, and nonviolence with vegetarianism. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was later very much criticized by the so-called vegetarian followers of Buddha and Mahāvīra.<br />
......<br />
When one takes the name of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa one has to take the name of Rādhā first, so a seeker recites the mantra to the Virāṭa as 'Rādhā-Kṛiṣhṇa'. Similarly Sītā's name has to be taken before Rāma's for the mantra 'Sītā-Rāma'. Even the Virgin Mary (<i>Kanyā</i>) who was so quiet and potential at the time of Christ, was recognized later on by His disciples as the Power behind Him. She was worshiped for many years after Her death by early Christians. In modern times human beings who are satanic personalities are challenging the validity of the Primordial Mother's virginity and the Virgin Birth in particular. Mary has clearly shown the power of virginity that can raise a mother to such an exalted powerful position that she can conceive a child by desire alone. She had reached that high stage of evolution when by Her Divine Will, She could immaculately conceive. There are other such instances in Hindu purāṇik literature when Kuntī, by the wish of the Mantra, gave birth to the Pāṇḍavas and to Karṇa immaculately."</font><br />

<font color="red">"Tāntrikas controlled their spirits individually or in groups, and gave them mantras as code-names. One mantra for example, `{\it Auṃ Aim Hrīm Klīm Chāmuṇḍāya Vichai namaḥ}', is properly used to awaken Ādi Śhakti as Jagadambā or Chāmuṇḍā. This beautiful and powerful mantra should only be used by a realized Soul under the guidance of an evolved guru. But the same mantra was used by tāntrikas in such a way that each syllable was instrumental in summoning a group of dead spirits to be tamed and used by them. It is the same principle as giving your servant the name of a Deity, such as Rāma, which is quite a common usage in India. When you want your servant you call out the name of Rāma, and he is available at your beck and call. But God is not similarly available to every Tom, Dick or Harry. One has to be a realized Soul and have an authority to call God. Those who call Him without such authority will only succeed in summoning the services of dead spirits as slaves. Such dead beings will respond to a call for Rāma, if that was their name in earthly life. God however does not need the homage of such slaves."</font><br />

His seventh Incarnation was as Śhrī Rāma who resides on the right side of the Heart chakra with His Power, Śhrī Sītā. Rāma incarnated as the representation of a personality who was the perfect male human being (<i>Maryādā Puruṣhottama</i>). Lord Viṣhṇu's eighth Incarnation was as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa who, with His Power Rādhā, resides on the Viśhuddhi chakra. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was the ultimate expression of the Primordial Being (Virāṭa) in human form, and taught us to regard the Creation as a play (<i>Līlā</i>) of the Divine Power."</font><br />

<br />
&emsp;1. On the left side of the Chakra, Pārvatī resides with Her husband, Lord Śhiva. He governs the left side channel of Iḍā nāḍī.<br />
&emsp;2. On the right side of the Chakra is the seat of Lord Rāma, an Incarnation of Ādi Viṣhṇu, and His wife, Sītā, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti.<br />
&emsp;3. Pārvatī enters alone into the central part of the Chakra as Durgā or Jagadambā, Mother of the World. When Ādi Viṣhṇu incarnated as Lord Rāma, this central part was vacated by Durgā who, in Her role as wife, rejoined Lord Śhiva in the left chamber whilst Lord Rāma with Sītā occupied the central chamber.<br />

The left part of this Chakra governed by Śhiva and Pārvatī has the sustenance of existence, of innocence, simplicity and steadfastness. The right part of the Chakra is governed by Śhrī Rāma and His dedicated wife, Sītā, and has the sustenance of majesty, and His perfect political leadership.

<font color="red">"Those people who do not respect their parents and their elders always have a weak Mūlādhāra chakra when they come to Sahaja Yoga. They also have a very weak right Heart center (Anāhata chakra) where Śhrī Rāma resides with His wife, Sītā. If they are particularly unkind to their mothers, then the center and right Heart gets very weak. We must therefore understand just how important our parents are, and how the spiritual link is held in the inner being of personality. Our parents have their roots in the Primordial Parents, and marriage has its roots in their primordial and eternal loving relationship. Those who do not respect their marriage, or enjoy the glory of their chastity, also suffer from a very weak Heart center and Mūlādhāra chakra. In such shameless, sex-obsessed people the Kuṇḍalinī just does not rise."</font><br />

For example when Śhrī Rāma was exiled and went to a forest, he met there a poor old woman called Śhabarī who was of tribal caste. She offered some berries to Śhrī Rāma with great affection and devotion. She said: ``Please eat them because they are not at all sour. I have already tasted them." The food or fruits tasted by somebody else are not to be eaten (uttiṣhṭa). If someone has bitten off even a part of a fruit, that fruit is no longer pure and cannot be offered to another person, certainly not to an Incarnation. But Śhrī Rāma was greatly moved by the love of the old lady. He accepted the berries with much joy and ate them. He praised their taste and gave some to his wife, Sītā. His brother Lakṣhmaṇ, felt rather jealous and asked for some berries for himself. There are many incidents where Śhrī Rām gets very friendly with people who were not of very high castes. Also his own Rāmāyaṇa, his life story, was written by a fisherman who was a dacoit. This fisherman was transformed into a Saint by another heavenly minstrel called Nārada. Of course an ordinary fisherman who was also a dacoit had such respect for Śhrī Rāma that he wrote this beautiful epic, the Rāmāyaṇa."</font><br />

<font color="red">"Śhrī Rāma has many special qualities. He was very powerful and a perfect archer. You might have heard about what He did in Sītā Swayaṃwara.<br />
The same Śhrī Rāma killed the Rāvaṇa when He came to it. Tulasīdās has described His bow very very beautifully. Śhrī Rāma was aiming at Rāvaṇa's head with His arrow. Out of ten head's of Rāvaṇa one will fall down, but again it will assume its place. Lakṣhmaṇa suggested Śhrī Rāma to shoot an arrow in the heart of Rāvaṇa, without which he will not die. "Hit him in the heart." Śhrī Rāma was a very humble person. Though He was very powerful yet hH said to Lakṣhmaṇa that, "Rāvaṇa has placed My Sītā in his heart, therefore, I cannot hit him in the heart. Again and again when I chop off his heads, his attention will be diverted from the heart. Only then shall I shoot him in the heart."<br />
What an example of the love of a husband for His Wife! Ocean of Power, how He was full of love! "</font><br />

<p>
<font color="red">"So, at that time, Śhrī Rāma's mother-in-law, I should say, who was the wife of Daśharatha, she said ... she used to s... she's r... like a big uh-uh-uh ... Sādhunī, and she said that: "From today, two marriages are not allowed, only one."<br />
So among Hindus there's only one marriage. They don't have two marriages. And regard it as a very sinful to have another woman, according to Indian culture. There are some people who do it, but is wrong. Is not Indian.<br />
The father-in-law passed the law, because he has, he suffered -- he had two wives. And one of them tried to send Śhrī Rām to the jungle. She was so cruel, because she wanted her son to become the king. And, as it was the mistake of the father, that he had promish... promised that he will give her a boon [twp boons], because she had saved him in war. And so now, she asked him to send Śhrī Rām to the vanavas [vanam], to the-uh jungle. By-ee-eeh second one [boon], she asked to give the kingdom to her son, who was Lakṣhmaṇa.<br />
But when Lakṣhmaṇa came he didn't want. He said, "I don't want to take Śhrī Rāma's ... uah-uah-uah seat because it is his right."<br />
So he went to Śhrī Rām, in the jungle, requested him: "To You must come! You must come to Ayodhyā, to the capital city, and You should be crowned." Śhrī Rām said, "I can't do it. I have to fulfill my father's wish."<br />
But, at that moment,, the father said that,  "In India nobody will have second marriage." Because of two wives the whole family suffered! So, him ... he said, "Only we can have one wife, and no two wives."<br />
Very surprising, that even till today, in India they believe that you should have only one wife.<br />
But uh-uh-uh what you find in another countries, that people may not have another wife, but they have affairs and they do not respect their wives. This is very sad! And the this makes the country suffering. Because if the women are treated like that, the women suffer, and if the mother suffers the children suffer.<br />
So he made a law: that, 'Nobody will marry twice.' "</font><br />

And Her two children were, Hasan and Husayn, back then, when They saw even after the annihilation of the world, the human beings did not understand, then They were born as Buddha and Mahāvīra and They brought the non-violence as religion, and attempted that, 'Maybe with the establishment of non-violence people will achieve Self-realization.'

<font color="red">"After the birth of the daughter of Muhammad Sāhab, as I talked yesterday also, there was beginning of the caste Shia in Islam.<br />
Shia word has been derived from Siyā. The word which come from Siyā became Shia -- Siyā means Sītājī. If you go to UP [Uttar Pradesh, India] then nobody says Sītājī, they say Siyājī, 'Siyā var Rām[a]chandra ki jay.' Everyone takes the name Siyā. She was Sītājī, Ādi Śhakti Herself.<br />
And Her two sons, who were Hasan and Husayn, destroyed many evils. When They ultimately died after getting tried, then in the next birth they thought of establishment of nonviolence, violence led them nowhere.<br />
They were [re]born as Mahāvīr and Buddha to make a new experiment. Experiments do happen. "</font><br />

There are three stages to that also, but just now I have told this: the Sat-chit-ānand State.<br />
The God's Realization is the state in which Gautam Buddha and Mahāvīra only rose, and They are settled down here in our brains, both of Them are here, Christ is here.<br />
And these two were not Incarnations: They were born as human beings. They were born to Sītā, as Lav and Kuśh. Then they were born as Buddha and Mahāvīra. Then Ādi Śhakti was Their mother again. Then they were born to Fāṭimah Bi as Hasan and Husayn.<br />
They are both placed here, in your head.<br />
And They are the two milestones you have got, by which you can know what a human being can rise up to that now today They are like Incarnations. Incarnations are beyond, but maybe the gap can be bri... bridged."</font><br />

<font color="red">"Now in this Void we have two great entities as well which we know as Chandra [Moon] and Sūrya [Sun]. Moon and Sun are such chakras which reside on these nāḍīs here and here.<br />
On these chakras there are two very great personalities who have been appointed. They are complete embodiment of human beings. They are like humans, in fact are humans. Out of these one is Buddha and one is Mahāvīra.<br />
But if you listen to the whole history of Their lives, then these are two sons which Śhrī Sītā had as Lav and Kuśha who is completely in human form. And after They evolved to the level that They are here as Buddha and Mahāvīra. There also they thought They have reached an extreme of nonviolence because the supports of nonviolence came in and started protecting even mosquitoes and bugs.<br />
Then They again took birth and came at the time of Muhammad. Muhammad was an Incarnation of Śhrī Janaka and His daughter Fāṭimah Bi was also Incarnation of Śhrī Sītā.<br />
Then, as Their sons as Hasan and Husayn, They gave Their life in Karbalāʾ to prove that no kind of extreme is good.<br />
And this thing is Truth or not you can see on your vibrations. If [one thinks that] I am lying, then through your vibrations you would know that not even one single word is a lie here that I am telling you. "</font><br />

<font color="red">"Specially, these are the days of your marty[rdo]m. And I know about it, everything, what had happened to Hasan and Husayn. You all have done lot of penance for Them, and are still doing it. But now the time has come for all of you to know that Their sacrifice, Their kurbānī, has been completely fulfilled. After all, what did They want? They wanted whatever Their father, ʿAlī, wanted Them to do, also Their mother Fāṭimah. But we don't know, 'Who They were? What Incarnations They were? What was Their job?'<br />
......<br />
No need to feel guilty. You are not the ones who killed Hasan and Husayn, and still, if you feel that Hasan and Husayn should have lived, They can live through your lives. Only thing you have to know: how to become personality, make your personality of Their level. "</font><br />

<font color="red">"Later They were born in Arabia as Hasan and Husayn, the two sons of Fāṭimah, daughter of Muhammad Sāhib. They were murdered in a very violent war at Karbalāʾ. Their death signifies a great sacrifice in the name of religion. It is an indication how people who are extreme in nature take to fanaticism and, in their blindness, kill the very essence of religion that is born in flesh and blood as an Incarnation. This awakening gave a rude shock to the mass of religious human beings of the land, and there ensued a phenomenon of mass repentance. In this way people were made to realize that there can be no attachment to war for a realized Soul. Violence and nonviolence are attributes of mind but awareness is beyond these extremes. In defense of righteousness one has to go to war, but when one becomes the witness one only sees the play of war without taking any credit or discredit for it, or being disturbed by its aggression.<br />
After Fāṭimah, the Reincarnation of Sītā, died, sectarian war broke out among the Muslims. One side, the Shiya sect, was founded by Her; in Indian dialect Sītā is pronounced 'Shiya'. They are known today as Shiites. Shiya women are regarded as fair, innocent and beautiful because of their motherly expressions; in the same way the women of Janakapur, Sītā's birthplace in India, are similarly blessed by Mahālakṣhmī."</font><br />

<font color="red">"Princess Sītā was married to King Rāma in a very traditional way. When He went into exile, Rāvaṇa the rākṣhasa, Satan disguised as an ascetic, appeared before Her and took Her away to the capital of his kingdom in Lanka. Rāma fought a war with Rāvaṇa to rescue His wife, who was secluded by Rāvaṇa in the core of his island kingdom. Rāma defeated His enemy and brought Sītā back to His kingdom, Ayodhyā. Although She was the purest of the pure, and the holiest of the holy, She was treated with suspicion by the citizens of Ayodhyā, Rāma's capital city. They would not accept Her as queen, blaming Her for having been abducted by force by Rāvaṇa. The suspicious citizens questioned Her chastity, and committed collective sin by rejecting Her. Although She was pregnant Rāma was forced to forsake Her. She lived with the Saint Vālmīki in the jungles of Bihar State where She gave birth to twin boys, Lava and Kuśha. They were absolutely human personalities but of very great spiritual heritage from previous births. Sītā taught them the divine way of life. They were later born again in Bihar as Gautama, known as Lord Buddha, and as Śhrī Mahāvīra, the leader of the great religion, Jainism. This all happened 500 years before the birth of Christ. Internally they reached a very great height through these births. They preached the doctrine of nonviolence (<i>ahiṃsā</i>) which was later developed into an extreme form of vegetarianism. They took birth in the warrior caste (<i>Kṣhatriya</i>) rather than as fanatical Brahmins in order to keep away from the extremes of vegetarian abstinences, and to stay more balanced. Still their disciples carried their teachings to the extreme of abstinence and vegetarianism. They confused inner asceticism (<i>saṃnyāsa</i>) with organized institutions of asceticism, and nonviolence with vegetarianism. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was later very much criticized by the so-called vegetarian followers of Buddha and Mahāvīra. "</font><br />

<font color="red">"The Primordial Master was also born as Macchindranāth, and again as Zoroaster who was worshiped by the ancient Persians, and still revered by Parsis. Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism. In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates. He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā). Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918. Altogether there were ten major Avatāras of Dattātreya.<br />
Later They were born in Arabia as Hasan and Husayn, the two sons of Fāṭimah, daughter of Muhammad Sāhib. They were murdered in a very violent war at Karbalāʾ. Their death signifies a great sacrifice in the name of religion. It is an indication how people who are extreme in nature take to fanaticism and, in their blindness, kill the very essence of religion that is born in flesh and blood as an Incarnation. This awakening gave a rude shock to the mass of religious human beings of the land, and there ensued a phenomenon of mass repentance. In this way people were made to realize that there can be no attachment to war for a realized Soul. Violence and nonviolence are attributes of mind but awareness is beyond these extremes. In defense of righteousness one has to go to war, but when one becomes the witness one only sees the play of war without taking any credit or discredit for it, or being disturbed by its aggression.<br />
After Fāṭimah, the Reincarnation of Sītā, died, sectarian war broke out among the Muslims. One side, the Shiya sect, was founded by Her; in Indian dialect Sītā is pronounced 'Shiya'. They are known today as Shiites. Shiya women are regarded as fair, innocent and beautiful because of their motherly expressions; in the same way the women of Janakapur, Sītā's birthplace in India, are similarly blessed by Mahālakṣhmī."</font><br />

<font color="red">"Brahmadeva represents that aspect of God Almighty which manifests as the Creator of both the subtle side (esthetics), and of the gross side of material creation. Brahmadeva looks like an ascetic, a saintly personality, with a beard and mustache. He has four heads and all the hair on His heads is tied up in a top-knot. His body is thin with His most prominent feature being bulging and very large eyes. Brahmadeva rarely incarnates but He has incarnated once as Hazarat ʿAlī, husband of Fāṭimah and son-in-law of Muhammad Sāhib. Some ancient Sages tried to explain the meaning of His four heads as the expression of creation into four <i>Vedas</i>. The meaning of His heads is much wider and deeper, though. Brahmadeva is the symbol of the Creative Power of the Supreme, the Īśhwara, Brahma, God. This creative power is expressed through the plane of matter in this universe. All material things have three dimensions but there is a fourth dimension which only human beings can see and feel. This fourth dimension is the esthetic dimension created by balanced harmonies and the integration of different textures, forms and lines. Animals have no sense of beauty; only human beings can feel the esthetics of a composition of different colors, or the movement of lines and the melting of forms. The feelings of joy acquired through this esthetic sense create a <i>Rasa</i> (a secretion of the essence or juice of a feeling). This Rasa gives one a stimulative feeling that sets in motion waves of esthetic joy within the Inner Self. These joys are of different frequencies and vibrations. One does not need to dissect them but as I look at the different petals of this chakra, I shall try to explain the kinds of joys present in the realm of creativity expressed through divine enlightenment.

There's a fisherman in India ... [after 17 seconds (durig which She drinks whater):] who is, I mean is ... he's a graduate, though he's a fisherman. So, [laughing:] one day [in 1981], he was going on a boat to another island [village of Sakhar] to do Sahaja Yogaa. And when he came out of his hut he found huge, big clouds, black ones, hovering, and the Viṣhṇumāyā playing. Just he stood on the shore, and told Viṣhṇumāyā: "Please tell these clouds to behave themselves! I am going for the work of Mother, and dare not trouble me on the way!" Just stop it.<br />
The people who were with him told Me that this Hariśhchandra [Koli] was talking like that.<br />
They got into the boat, they did the program, came home. When he went into his boat [bed], uh rain started.<br />

Yeśhodā was Herself an Incarnation of Mahāsaraswatī. As Mahālakṣhmī She took two forms, Rādhā and Rukmiṇī. '<i>Rā</i>' means power or energy and '<i>dhā</i>' means sustenance, so the name 'Rādhā' means the one who sustains the power.

<font color="red">"The writings of these great enlightened souls are mostly in Sanskrit and were not available to the general public. Whenever translated they were not even mentioning Kuṇḍalinī awakening as the only way to achieve Self-realization. It was completely deleted when translated. It was in the twelfth century that a Great Incarnation of a Saint, Śhrī Gyāneśhwara (God of Knowledge) was born. He live[d] for only twenty-three years. They were three brothers and one sister. All of them were tortured by the dharma-mārtaṇḍas. Gyāneśhwara took the permission of His Guru (Master), who was His eldest brother, and wrote in the regional language a book called Gyāneśhwarī. In the sixth chapter He clearly wrote about Kuṇḍalinī but again the people in charge of religion (dharma-mārtaṇḍas) said that this chapter was not allowed to be read (niṣhiddha)."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="red">"Then came, in the Twelfth Century, a great Saint called Gyāneśhwara in Maharashtra. It was a tradition of his time that one Master of Nāth Pānthis could give Realization only to one disciple. This Master was not supposed even to talk about the fourth dimension to normal people. They were only told that they should remember God and should sing the praise of God. But He, the great poet and a very great Saint, Gyāneśhwara, felt that it was time that the subject of spiritual ascent should be made much more clear to people.<br />
In Gītā there is no description of the Kuṇḍalinī or of the awakening, though Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, at the very outset, has said that a person should achieve the state of Sthitapragñya, which means, the one who is balanced, through enlightenment by Divine Knowledge. All this was a description, but he did not talk about how it is brought about.<br />
It was Śhrī Gyāneśhwara who wrote a treatise on Gītā called as Gyāneśhwarī. In the sixth chapter he very sweetly described the nature of this fourth power, called the Kuṇḍalinī which rests in the triangular bone and the way it is awakened by some great Soul by which one gets his fourth state of awareness. He did not take permission from his guru to give Realization to others but he only asked that he should be permitted at least to write about it. Later on, this sixth chapter was not understood by the people who were in charge of religion (dharma-mārtaṇḍas). They said that this sixth chapter was not to be read (niṣhiddha) and thus this great chapter was completely neglected by the people and they just tried to follow the path of bhakti, which means devotion to God by chanting the names of God or singing the praise of God Almighty.<br />
There were three types of movements in our country. In the first one, people wanted to know about matter, the origin of matter, the origin of this world. In this quest they came to know how our right side is built up and what the elements that build our body are. The advancement on this knowledge led to science as a new field of study. Another aspect was constituted by people who were absolutely dedicated and were singing the praise of all Deities who were created by Mother Earth (Swayambhu). They sang praise of God and prayed to God Almighty in the way their gurus told them. There were also people in the middle path who were called the Nāth Pānthis, specially in Maharashtra. These were realized Souls who had received their Realization through the ``one guru, one disciple" principle. Saint Gyāneśhwara was also from the Nāth Sampradāya, meaning the Nāth Cult. He was a great exponent of Kuṇḍalinī awakening in his book."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="red">"Śhrī Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya lived in sixth century A.D. He wrote many texts: Saundaryalaharī, Upadeśhasāhasri, Vivekachūḍāmaṇi, Ātmabodh, etc. In most of these texts, there are various references to Kuṇḍalinī awakening, as some of the following stanzas [10 and 9 from Saundaryalaharī] will illustrate."</font><br />
[Having in-filled in the pathway of the nāḍīs with the streaming shower of Nectar flowing from Thy pair of Feet (Lotus Feet), having resumed Thine own position from out of resplendent lunar regions, and Thyself assuming the form of a serpent of three and a half coils, sleepest Thou in the hollow of the Kulakuṇḍa.] [Kulakuṇḍa=the hollow of the Mūlādhāra -- sacrum bone.]<br />
[Thou art diverting (residing) in secrecy with Thy Lord (the Spirit) in the thousand-petalled Lotus, having pierced through the Earth situated in Mūlādhāra, the Water in the Maṇipūra, the Fire abiding in the Swādhiṣhṭhāna, the Air in the Heart (Anāhata), the Ether above (the Viśhuddhi) and Manas between the eyebrows (Āgñyā) and thus broken the entire Kula path.]<br />
<font color="red">"Śhrī Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya propounded that it is the Kuṇḍalinī who has to be awakened and unless and until you get your Realization you are nowhere near religion. Śhrī Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya also had given a very befitting answer to the so-called proponents of Haṭha Yoga, Gyān Yoga, Karma Yoga or Rāj Yoga. "Neither by Yoga, nor philosophy, nor by work, nor by learning but by the Realization of one's identity with the Brahman is liberation possible and by no other means."</font><br />

As Last Judgment time has come. It's your wish to attain the Truth or leave it.<br />
Human beings can achieve a lot from this.<br />
First achievement is that we can feel this All-pervading Power (Paramachaitanya) on your fingers and very soothing, settle cool [not very cold] breeze flows from your fontanel bone area.<br />
Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya called it, "Salīlam, salīlam ..." The vibrations that flow through your hands, he called it, "Spand." "</font><br />

<p>
<font color="red">"I go to meet the big and great gurus and talk to them that, 'What are you doing?' By doing all this you cannot get God. You must understand by doing all this you will not get God.<br />
What I am saying? Read Vasiṣhṭha, or Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, because it is a historical thing. They have said the same thing that you get to God you cannot do anything. But there is a slight difference between them and Me that they had said that are very few who have the authority to get to God. Some should remain in bhakti and others should do some yogas so that they can keep their discipline. But they also said that a disciplined mind or a mind that is running after indulgences, both minds are useless for ascent. One has to have a mind like a small child which is without sin, and is innocent. Such a one has the right to attain God. This is what they have clearly said. But who reads them?<br />
The question is that we read a lot and we read about those who know nothing about dharma. And even if they know it is just a little bit.<br />
The ones who think they are very great Hindus they must first read Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya. Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya had established the Hindu Dharma. Then why not read Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya?<br />
You read all the books of the world, but why don't you read Him and know Him?<br />
The difference between what He said and I say is that He said that in crores there are just one or two and I say in crores, there are lākhs.<br />
......<br />
There is no need to fight with people who talk useless things. Those who want to come should come and those who don't want to come should not come. There is no time left to argue and have discussions with them, because such people will go on discussing and arguing.<br />
As Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya has said that low-level people should keep their minds disciplined and somehow live properly and protect themselves from becoming thieves, etc. They should live like good citizens."</font><br />

<font color="red">"Very few people have written about these vibrations. And the biggest wonder is that only Śhaṅkarāchārya has written about it.<br />
But those who claim themselves to be biggest Hindus do not know Śhaṅkarāchārya.<br />
Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya has talked of nothing but Sahaja Yoga.<br />
He had just said, "Na Sāṅkhyen na Yogen"</font> [an inversion of the first part of line 1 of Vivekachūḍāmaṇi 56], <font color="red">"God is not achieved either by Sāṅkhya or Yoga," He is achieved in a sahaja way, spontaneously. The growth is spontaneous and He [God] had not made any caste.<br />
He [Śhī Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya] had said that, 'There were three kind of people in the world, the one who of lower level, those who do not have much intelligence. Those who have not yet developed fully as a human being.'<br />
......<br />
Now the only difference between him [Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya] and Me is that He used to say there that there is one in millions and I say that there are thousands in millions. This is the only difference between both of us.<br />
It may be possible that there used to be such people in sixth century but as of today I see there are thousands of them who are getting this thing."</font><br />

<font color="red">"You cannot seek God through any other Yoga. 

I bow to Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, who is the eldest Son of our country: He is very big man of our country. Although, Hindu religion is very much degraded and we just could not understood what Hindu religion is all about. Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya has clearly said, "Na Sāṅkhyen na Yogen" [an inversion of the first part of line 1 of Vivekachūḍāmaṇi 56], "God can't be achieved by anything." And He also has said that there are three types of people.<br />
First types of persons are those who seek God in devotion, they do not have intelligence. They do not understand they have not yet established a connection, then how they can talk to God? They cram like mad, shouts like mad and die after getting mad. But I would have no objection if it would have stopped just here, sometimes in this madness a man gets connected to Paralok [Collective Subconscious] and bhūt vidyā, etc. enters in him. It may happen.<br />
Second type of person is a person with very sharp intelligence, very intelligent, but he has very unstable mind. He runs here and there, run this way and that way. So such a person thinks of yoga practice, so that one can control mind. This is also very wrong attitude. You cannot reach there by controlling mind. So that person controls the mind, thinks that by controlling he will reach [there]. Such disciplined mind, such mind cannot take you to God, the car in which brakes are applied cannot take you there.<br />
But from this it should not be understood that the one who is indulgent or is very voluptuous, he can reach God. He can never reach to God. But the person who leaves all these things to think that, 'I have to seek that,' and he disciplines himself too much in the name of religion, he also does not reach.<br />
Actually, we have to become, we have to just become."</font><br />

<font color="red">"The roots of Tantrism are as ancient as the awareness of religion, but it came into full force during the years 900 -- 1400 A.D. Following the Advent of Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, the great Hindu reforming Saint, or even earlier under the Emperor Aśhoka, anti-religious forces built up in India as a reaction to extreme asceticism. Jainism had reached its spiritual height through the achievements of very few adherents, and was embraced by many government ministers. They created a sense of artificial and outwardly austere asceticism. The kings, feeling oppressed by this extremely unnatural lifestyle, gave royal support to Tantrism. Later on, many other Court officials also played a great role in creating the necessary atmosphere for Tantrism's rapid spread. In retrospect, by the 6th century, absurd monastic ways of life in the three official religions, Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, made people colorless and stereotypical. Ironically, all the three religions believed in the middle Path of Righteousness. "</font><br />

I have to say that it is truly lamentable the way earnest seekers have been exploited by these horrible so-called gurus from India. For seekers are a special category of people and, as such, they are very precious. William Blake describes them as "men of God". They are the ones who have been seeking in many lifetimes to find the Divine and have often become lost in the web of words of false ideas ("śhabda jālam" in Sanskrit, as described by Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya)."</font><br />

An intellectual, one Mister Sharma, challenged him and told him that he could not do anything as an ascetic and win over my intellect. Thus he felt that for the common people all this discussion might just seem to be mental acrobatics. So he decided to write books just praising the Primordial Mother, especially in Saundaryalaharī, where he described all the Divine Vibrations as the vibrations of the loving beauty of the Primordial Mother. At that time all this was written in the Sanskrit language but the common people did not understand this language, except for a very few learned people, who also did not want to go into the details of this exposition."</font><br />

Shri Krishna, who was the greatest expression of Father God, incarnated to open another horizon in human understanding of the power of Divine Love and to watch the play of God's power as a witness. By his incarnation the human imagination was to become aware of the Great Primordial Being and therefore poets and philosophers entered the intuitive realm of metaphysical perceptions. He employed the method of Divine Diplomacy to explain the true nature of reality to people. Shri Krishna's life was spent with the masses and thus his incarnation gave rise to a mass spiritual Movement. (VIRATA) was actually expressed through Him. His disciple Arjuna saw the vision of VIRATA. For the first time human eye saw the vision of the Great Primordial Being."</font> [<b> Older Version of the last 2 sentences:</b> <font color="red">"He appeared before Arjuna as VIRATA and for the first time a human eye had the glimpse of the Primordial being."</font>]<br />
<font color="red">He played with ordinary family people of Gokul and sowed the seed of spirituality in them. (Krishna means the one who sows)<br />
How He awakened the Kund[a]lini through Sahaja Yoga in Rasa (dances) will be discussed later.<br />
In the life of Jesus Christ (incarnation of Maha Vishnu) the highest expression of the essence of spiritual innocence came on this earth. Human beings witnessed the sacrifice of the dearest and only son of the Father (Virata) for the sake of humanity. This allowed a deeper human perception for God's great love for humanity. The crucifixion of Christ happened at a time when people knew about Go almighty the Father but did not know how to crucify their human self to make the spiritual self express itself; tis is the meaning of the Resurrection of Christ by which man could be the physical witness of the immortality of the spirit which does not suffer or perish. The human awareness first time registered the truth of immortality of spirit which Krishna preached in his lifetime."</font><br />

......<br />
&emsp;<i>viii. Playful Witness</i> The Virāṭa Kṛiṣhṇa Avatāra<br />
......<br />
During the Dwāpara Yuga at the time of Lord Kṛiṣhṇa, Ādi Śhakti again incarnated as three separate human personalities, expressing Her three aspects:<br /> 
<br />
&emsp;1. Rādhā (Mahālakṣhmī) as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's first and eternal love<br />
&emsp;2. Rukmiṇī (Mahāsaraswatī) as Kṛiṣhṇa's Queen<br />
&emsp;3. Viṣhṇumāyā (Mahākālī) as sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. She lived but for a short time. She later took birth as Draupadī, wife of the Pāṇḍavas.<br />
......<br />
The ellipse now opens at its base [see {\it Figure 2}]. Viṣhṇu leaves His imprint on the parallel line as a point indicating a seat for His future highest-evolved human form as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa; Gaṇeśha, likewise, leaves the imprint of a point to demark the position reserved for His highest-evolved human form as Jesus Christ. A gap is therefore created between the Divine Form of Viṣhṇu and His human form as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, into which He has later to flower, manifesting the complete form of the Virāṭa. In precisely the same way there is a gap between the Divine Form of Śhrī Gaṇeśha and His fully evolved human form as Jesus Christ. Christ is also Mahāviṣhṇu, Son of the Virāṭa. They face each other on the two sides of the parabola.<br />
This is how Ādi Śhakti arranges the Deities in the Primordial Brain. The whole process is not a simultaneous happening, but grows gradually over countless ages as the Primordial Brain of the Virāṭa grows as a living organism. These seats are fully anointed by their respective Incarnations in the Vaikuṇṭha Stage of existence. That means that the creation of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa and Jesus Christ was conceived millions of years before they actually incarnated in human form."</font><br />
<font size="+0"><b>The Book of Ādi Śhakti, Chapter 1: Creation, the Eternal Play</b></font>
</p>

<div class="para-divider"></div>

<p>
<font color="red">"Ādi Viṣhṇu's eighth form was as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa during the Dwāpara Yuga, and again Ādi Śhakti took three forms. Mahākālī lived for a very short time as Viṣhṇumāyā, the infant sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. She was actually born as the daughter of Yeśhodā, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's foster mother, and was killed by the demon Kaṃsa. She later took birth as Draupadī, wife of the Pāṇḍavas. Yeśhodā was Herself an Incarnation of Mahāsaraswatī. As Mahālakṣhmī She took two forms, Rādhā and Rukmiṇī. '<i>Rā</i>' means power or energy and '<i>dhā</i>' means sustenance, so the name 'Rādhā' means the one who sustains the power. As Rukmiṇī She became Queen to Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, the King in Dvārakā.<br />
Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, who was the greatest expression of God the Father, incarnated to open another horizon in human understanding of the Power of Divine Love to watch the play of God's Power as a witness. By His Incarnation, human imagination was to become aware of the witnessing powers of God Almighty. The Great Primordial Being (Virāṭa) was actually expressed through Him, and His Advent enabled poets and philosophers to enter the intuitive realm of metaphysical perceptions. He employed the method, as king and diplomat, of Divine Diplomacy to explain the true nature of reality to people. The beauty of Divine Diplomacy is to achieve the spiritual betterment of people; its essence is to guide ignorant and foolish people towards the Path of Righteousness and Religion by diplomatic ways, by clever handling or by illusion. In short, such people must be brought to the shores of Divine Love 'by hook or by crook'. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's life was spent with the masses, and thus His Incarnation gave rise to a mass spiritual movement. He appeared before Arjuna as the Virāṭa, and for the first time human eyes got a glimpse of the Primordial Being Himself.<br />
In ancient times it was said that one should speak the truth (<i>satyam</i>) which is pleasing (<i>priyam</i>). Often, though, to tell the truth can hurt another's feelings. This contradictory statement was later challenged by many intellectuals. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa explained that if the object of the betterment of Spirit (<i>hita</i>) is inserted between telling the truth and pleasing or endearing, then it is possible to unobtrusively tell the truth. He meant that if truth is told for the betterment or upliftment of Spirit, ultimately it becomes an endearment and pleases the Spirit.<br />
In their early days, Rādhā and Kṛiṣhṇa played a game of <i>Rāsa</i> (<i>rā</i> + <i>sa</i> -- meaning 'with energy'). Rāsa is the play which manifests identification with the Power of God. It was the play of Sahaja Yoga, of the Divine Circuit of Vibrations. All Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's playmates were innocent, simple cow herders (<i>gopīs</i> and <i>gopas</i>). They did not know that he was trying to manifest the working of Sahaja Yoga (spontaneous growth of the inner self) through the play (<i>Līlā</i>) of Rāsa. It was a very simple game similar to 'Ring-A-Ring-A-Roses'.<br />
When Rādhā filled pitchers of water from the Yamunā River She automatically vibrated that water with Praṇava, as She was Ādi Śhakti and was carrying the water on Her head. When Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa broke the hers the vibrated water was meant to fall on the soil of Vṛindāvan where Kṛiṣhṇa and Rādhā lived, vibrating it. Similarly when Rādhā placed Her Feet in the Yamunā River, the waters of the river became vibrated. Se when the gopīs and their husbands, the simple folk of Vṛindāvan, carried water from the river in earthenware pitchers, Kṛiṣhṇa broke the pitchers so that the vibrated water would fall from their heads onto their spinal cord. Their Kuṇḍalinī would thus be awakened and raised, and they would get their Self-realization through the spontaneous awakening of Sahaja Yoga. It was sportive and playful baptism, but all these tricks or designs of Kṛiṣhṇa do not completely and immediately work out the whole manifestation of Sahaja Yoga. He could only sow the seed of Sahaja Yoga, His name meaning 'the One who sows' (<i>Kṛiṣhi</i>). The gopīs and gopas did get Kuṇḍalinī awakening which was a great achievement. The awakened state of their Kuṇḍalinī made the finite nature of human beings enlightened and enlarged their consciousness, but they still could not pierce into the infinite. That was left to be done after Kṛiṣhṇa's time, and thus awakened, their Kuṇḍalinīs needed many years of effort or many lives' experience to become receptive to Sahaja Yoga.<br />
Whilst Dattātreya's Incarnation was created in the Void, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's was at a much higher point, higher than even the Primordial Heart Chakra on which Lord Rāma took Incarnation. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's seat in the body of the Virāṭa is the Ādi Viśhuddhi Chakra, and is placed at the base of the neck inside the spinal cord. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was in fact the Complete Incarnation of the Virāṭa whose form (<i>swarūpa</i>) He showed in a vision to His disciple Arjuna. His teachings to Arjuna are compiled in the <i>Śhrī Bhagavad Gītā</i>. As the Embodiment of the Witness State He killed many male and female evil geniuses (rākṣhasas and rākṣhasīs), as Lord Rāma had done. These entities have to be killed and destroyed again and again whenever they come in the way of human evolution. Ādi Śhakti's Incarnations are also mostly to kill demons.<br />
The Incarnations of Rādhā show how the ideas of human beings gradually changed. The life as Rādhā was definitely a peg above in social advancement in the dogmatic thinking of society, compared to the time of Sītā. She was not married to Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa in a formal human way (<i>laukika</i>). Their wedding was divine (<i>alaukika</i>), and was performed spiritually and socially in the presence of many people by Brahmadeva. Earlier, as Sītā, although formally married to Rāma in a wedding ceremony that was collectively sanctioned, She was still condemned by society. Kṛiṣhṇa's love and adoration of Rādhā brought Her glory without marriage, while Sītā was denied that public acceptance even though She was the legal wife of Rāma.<br />
......<br />
Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was later very much criticized by the so-called vegetarian followers of Buddha and Mahāvīra.<br />
......<br />
The greatness of this Incarnation cannot be adequately described in words but in the <i>Devī Bhāgavatam</i> there is a passage about Christ. It tells how He was born in Heaven to Rādhā as Mahāviṣhṇu, the only Son of the Virāṭa. He is none other than Śhrī Gaṇeśha, the symbol of eternal childhood. His body was constructed from the body of Śhrī Kārttikeya who was Brahma Himself, the only brother of Śhrī Gaṇeśha, and was conceived by one-sixteenth part of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, the Virāṭa, who was His Father. As Mahāviṣhṇu He is the sustainer (<i>āśhraya</i>) of the whole world. A father always wants his son to be greater than himself, so Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa gave His Son a boon making Mahāviṣhṇu a million times greater than Himself and promising to place Him even higher than Himself. His Being would contain unlimited Brahmā, Viṣhṇu and Maheśha (Śhiva), and from His forehead Eleven Rudras would be created when the last day of destruction will come.<br />
Rādhā in Mary's Incarnation wanted to give Her Son the name of Her Lord, Kṛiṣhṇa. Kṛiṣhṇa comes from '<i>kṛiṣhi</i>' + '<i>ṇa</i>'. '<i>Kṛiṣhi</i>' means farming, '<i>ṇa</i>' means the one who carries. So the name 'Christ' came from the 'kṛiṣhi' in Kṛiṣhṇa. The name Jesus was derived from Jasodā, a form of Yeśhodā, the foster mother of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. Rādhā also wanted to give Yeśhodā's name to Her Son because of Yeśhodā's devotion and worship of Her in Vṛindāvan and Gokul. The abbreviation of Yeśhodā was 'Jesu' or 'Yesu', so Rādhā/Mary named Her Son Jesus Christ.<br />
In the life of Jesus Christ, the highest expression of the essence of spiritual innocence came onto Earth as God the Son. Human beings witnessed the sacrifice of the dearest and Only Son of the Father (Virāṭa) for humanity's sake. This allowed a deeper human perception of God's great love for the human race. The crucifixion of Christ happened at a time when people knew about God the Father, but did not know how to crucify their human self to allow the spiritual Self to express itself. This is the real meaning of the Resurrection of Christ: that man could be the physical witness of the immortality of the Spirit which does not suffer and never perishes. For the first time, human awareness registered the Truth of the immortality of Spirit which Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa had preached in His lifetime, which is recorded in the <i>Bhagavad Gītā</i> written by the poet Vyāsa.<br />
When one takes the name of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa one has to take the name of Rādhā first, so a seeker recites the mantra to the Virāṭa as 'Rādhā-Kṛiṣhṇa'. Similarly Sītā's name has to be taken before Rāma's for the mantra 'Sītā-Rāma'. Even the Virgin Mary (<i>Kanyā</i>) who was so quiet and potential at the time of Christ, was recognized later on by His disciples as the Power behind Him. She was worshiped for many years after Her death by early Christians. In modern times human beings who are satanic personalities are challenging the validity of the Primordial Mother's virginity and the Virgin Birth in particular. Mary has clearly shown the power of virginity that can raise a mother to such an exalted powerful position that she can conceive a child by desire alone. She had reached that high stage of evolution when by Her Divine Will, She could immaculately conceive. There are other such instances in Hindu purāṇik literature when Kuntī, by the wish of the Mantra, gave birth to the Pāṇḍavas and to Karṇa immaculately."</font><br />

<font color="red">"$\bullet$ They fabricated many salacious stories about Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, Śhrī Rādhā and the gopīs.<br />
......<br />
Even more cunningly competent people overturned all the age-old cultural barriers. They flouted all ideas of a sense of chastity, and claimed they were all Incarnations of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa who Himself had tried to strip the gopīs naked. Actually Lord Kṛiṣhṇa at the innocent age of five began teasing the gopīs. As a child He had no awareness of sex. When Duryodhana later tried to molest the chastity of Draupadī, Kṛiṣhṇa, then King of Dvārakā, was the first to rush to Hastināpur (near Delhi) to defend Her honor."</font><br />

These two Deities are the evolved human Incarnations of Śhrī Viṣhṇu and Śhrī Gaṇeśha respectively. After this activity the Praṇava, which has divided into three, enters the spinal cord. Its lowest strand (Mahākālī or Gaurī Power) disappears into the sacrum as Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
......<br />
These Deities also manifest Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa with His Power Rādhā, and the Lord Jesus Christ, whose Power is His Mother Mary (Mahālakṣhmī Herself). These two Deities are the evolved human Incarnations of Śhrī Viṣhṇu and Śhrī Gaṇeśha respectively.<br />
......<br />
The other Deities remain on their different centers:<br />
&emsp;1. <i>Sahasrāra chakra</i> &#8211; Ādi Śhakti Herself<br />
&emsp;2. <i>Āgñyā chakra</i> &#8211; Jesus Christ + His Mother Mary<br />

......<br />
The dangling chakra moves in a circle around the Nābhī chakra, creating an area called the Ocean of Illusion (Bhavasāgara) or the Void. Lord Viṣhṇu, through His ten Incarnations which represent the ten stages of the evolution of the Primordial Being (Virāṭa), crosses this Void. His seventh Incarnation was as Śhrī Rāma who resides on the right side of the Heart chakra with His Power, Śhrī Sītā. Rāma incarnated as the representation of a personality who was the perfect male human being (<i>Maryādā Puruṣhottama</i>). Lord Viṣhṇu's eighth Incarnation was as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa who, with His Power Rādhā, resides on the Viśhuddhi chakra. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was the ultimate expression of the Primordial Being (Virāṭa) in human form, and taught us to regard the Creation as a play (<i>Līlā</i>) of the Divine Power.<br />
In the brain above the Viśhuddhi, where the optic nerves cross each other, is the Āgñyā chakra, where Lord Jesus Christ resides in every human being. He is the complete manifestation of the Son God Principle. His body was formed from Śhrī Kārttikeya, the only brother of Śhrī Gaṇeśha and a Divine Personality. Although He came as a human being His Resurrection was made possible by the divine substance of His human body. In the Vaikuṇṭha Stage He was created as Mahāviṣhṇu, the only Son of Kṛiṣhṇa and Rādhā. As the ninth Incarnation of Viṣhṇu He was called Buddha or 'the mild Incarnation'. "</font><br />

These are the aspects of the Lord Jesus Christ: Kārttikeya becomes Christ's body; Gaṇeśha becomes Christ's essence; and Saint Gabriel and Saint Michael become angelic, the mobile aspects of Christ's attention."</font><br />

<font color="red">"When water is blessed through the presence of Divine Vibrations, the very same water can bring holiness to a person. The River Ganges which runs with Divine Water, and is the expression of the love between Rādhā and Kṛiṣhṇa, has such Divine Vibrations. If you put water from the Ganges in a bottle and leave it there for months, you will be surprised to note that there is no formation of any living organisms in it as would happen with any other water. The water remains as crystal clean as ever.<br />

The material energy of sound becomes absolutely divine only when a realized Soul creates it by percussion or by vocal means. For example, chanting mantras or talking to Deities by non-realized souls creates barriers for their communication with these Deities, who become very angry with such unauthorized practices. Human beings must understand that there is a protocol for approaching the Divine; ignorance of it is no excuse. For example, if a non-realized soul continues to chant the name of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, he may get throat problems, and ultimately even throat cancer. Sounds that are used for invoking Deities in temples, or in the worship of God by realized Souls or Yogis, are the sounds which carry or reflect Divine Vibrations. Mantras are divine sounds, and the poetic language of the Scriptures is based on the complete divine expression of the sound element. The Lord's Prayer and <i>Namas</i> are pure mantras. The Parsi <i>Avestha</i> Scriptures (of the followers of Zoroaster) and the Sanskrit <i>śhlokas</i> of the Hindus are all divine words which carry Divine Vibrations. If these words are uttered by non-realized people, they have no meaning and give no connection to God. If they are uttered by unholy people, these can fall victims to the anger of the Deities. Such individuals may fall into the subconscious or supraconscious realms. The Divine Power, the integrated energy, is expressed as the Word, also known as the Auṃ or Logos or <i>Anahalk</i>."</font><br />

<font color="red">"Then came Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa who was also born in a family not of Brahmins and not of Kṣhatriyas but of the milkmen who were not of high caste. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa himself from childhood performed so many miracles. His life displayed that the birth of a child in a particular family was not the determining factor as far as his 'jāti' or his caste was concerned. He used to go to Hastināpur and there instead of eating food or residing with people of high caste, he would live with the son of a maidservant who was Vidura, a realized Soul. Vidura was a low caste person but Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa would always go and visit and stay with him and have food in his house and not with the Kings of Hastināpur. But later on the caste system became based on the birth of a person. So the caste of a person was determined by the caste of the family in which he was born. Identification of a lower caste or a higher caste by birth was never the initial idea. Also the Goddess Durgā knew two classes, asuras or rākṣhasas (satanic) and bhaktas (devotees). It is difficult to say when Hindu society accepted this destructive caste system by birth. Perhaps some fanatic priests introduced this curse through religious books by their own alterations. This is a very common phenomenon in all the religious Scriptures where some fanatic or woman hater has put his own ideas. How can we take these Scriptures as pure or fundamental and follow them word by word?<br />
......<br />
So now we came to Jainism which has very amusing practices. First of all they want to save the lives of, in any case, all the worms, all the mosquitoes and all the bugs. It was said that they would take a hut and put a Brahmin inside that hut and they would then gather all the bugs of the village and put them also inside the same hut so that they might feed on the poor Brahmin who would suffer bug-bites for quite a while. When the bugs had completed sucking the blood of the poor Brahmin, they would get full with the blood and fall on their sides on the ground. Then only could the poor Brahmin come out of that hut. And he is given a lot of money for performing this sacrifice. I used to wonder why they used a Brahmin. Did they want Brahmin's pure blood to give spiritual life to the bugs as well? One notices so many things which are ridiculously absurd. How could they show Lord Mahāvīra like the way they show him, nude all over? Actually the story was like this. Śhrī Mahāvīra was in meditation and when he came out of that meditation half of his cloth was wrapped in a thorny bush (kunj). But he still had half his cloth upon his body. Then Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa wanted to test him. He came and asked him: "Why should you carry this piece of cloth on your body. You are a prince while I am a poor man. Why don't you give it to me." Śhrī Mahāvīra, in his generosity, gave the remaining cloth and walked into his palace which was very close by, covering himself with leaves. It was hardly for a few seconds when he had no clothes on his body. But he covered his private parts with leaves and walked inside his own palace. Now we find statues of nude Mahāvīra everywhere, with his private parts shown meticulously, as if Mahāvīra was nothing but his private parts. This really irritates any sensitive person. Why should they insult Lord Mahāvīra like this? If you notice the work of Michelangelo who has done the Sistine Chapel so well, he did not show Christ or Mother Mary or the Father, God without clothes. He showed other people, but never them. So it is very insulting to see a Great Incarnation like Lord Mahāvīra exhibited in the nude all over in India."</font><br />

<font color="red">"In Gītā there is no description of the Kuṇḍalinī or of the awakening, though Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, at the very outset, has said that a person should achieve the state of Sthitapragñya, which means, the one who is balanced, through enlightenment by Divine Knowledge. All this was a description, but he did not talk about how it is brought about."</font><br />

Specially, these are the days of your marty[rdo]m. And I know about it, everything, what had happened to Hasan and Husayn. You all have done lot of penance for Them, and are still doing it. But now the time has come for all of you to know that Their sacrifice, Their kurbānī, has been completely fulfilled. After all, what did They want? They wanted whatever Their father, ʿAlī, wanted Them to do, also Their mother Fāṭimah. But we don't know, 'Who They were? What Incarnations They were? What was Their job?'<br />
......<br />
None of these people came on this Earth to create different groups, none of Them.<br />
It was arf ... unfortunate that the Sunnis came up afterwards, and they never understood ʿAlī. According to Sahaja Yoga, ʿAlī was a very Great Incarnation.<br />
......<br />
We should understand why Muhammad Sāhab and ʿAlī worked so hard for us. What was so? What was so precious about us? They just not care for our mātam [mourning, lamentation, remembrance] but They wanted to make your life shine like a diamond, to make you Agents of the Divine so that you can transform people.<br />
......<br />
This is the experience you must have. I have to tell you the truth. This experience must be felt on your fingertips. And these fingers do not ... dunote [denote] as shown there, the different centers we have. This should happen tonight, tonight, by the grace of Muhammad Sāhab and ʿAlī. I am Their Agent, you can call Me. And that is what is My job: is to give you all you Self-realization.<br />
......<br />
According to Sahaj Yog, ʿAlī was an Incarnation on the second center.<br />
......<br />
Hazarat ʿAlī is the One who is the Incarnation of a Creator, who created the whole universe.<br />
N... now this truth can be proved! This truth can be proved! How? If you are a self-realized person, and your hands are speaking, then if you ask a question, `Was ʿAlī, Hazarat ʿAlī, was the One who created all this universe?', you start getting tremendous Cool Breeze.<br />

<font color="red">"Brahmadeva represents that aspect of God Almighty which manifests as the Creator of both the subtle side (esthetics), and of the gross side of material creation. Brahmadeva looks like an ascetic, a saintly personality, with a beard and mustache. He has four heads and all the hair on His heads is tied up in a top-knot. His body is thin with His most prominent feature being bulging and very large eyes. Brahmadeva rarely incarnates but He has incarnated once as Hazarat ʿAlī, husband of Fāṭimah and son-in-law of Muhammad Sāhib. Some ancient Sages tried to explain the meaning of His four heads as the expression of creation into four <i>Vedas</i>. The meaning of His heads is much wider and deeper, though. Brahmadeva is the symbol of the Creative Power of the Supreme, the Īśhwara, Brahma, God. This creative power is expressed through the plane of matter in this universe. All material things have three dimensions but there is a fourth dimension which only human beings can see and feel. This fourth dimension is the esthetic dimension created by balanced harmonies and the integration of different textures, forms and lines. Animals have no sense of beauty; only human beings can feel the esthetics of a composition of different colors, or the movement of lines and the melting of forms. The feelings of joy acquired through this esthetic sense create a <i>Rasa</i> (a secretion of the essence or juice of a feeling). This Rasa gives one a stimulative feeling that sets in motion waves of esthetic joy within the Inner Self. These joys are of different frequencies and vibrations. One does not need to dissect them but as I look at the different petals of this chakra, I shall try to explain the kinds of joys present in the realm of creativity expressed through divine enlightenment.

<font color="red">"Muslims who are not educated enough to understand Qur'ān in original believe that they are the soldiers of Jihād which is led by some very clever ego-oriented educated people. They have not even read the Qur'ān which was edited forty years after the death of Muhammad Sāhib. The editor himself was the most cruel man, who killed Hazarat ʿAlī, His two sons and two other Khalifas. It is said that the mother of this fifth Khalifa ate the raw liver of the fourth Khalifa. In this Jihād, how many Muslims are going to die? On one side they produce more children to create a Muslim majority and on the other side they are getting killed in thousands. The Jihād has become imminent and the Muslims are a real threat to peace and progress of every country they live in."</font><br />
