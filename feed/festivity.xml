<font color="DarkRed">"Now, when we are <b>celebrating the greatest of greatest this Navarātri</b>, there must be something special about it, that we have to cleanse this heart completely, fully and make it so pure that it purifies all the blood that passes through the whole of the body. So the cells of this heart, which has made this great organ, has to be the best, because the cells of the heart within a human body are the best cells, the highest quality, the most sensitive. And it's the heart that expresses the Anāhata, the sound that is without percussion.<br />
......<br />
...... <b>this is the highest Pūjā, the greatest ritual, which you can attend</b>. So why do we do Navarātri? In the heart, to do Navarātri is to accept the Powers of the Śhakti, to realize the power that all these chakras have got in themselves, and that when they are enlightened how you can express all these powers of these Nine Chakras within ourselves; the seven chakras plus the heart and the Moon makes it nine."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"This was a binding love. She could not escape it. <b>Mother's Love is binding. She cannot escape it. And She has to manifest it, work it out, and give that protection to all Her children.</b><br />
This protection in the modern times has taken another form.<br />
In those days, the evil was trying to harm, to destroy the people who were righteous, who were bhaktas, who were doing good things, who wanted to lead a very religious life. So <b>to save them, She incarnated. To protect them, She incarnated.</b> But they knew what was good, they knew what was wrong. And they wanted to preserve their good life, their precious life. They didn't care for money, they didn't care for power, but just they wanted their life, means they wanted to be alive to worship the Goddess. And when they were troubled or harmed or destroyed by these evil forces, She had to manifest.<br />
But in modern times, it's become very complicated, as the modern times are complicated. First of all, in the mind, in the lifestyle, in the society, of good human beings, righteous human beings, fear of the wrong has entered.<br />
Like, they are afraid, say, of their pries-sts [priests], of their churches, of their temples, of their mosques, which are all false! They are not afraid of God.<br />
They don't believe in God. They think that they have created God, and they can manage God. `So who is God?' The way they behave, you can see clearly, that they do not recognize the existence of God, God Almighty who is a wrathful God. They are not at all worried as to what will happen to them."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"So the ascent starts evolving. In that, the play of the Devī is the Navarātri -- in your ascent -- from ages. <b>Navarātri that's why is the most important Pūjā. In Sahaja Yoga, Navarātri is the most important Pūjā, I would say. Though we can say in modern Sahaja Yoga Sahasrār Day is, because that's how you started getting your Realization. But if you go to the whole historical events of evolution you'll find [that] Navarātri is the one which has brought you to Sahasrāra. Without the help of the Devī at different stages of your ascent, you could not have been in a position to receive your Realization. So all the steps that you took in the past are today worshiped and are used for thanking the Devī for what She did to bring you down here. So it's like a thanksgiving. Without Her work, nothing could have happened.</b><br />
So when we read about the Devī, about Her Incarnations -- how She came on this Earth to save Her bhaktas, people who were trying to ascend, to cross this Bhavasāgara, how She worked hard, how She fought the devils, how She cough... She killed the demons, single-handed -- She took upon Herself the responsibility of making the people cross the Bhavasāgara.<br />
<b>Guru gave you the strength to have dharma but She is the One who brought you out. Even those who were dhārmik could not do it because of the demonic pressure. She's the One who fought, single-handed, with Her Powers of destruction. In Her Love for you She fought. She brought you to this level.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"...... <b>Navarātri is very good because these nine nights represent the main Nine Incarnations</b>. Where the Goddess took the form of Śhakti and killed the negative people.<br />
But those were easier days because negativity was understood by people and nobody sympathized.<br />
So this is what one has to understand that don't sympathize with negativity. You'll spoil them all. And always you'll find such sympathies bring forth your character also that you are also slightly negative.<br />
Because to fight negativity in modern times is a very difficult task. You cannot kill anyone: if you kill somebody, then may be that such a person is a brother or a sister or something of somebody. Or such a person would be himself or herself a seeker.<br />
So best thing is to separate like a contagious disease, keep that person out, no sympathies. And get the person cured and enjoy the life, otherwise that person is not going to be helped. It has become a very individual fight. And it's so troublesome and so disgusting.<br />
So to help Me out, you should not take any sides with negativity. That's how you can help Me the most. <b>This is what it is the Navarātri, the Pūjā that I give you powers to fight the negativity. That's how you cure people.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Today is the first day of Navarātri. Today your attention should be on Śhrī Gaṇeśha.</b> His devotion is infinite. He has never worshiped anybody else except Mother. Hence He is so great. All other Gods appear very strong. Everyone has some specialty. What is Mother's specialty? Her ego (aham) is nowhere felt by others. Hence Śhrī Gaṇeśha who has surrendered to such Mother, is so wise and venerable, Mother has nothing with Her. Her very name begins with Ni, e.g., Niṣhakāñchan[ā] having no wealth, Nirlepā unaffected; Nirvichārā thoughtless; Niṣhprayojanā having no motives, Nigarvitā egoless, Niricchā desireless, etc. Therefore, surrendering to such Mother, who has nothing with Her, needs some kind of subtle thought, in that, Mother has nothing with Her and therefore, nothing can be asked from Her. It shows how Śhrī Gaṇeśha by himself, is fully satisfied. Where does this contentment of Śhrī Gaṇeśha come from? It is own power."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>On this day Devī is worshiped as Śhailaputrī, means the daughter of Himalaya.</b> Devī has many other names also but first of all She incarnated as Śhailaputrī in the cold of Himalayas. She incarnated and whatever She was to do, She started there.<br />
Further story is known to you. [King] Dakṣha did not invite Lord Śhiva in the Havana that he performed and Śhailaputrī was the consort of Lord Śhiva. She is called Satī because She entered the Holy fire of Havana and ablated Herself. But by then Lord Śhiva reached there. He lifted Her burnt up body from the fire. Burnt pieces of the body of Śhailaputrī fell at many places. All these places are considered to be Śhakti Pīṭhas, the places of worship, as there is in Vindhyāchala and many other places. Her power moves there and it is said that it Sanctifies everything.<br />
Her seventh power is considered to be the Power of Destruction. Śhakti manifested Itself on the right side as Sāvitrī and Gāyatrī but the destroying force was manifested in the center.<br />
In the form of Durgā and Her other forms manifested in Heart chakra. She is present there.<br />
If some one hurts you, confuses or disturbs you then this power will protect you and destroy your enemy."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"When He desired to create this nature, He collected a desire, we may say a wave or vibration, and filled within a container or Ghaṭ. It is that Ghaṭ. And this Ghaṭ means the God Almighty.<br />
If we can separate God Almighty and His power of desire for our understanding, then it will be easy to understand.<br />
You, people, are similar but with a slight difference. You and your desire powers are different. First, the power of your desire is born. Until you have a desire for anything, nothing is executed.<br />
This means [that] this beautiful universe is created because of someone's desire. Everything is executed after a desire. To execute the desire of God Almighty it has to be separated from Him. We will call it Ādi Śhakti.<br />
When this first stage arrived this Ghaṭasthāpanā happened. This happened so many times in ancient times and even today when we have Ghaṭasthāpanā we memorize that aboriginal happening. So on the first day of Navarātri, we do Ghaṭasthāpanā, means, remember, what an important thing it is.</b><br />
Whatever God Almighty desired at that time collected and filled in a Ghaṭ before its execution. Today we are worshiping that desire, we worshiped it today. God Almighty had that desire and brought us up to human being-ness, up to this height stage he brought us, now it is your duty to bow in front of His desire."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>But Pūjā is also an external offering. Even your heart has said so. But you should understand how you get the reward or blessings of the Pūjā and its prasād.</b><br />
A Pūjā or a prayer grows from your heart. Mantras are the words of your Kuṇḍalinī. But if Pūjā is not performed from heart or if Kuṇḍalinī is not associated with recitation of Mantras then that Pūjā becomes a ritual.<br />
If you become thoughtless in Pūjā, know that your heart is also involved in it. <b>Collect the Pūjā material and offer it sincerely. There should be no formality or bindings in the offerings.</b> It is correct to wash hands, but is your heart washed? When attention is on heart it does not go to others. Although you remain quiet from outside, you are speaking from within. Hence you should not, be silent for long time. If man's heart is not clean, then the silence becomes very harmful. At the same time loose talks can bring catastrophes.<br />
You should say the Mantras in Pūjā but with great faith (śhraddhā). There is no alternative to śhraddhā. You should perform the Pūjā when śhraddhā grows deep, so that heart itself gets all Pūjā performed."</font><br />

That's how Śhrī Gaṇeśha is so important for all the Sahaja Yogis to be understood in all its aspects, but this principle is very enormous I should say. The principle is very spread out, it's very subtle, so to understand in all its aspects is not an easy thing. The only thing you can do is to become One with it, like the Ocean.

Sahaja Yogi: Anant Chaturdaśhī.<br />
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b> Today? Ah-ah! That’s great! Yes must be. I was wondering Anant Chaturdaśhī. <b>Anant Chaturdaśhī is the day when we visarjan – dissolve Śhrī Gaṇeśha in the water.</b><br />
Gaṇeśhjī ko chodte hai na pani mein – it’s that day we put the Gaṇeśha in to the water.<br />
Because <b>He’s established for ten days and after ten days</b>, He’s born on the fourth, after ten days He’s dissolved in the water so that everywhere His Power is spread through the water.<br />
That’s why no wonder there was a Pūjā.<br />
Gaṇeśha settled down into the water. That is Ananta Chaturdaśhī. Ananta is the, is Śhrī Gaṇeśha.<br />
Ananta means which cannot be destroyed. Innocence cannot be destroyed. And that is why is the Gaṇeśh Chaturdaśhī means the day when Gaṇeśha is dissolved in the water, in the ocean or He is created, worshiped for ten days and again given back. So it’s a very great day today, I should say, like the Resurrection of Christ that you are, you had Christ here, He lived with you, and then went back to His Father. Father is the ocean and that’s what in India they do, <b>establish Him on the fourth day and on the tenth day they put Him back to the ocean</b>."</font><br />

The first Deity that was created by the Ādi Śhakti was Śhrī Gaṇeśh, because it was necessary first to create the Deity of Principles.</b> The Deity of Principle in the sense that whatever is created, whatever is there, has [been] called bhava, whatever has been so far created up to human level, everything, had to be through the implanted mechanism of energy.

<font color="DarkRed">"Gaṇeśh is the first Deity that got established and similarly the situation of Gaṇeśh is same as that of Mahākālī. This is the seed and the whole world emanates from this seed and again gets merged with it. Similarly, everything after emanating from the Gaṇeśh Tattwa merges with Gaṇeśh Tattwa itself. Whatever exists, Gaṇeśh is the seed of that. Whatever appears in front of us, in action, in desire, Gaṇeśh is the seed of it. That is why Gaṇeśh is considered the foremost main Deity.<br />
Not only that, without worshipping Śhrī Gaṇeśh, we cannot do any work. Then they may be Śhaiva [Śhaivites], may be Vaiṣhṇav, may be devotees of Śhrī Brahma or anybody else, all of them first worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha. The reason for this is that Śhrī Gaṇeśh Tattwa was established by God Almighty as the first thing in this Universe.<br />
The Gaṇeśh Principle is what we call as abodhita [ignorant of wrong behavior] or what we call as innocence in English. This is a very subtle principle. We do not understand it. In childhood it exists in the children, everywhere we see its expression, its fragrance, wafting all over -- that is why small children are so lovable -- such is the Principle of Innocence. It is present in Śhrī Gaṇeśha."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Today, we are going to worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha.<br />
As you know, in the whole of Europe, America, England, they have lost faith in Śhrī Gaṇeśha. Nor do they care for His Powers and for His blessings. As result, all His blessings are not on these countries.<br />
<b>The first blessing of Śhrī Gaṇeśha, which is, I think is the highest, is the wisdom</b>, that we learn what is good for us and what is bad for us, what is constructive and what is destructive, what should we do to achieve our Self-realization. Those people who have got wisdom are very lucky people.<br />
But wisdom comes from no source but your own understanding of life."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the Deity of Innocence.</b><br />
When we are born as children, it is Śhrī Gaṇeśha who is acting and we are very innocent, and it is such a powerful thing that, with this innocence, children survive under many circumstances. And we love them, because they are innocent. We enjoy them, because they are innocent.<br />
Once we start growing, our Sahasrāra also gets closed and we develop all kinds of funny things that enters into us and doesn't go out. It's just there, it doesn't go out.<br />
Innocence has a great effect on our character and on our sense of chastity. Actually, when you are innocent, you don't know what is not chastity, what is being unchaste, what is being cunning. You are innocent and you are looked after by Śhrī Gaṇeśha Himself."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Today, we have gathered here to worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha.<br />
<b>You all know what a powerful Deity He is. His Power comes from His innocence.</b><br />
When we see small children, we [are] automatically compelled towards them and also we want to love them, kiss them and be with us [them]. And very innocent they are, extremely innocent.<br />
And when we worship Śhrī Gaṇeśh we have to know if we have been really innocent or not."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Innocence is the sustainance [sustenance], is the basis of spirituality. If a person doesn't have innocence, we [he] cannot rise in spirituality.<br />
That's why the first job of Sahaja Yoga is to establish Śhrī Gaṇeśha within you, to awaken Him. As soon as the Kuṇḍalinī awakens, you must know that Śhrī Gaṇeśha comes into being. Without His awakening within you, Kuṇḍalinī cannot be raised. But it could be temporary, or it could be a permanent thing.<br />
It could be very temporary with people who are not yet adjusted to the new method or to the Ways of God's Love. Those who have not understood, or those who have not gone through those traditions, is rather difficult for them to establish Śhrī Gaṇeśha within them. "</font><br />

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the first Deity that was created so that the whole Universe is filled with auspiciousness, with peace, bliss, and spirituality. He is the Source. He's the Source of Spirituality. As a result of that all other things follow. Like when it rains and is windy you feel a coolness in the atmosphere. In the same way when Śhrī Gaṇeśha emits His Power we feel all these three things within and without. But it has been so unfortunate, specially in the West, that the most important fundamental Deity has been completely not only neglected, but insulted and crucified.<br />
So today though I did not want to say anything to upset you people, but I must tell you that worshiping Śhrī Gaṇeśha means there has to be a thorough cleansing within you. When you worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha keep your mind clean, keep your heart clean, keep your being clean -- no thoughts of lust and greed should come up. Actually when the Kuṇḍalinī rises Gaṇeśha had to be awakened within us, the innocence has to come up -- which obliterates all such degrading ideas within us. If ascent has to be achieved, we have to understand that we have to mature."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Now look at Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa as a child: how innocent He was, and how powerful! He wanted to eat the butter. Now why He wanted to eat the butter because all the butter that was made in Gokul, in that place, was sent to Mathura where this horrible King Kaṃsa was ruling. And all his military people became very strong by eating that butter. So He didn't want them to eat the butter, so He started a kind of a tribe of small children and a game that they climb on top of each other. And the butter was kept in a pot hanging from the roof, so they would go and eat all that up. In that little childhood He started this innocent play, so all the children used to climb up and eat the butter. So now there's no butter left, so how will they take it to Mathura? This was done and one day His mother caught hold of Him.<br />
She said, "Did You eat any butter from here?" All butter was here all around. He said, "How? How can I eat the butter? See, can I reach My hand there? See now, how can I ..." "Oh, so You took the stick and broke it?" "No, no, I did not." "Then what is all this?" "See, these are all My friends who ate it. I put it on My mouth so that you can beat Me." So innocently talking like an ordinary child, this One, an ordinary, simple child. So Mother said, "All right. Let Me see Your mouth."<br />
He opens the mouth and She sees the complete, She sees the complete universe, complete universe revolving into His mouth.<br />
And She sees it. And She says, "Oh Lord, please forgive Me. I forgot! I really forgot that You are the Lord of this universe and I am doubting You!" She just fell at His feet. "There must be some play in what You're doing." In a simple, innocent way like a child would say He told the Mother.<br />
So the innocence of a child and the innocence of a virgin, or you can say the chastity of a virgin and innocence of a child brought forth, brought forth the existence of America."</font><br />

We have to understand clearly that Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa is a very-very important Deity within us. Because He is the Viṣhṇu, who resides in the Void, in the Nābhī. He is the One who generates dharma within us.<br />
When you got your Realization I didn't tell you, 'Don't do this,' 'Don't do that.' I never told you that, 'This is not good, 'That is not good.' You just did it, because Śhrī Viṣhṇu was awakened within you.<br />
He is in the Void, and if He is awakened, He brings you to the light: removes your ignorance, removes your darkness, and you start seeing that whatever you were doing was destructive for you. And that's how the dharma is established. Of course, the dharma was established also by all the Ten's Gurus who came on this Earth, the Prophets, who taught us about dharma."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So Kṛiṣhṇa was a[n] Incarnation of Diplomacy, I must say, Divine Diplomacy, because He knew about the human brain, and He knew how to put it forward.</b> So He said, "All right, you do all your karmas, and put it at the Lotus Feet of the Lord," which cannot be, it's not possible. We may mentally think, "Oh, I'm doing all for God's sake I'm doing this." That's just our imagination. But you just don't do it, because the karma has to become akarma, means 'non-action' -- that's only possible when you get your Self-realization. When a self-realized Soul gives you Kuṇḍalinī, he doesn't say -- raises your Kuṇḍalinī, doesn't say, 'I do it.' He says, "It's rising, it's going, it's working out." In the third person he talks, so the whole thing becomes akarma.<br />
Then He says that, "Whatever are the flowers and things like that you give Me," that's the Bhakti Yoga, "I'll take it."

<font color="blue">"So this Viśhuddhi on the right-hand side is to be controlled by surrendering as it is said, actually you surrender your ego to begin with. And this ego when you surrender, it has to be done from you heart, it should not be a lip service. From your heart: "I don't want this ego any more, I want reality. Let the reality be seen by me, felt by me, enjoyed by me." And once you start doing it from your heart you'll be amazed that your voice will become sweet. Apart from that it will have the Divine Power flowing through it. That is what we say that you have now got Vāk Śhakti, means 'the Power of Speech'.<br />
So when you surrender ego, what do you do actually is to say that, "I'm not doing anything, it is You who do everything." So that a little drop has now become an Ocean. And so, your sound has got the Power of the Ocean."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"So the main Principle of Kṛiṣhṇa was collectivity -- Rāsa -- everybody one with the energy; energy circulates through everyone, and just the opposite that the country developed into individualism and everything was to create something that collective was not. Individualism, when it is not connected to the mains, is destruction. Like all these trees you see, they are individuals as you see them separate, but inside they are fed by the same Mother [Earth]. They have the same sap running in them. When this connection is broken, then all this individualism is nothing but destruction and that's how in America the connection with the collectivity was broken by every sort of funny methods that one cannot conceive how human beings can go to that level."</font><br />

Today is the Full Moon Day, and this day what we do is to tie a band of threads around the person whom you want to protect. But it is done between brothers and sisters.</b> The sisters tie this bondage to the wrist of the brothers, and when they do that, they are putting all their love around the wrist, that it is the day for giving all their love, everything to their brother, as a protection, as a symbol of their protection through that thread. Is a very, very simple thread they use. And uh this is, has to be tied on the left-hand side. But people tie it on the right-hand side, which is a mistake.

<font color="DarkRed">"So the relationship between Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa and Viṣhṇumāyā is that of a brother and a sister.<br />

So now here we are celebrating actually the Deity which is the Sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br />
Later on She was born as Draupadī. And that's why Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa went to save Her chastity, because is the brother only who is concerned about the chastity and the name of the sister."</font><br />

O Divine Mother, You are verily the One who gives chastity, the Foundation of all dharmas.<br />
Salutations to You!<br />
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now Viṣhṇumāyā's Power is very important to understand, because Mother Power is to protect your innocence, because that is the most important thing. To protect your innocence is the Mother's Power.</b> Now, Viṣhṇumāyā's Power is to protect your chastity. You don't understand sometimes what is chastity and what is innocence. Innocence is a power which is not acted upon. Like we have electricity in our house, the electricity exists like innocence exists within us; but enactment of that is done through chastity. A person can say, 'I did this very innocently' -- no, he cannot. Because whatever you do if it is innocent, cannot be harmful to your character, to your innocence or to your righteousness.<br />
So those people who say like this, that, 'I did it innocently,' are wrong, because innocently if you do anything it becomes chastity. So when innocence is practiced it becomes chastity. You must have respect of your chastity. <b>Chastity is the one which is Viṣhṇumāyā's Power within us, Gaurī's Power, is the pure virgin.</b><br />
......<br />
Now to understand the significance of chastity within us, we have to know that <b>chastity is the foundation of all dharmas</b>. Unless and until you have sense of chastity you cannot have dharma. Dharma is not possible because that's the foundation. It will be a house of cards; if you do not have the foundation of chastity it will just collapse in no time."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now our Viṣhṇumāyā Principle is to be always kept very alert because it helps us in many ways.</b> First of all it helps us to pass the messages from your heart to your head. It is the one by which we integrate. Our heart and head is integrated by the Viṣhṇumāyā Principle more than the Viśhuddhi on the right side.<br />
Viśhuddhi on the right side can create collectivity, can create understanding with each other but on the left side it helps you to keep a complete integration between your heart and your head.<br />
If there is a guilt you just think of it and analyze it. It means that there's a struggle between you in your heart and your mind, isn't it? Simple as that. If it was integrated you would not feel guilty. And that is why all these artificial theories that have come, all these artificial yarns that you have read and all that, you forget it.<br />
<b>You are a Sahaja Yogi and you have entered into the Kingdom of God -- enjoy! That's all you have to do. But you have to get to that state of enjoyment and understanding that you are above all.</b>"</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So now here Viṣhṇumāyā is the One who is the virgin. Not only that She is a virgin, but She exist[s] in all the five elements, as shown that She [Śhrī Draupadī] married five Pāṇḍavas. And that, this power of virginity in Her, used to expose people to the dangers of these horrible Kauravas who were going to rule and destroy the dharma. See, so She stood back. And She is the one who said that, "You have to fight. You have to fight for dharma, whatever may happen."<br />
And Kṛiṣhṇa always supported Her. So, as a brother, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa supported Her.<br />
So the relationship between brother and sister are very important, in India. Also should be with Sahaja Yogis, because we have Rākhī Bandhan. You also have what you call the Bhāī Dūj, where on Diwālī Day we tie up a rākhī to the brother.<br />
<b>Now this rākhī is nothing but the Viṣhṇumāyā's Power, which protects the brother. Actually, there the brother [Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa] protected Her, and now the sister's love protects the brother.<br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So, this day is uh extremely important, in a way, for Sahaja Yogis to observe, and I'm happy that I am here, because it's very important also for America.</b><br />
Uh as I told you that, I have already talked to you how the-ee war between Alexander and Puru's was finished because of a sister's intervention.<br />
And, also, how Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, whose sister was Draupadī, Viṣhṇumāyā was born as Draupadī, and how He came to save Her chastity, by rushing all the way from Dvārika.<br /> 
So, we can see that when we ascend in the Collective Consciousness and we have collective living, collective meeting, at the Viśhuddhi chakra, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa establish[ed] this, or He manifested uh this pure relationship of a sister.<br />
In a collective life that we have, in the Āśhram where we live, where we move about as Sahaja Yogis, if we do not have this basic principle within us, there will be a chaos, complete chaos. Once this purity of relationship is established, that apart from my wife, all the rest are my sisters or mothers, it cannot be a proper society and <b>the chaos of the social system of America is because they have no sense of pure relationships.<br />
Once you call somebody a sister, she's a sister. And once you call somebody a brother, she's [he's] a brother. It's not only that you should be born of the same parents, it's not necessary, but this is a very important principle to have a very pure society where everybody can live peacefully.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">Many blessings,<br />
Received your rākhīs conveying your deep love. Rākhī is Protecting Power. Its bond is very strong and extremely tender because it symbolizes the noble love of sister. Customarily, <b>tying a rākhī to someone is establishing a place of Pure Protection</b>. However, man's ability to understand love has become so feeble that tying of rākhī has become merely a mechanical process. All beautiful human traditions become lifeless and dry formalities if there is no warmth of faith in them.<br />
......<br />
<b>Rākhī Pūrṇimā is a day of great significance. On that day you should ask for perfection, make big decisions and keep attention on high ideals.</b> Sahaja Yogis should not destroy their attention on trifle issues. Lot of work has yet to be done. Those Sahaja Yogis who have progressed should get busy. New centers should be opened. People should be cured of their diseases and their attention should be drawn towards God-realization.<br />
Please show this letter to all Sahaja Yogis.<br />
Always remembering you<br />
<b>-- Your Mother Nirmalā</b></font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is a day peoples ... this is created by human beings and not by God, as Guru Pūrṇimā. Because as God has created days of Their advent, human beings have created days of their surrendering.</b> So this is the day when you have to give something to the Guru, and Guru does not have to give anything to you. This is the time you have to say: `What you are going to give? What you are going to do for your Guru?' Because so far the Guru has been giving.<br />
If you are in meditation, supposing you say, `We'll meditate because Guru Pūrṇimā is there,' that's not the way the Guru Pūrṇimā is to be celebrated. Because if you meditate, you are taking from Me. If you try to correct yourself, you are taking from Me. If you are going to get cured, you are taking from Me.<br />
So now what can you do for Me? Is the point, you have to think about it. `What can you do?'<br />
Now I have sent the same question to India, to find ... I asked them to find out: `What can you do for Me?'<br />
You will say: `Mother, what can we do? After all, what are we?' That's a way of evading the issue.<br />
But if you really want to see, <b>you can do a lot. And that is what it is that: you are My witness. You are My publicity!</b><br />
So, today you have to take some vows. And you have to say: that, `We are going to do these things. We are going to talk about Sahaj Yog, we are going to propagate it, we are going to spread it. And what may come, we are going to surrender ourselves to Mother. Even, if She's supposing, scolds us, or says anything it is for our good. And we are not going to get confused.' And that's how you have to <b>absolutely vow that you are going to dedicate yourself to Sahaj Yog to help others, to e... emancipate, and to create atmosphere for the completion of this universe, of this creation, for that fruitful day when we will say: that the Kingdom of God has been brought on this Earth.<br />
So today is not the day for Me to give, but for you. You have to announce.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is the day of Guru Pūrṇimā. It is a Full Moon Day. That's why ... it is called as Pūrṇimā. The guru has to be like a Full Moon. Means completely grown, completely matured.</b><br />
There are sixteen kalās or the phases of the Moon, and when the complete Pūrṇimā comes in, the Full Moon Day, all the sixteen kalās are completed. You also know that in the Viśhuddhi chakra there are sixteen sub-plexuses. When Kṛiṣhṇa is described as Virāṭa, He's called as the Sampūrṇa, the Complete Incarnation of Viṣhṇu's aspect, because He's got the sixteen phases completely done.<br />
So today's number is sixteen. Six plus one: seven.<br />
Now we have to understand the importance of guru. <b>Why should we have a guru when we have God?</b> We've got Śhakti, then why should we have a guru? <b>What is the need to have a guru?</b><br />
Guru means the weight, the weight. We get our weight from the magnetic forces of the gravity of the Mother Earth. So, guru means gravity: the gravity in a person.<br />
<b>Why do we need a guru?</b><br />
Because to know God is easy, specially in Sahaja Yoga, to be one with Him. As soon as you get your Self-realization in Sahaja Yoga, the modern Sahaja Yoga, immediately you become entitled to give Realizations to other people.<br />
It was said that, ``Guru is the person who makes you meet the Divine." But's not true. Because any self-realized person, in the Sahaja Yoga, can raise the Kuṇḍalinī and king ... can give Self-realization to others, immediately after they have touched the Sahasrāra or opened the Sahasrāra. But normally a realized Soul cannot do it. Any born realized Soul cannot do it on its own: it has to have authority of Me, as I am today.<br />
That's why it was said that, ``Guru is a person who makes you meet God": he raises the Kuṇḍalinī and makes you one with God."</font><br />

And because of their Self-realization, as they had, they have so much of knowledge. And that is what they tried to impart to people.<br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Sahaja Yoga is very different from all other gurus that we believe in the Power of Love. Power of Love teaches you how to be forgiving, it makes you noble, it makes you very balanced.</b><br />
So, the gurus who were there for Bhavasāgara, to establish dharma in the human beings, first thing, they had to balance themselves against all practical things, as they call it. They think is not practical! But they said, ``No! For us, this is higher, nobler and important." <b>So they would balance people because they had this Power of Love within themselves. All these Ādi Gurus and Their Incarnations, if you see Them, They always had balance and always prayed ... praised the Love of God.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we are going to do the Pūjā of Ādi Śhakti.</b><br />
It's a difficult subject uuh to talk about Ādi Śhakti, because is not easy to understand that Ādi Śhakti is the Power of Sadāśhiva. Sadāśhiva is the God Almighty. She is His breath, as they some people call it. <b>Some say She is the Desire and some say that She's the Entire Power of Sadāśhiva and Sadāśhiva cannot do anything without Her Powers.</b><br />
......<br />
The first thing is, we must know, that She created a Kuṇḍalinī in the Mother Earth Itself and She created Śhrī Gaṇeśha out of the Mother Earth, it's very interesting.<br />
So, the Mother Earth becomes a very important thing for us. If we do not know how to respect the Mother Earth, we do not know how to respect ourselves.<br />
The expression of Ādi Śhakti within you is the Kuṇḍalinī, no doubt. That is the reflection of Ādi Śhakti in you. But the reflection in the Mother Earth is also expressed, as you all know, in different places, different countries, different cities as the manifestation of chakras and Ādi Śhakti's creations. It was very important first to create a very holy Mother Earth for human beings to be born on them [it]. So the reflection of the Ādi Śhakti as Kuṇḍalinī first was on the Mother Earth.<br />
Kuṇḍalinī is a, we should say, is a wee part of the Ādi Śhakti. <b>Or we can say that She is the desire, pure desire of the Ādi Śhakti. So Ādi Śhakti is the desire, complete desire of Sadāśhiva, and Kuṇḍalinī, Ādi Kuṇḍalinī, is the desire, complete desire of Ādi Śhakti.</b>"</font><br />

As you know that: Ādi Śhakti has Her own Kuṇḍalinī, which is the Ādi Kuṇḍalinī, and the reflection of that, within you, is the Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
So you have to worship. And is the best way to please your own Kuṇḍalinī, your own mother, who has given you this birth."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we have gathered here to do the Kuṇḍalinī Pūjā, or the Ādi Śhakti Pūjā.</b><br />
There's a difference between the two: <b>Ādi Śhakti is the Total Power of God, of His Desire, while [Ādi] Kuṇḍalinī is the One that is reflected, part which is reflected in the human beings as Kuṇḍalinī.</b> So there's a difference between the Ādi Kuṇḍalinī and the Ādi Śhakti.<br />
<b>Ādi Śhakti is the Parāśhakti, is the Power which is beyond all the powers, which controls all the powers. And one of the powers of Ādi Śhakti is Kuṇḍalinī.</b><br />
For example, the Kuṇḍalinī which is placed within Me, in the triangular bone, is not [the] totality of Me. In the same way, the Kuṇḍalinī, which is placed within you, is not the totality. Of course, It is the power which is there to give you your Self-realization. Is the power that redeems you, that nourishes you, that enlightens your centers.<br />
But there are two other powers, as you know, very powerful, which are working through Iḍā and Piṅgalā. And the third one is Mahālakṣhmī which is in the center. "</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So, in that reflection that you are Me, in that rekflection [reflection] that the Mother Earth is Me</b>, in that beautiful creation within you, you have to become very sensitive to the need of the world, what is the need of the world. <b>Today, if you fail, the whole thing will fail forever.</b> Only very few will be there. So the need for you is: to spread Sahaja Yoga because this love is not only for you. Is not to be enjoyed [only] by you, but is to be enjoyed by as many possible in the whole world.<br />
<b>So, today we have to decide that, as the children of Ādi Śhakti, we have to go all out, everywhere, every corner, we have to shout and we have to tell loudly what is the time in which we are living and what is the responsibility that you have to fulfill as Sahaja Yogis.</b>"</font><br />

......<br />
So this Ādi Śhakti's Love is something so, so subtle, is so subtle. You cannot understand sometimes. I know you all love Me very much. It's tremendous love for Me, and when I get the vibrations from you, it is like the ripples that reach the shores and again they return back and lots of little, little sparkling drops are there, on the shore also. In the same way in My heart I feel your love echoing the beauty of this Divine Love ... which I cannot la explain to you the experience that it creates.

Love is the expression that you are all there. That is why to be one with Her one should learn to love.<br />
Of course in that you have to know that you should forgive. If you don't know how to forgive and find mistakes of other people you won't help. What is your now job is, is to see that you are loving, no hatred for anyone, you don't think of hating anyone and hitting somebody.<br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we are all going to worship Me, first time. It has been always the Pūjā of [an] aspect of Me or a part of Me.</b><br />
Now, one has to know very clearly what is Ādi Śhakti. As we say, is the Pure Desire of God Almighty, of Sadāśhiva. But what is the pure Desire of God Almighty?<br />
If you see your own desires, come out of what? Not out of the Divine Love but out of carnal love, out of material love, of out of power love. Behind all these desires there is love.<br />
If you do not love something you will not desire it. So, these mundane types of love that you have, for which we spend so much of our time uselessly, actually they do not give you satisfaction, because that is not true love that you have. Just infatuation for the time being, and then you just get fed up with it, and from there you jump to another thing, to another thing, to another thing.<br />
So <b>Ādi Śhakti is the Embodiment of God's Divine Love, is God's Pure Love, and in His Love what did He desire? He desired that He should create human beings, who would be very obedient, would be sublime, would be like angels. And that was His idea: to create Adam and Eve.</b>"</font><br />

Because when the enthusiastic Deities start emitting vibrations with your im... asking. Because you are Saints, so They just, They are overenthusiastic. And They are sitting there, busybodies, you know [soft laughter]. They are sitting quietly waiting for a chance, you see, to emit vibrations, to save you, you see, They want to just rush. They emit so much [laughing:] that They lose, 'Just wait, just wait.' They want to save you, They want to give you, They're so anxious, in Their anxiety to save you. I like it, to see the way They are anxious. But [laughs] ... but you don't suck it and I have a problem there. Once They've given They don't want to take it back. You don't suck it, so it has to go to the atmosphere, it has to disappear somewhere. Is directed towards you and you don't take it, so where does it go? It hangs into My tissues, it pains Me.<br />
So, sucking should be more. Sucking should be more. <b>And just before the Pūjā you should say: 'Mother, make me such that I suck more of the Divine!' Just pray that, with sincerity from your heart, just say that.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"It's nice today it's Mother's Day, and You find so many people waiting for You.<br />
And also You see Yourself as a Mother, the heart which is pining to meet, then You can't get out of some things. And then You enjoy that pining, that longing to see Your own, Your own children whom You love so much. Is such a great joy.<br />
In these modern times, it is described that in this Kali Yuga everything will go upside down because people will not recognize the motherhood. The mothers won't be respected and won't be respectable either. Is a fact.<br />
And imagine now this has brought this Mother's Day to this country. It's something, such a recognition from the Divine that one has to remember that motherhood is very important.<br />
......<br />
<b>So the power that your Mother has, of giving birth, the spiritual birth, be bestowed upon all of you so that you do this work with the same grace and with the same patience and love and enjoyment.<br />
May God bless you.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"[Mother's is] a very special institution ...... especially in this country [Italy], they have such respect for their mothers.<br />
<b>Mother is the Source of Love.</b> In the Qur'ān they asked Muhammad Sāhab whom should we bow after Allah? So He said "to Mother" -- "to the Mother."<br />
Then again they asked Him, He said: "Only the Mother." Again they asked Him, He said: "Only the Mother."<br />
I'm sure He must have said about the Divine Mother, because worldly mothers may not be complete mothers, perhaps. They are a[n] embodied, or, we can say, examples of Mother's Love, of the Divine Mother's Love, but they are human.<br />
So they can be conditioned, influenced or could be egoistical, especially if they are living in a particular country for a long time and have no idea of Divine Love.<br />
<b>In Divine Love there is no expectations, it just flows, it doesn't think how to judge a person or what to do for a person, it just flows.</b>"</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Today is ... I like the day when it is the Mother’s, I should say, Mother’s Day also. Because I think only a Mother can work it out that way. One has to have a lot of patience with people.<br />
.......<br />
But mother’s position is different. She’ll go on struggling and fighting for her child. She’ll fight it out to the last to see that the child gets all the benefits and this patience and this love and this forgiveness is innately built-in in a mother, because her attitude is very different. Not any achievement, not any big name or what you call a sort of an award or anything. It is just she does it because she is a mother. And that is what is the sign of any mother, if she is a real mother, at least for her own children, she will go all out, she will work out everything for day in day out and to save the child from disaster. But Sahaja Yoga is a much bigger family and for that you really had to be worked out through the Mother’s Principle. You cannot take any other principle.<br />
......<br />
So, in your own way, when you are doing Sahaja Yoga, there also you have to be a mother. <b>More mother’s quality than the father’s quality, that there’s no ambition, there’s no competition, there’s no jealousies, nothing.</b> Just you want your children to come up and to grow into their spirituality. If that is the only attitude we have then you’ll be amazed how satisfied you’ll feel, because this is a very, very joy-giving thing, to see people growing in spirituality. Not only talking about it, not only reading about it, but actually happening, actualizing within yourself. So this quality is very helpful and that really helps every Sahaja Yogi to be patient, to be kind, to be humble."</font><br />
