<font color="DarkRed">"So the relationship between Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa and Viṣhṇumāyā is that of a brother and a sister.<br />
And surprisingly, the other day we celebrated the Rākhī Bandhan, the Rakṣhābandhan, which is the same thing as the brothers-sisters relationship.<br />
So now here we are celebrating actually the Deity which is the Sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br />
Later on She was born as Draupadī. And that's why Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa went to save Her chastity, because is the brother only who is concerned about the chastity and the name of the sister."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Rākhī is Protecting Power.</b> Its bond is very strong and extremely tender because it symbolizes the noble love of sister. Customarily, tying a rākhī to someone is establishing a place of Pure Protection. However, man's ability to understand love has become so feeble that tying of rākhī has become merely a mechanical process. All beautiful human traditions become lifeless and dry formalities if there is no warmth of faith in them.<br />
......<br />
<b>Rākhī Pūrṇimā is a day of great significance. On that day you should ask for perfection, make big decisions and keep attention on high ideals.</b> Sahaja Yogis should not destroy their attention on trifle issues. Lot of work has yet to be done."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Today in India, we celebrate a set ... special festival. <b>It is called as Rakṣhā-bandhan. Rakṣhā means protection and bandhan means the bondage: the bondage of protection. Is a very nice, good, social custom to have this beautiful festival today.</b><br />
<b>Today is the Full Moon Day, and this day what we do is to tie a band of threads around the person whom you want to protect.</b> But it is done between brothers and sisters. The sisters tie this bondage to the wrist of the brothers, and when they do that, they are putting all their love around the wrist, that it is the day for giving all their love, everything to their brother, as a protection, as a symbol of their protection through that thread. Is a very, very simple thread they use. And uh this is, has to be tied on the left-hand side. But people tie it on the right-hand side, which is a mistake. But it has to be tied on the left-hand side."</font><br />

<font color="blue">"<b>So, this day is uh extremely important, in a way, for Sahaja Yogis to observe, and I'm happy that I am here, because it's very important also for America.</b><br />
Uh as I told you that, I have already talked to you how the-ee war between Alexander and Puru's was finished because of a sister's intervention.<br />
And, also, how Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, whose sister was Draupadī, Viṣhṇumāyā was born as Draupadī, and how He came to save Her chastity, by rushing all the way from Dvārika.<br />
So, we can see that when we ascend in the Collective Consciousness and we have collective living, collective meeting, at the Viśhuddhi chakra, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa establish[ed] this, or He manifested uh this pure relationship of a sister.<br />
In a collective life that we have, in the Āśhram where we live, where we move about as Sahaja Yogis, if we do not have this basic principle within us, there will be a chaos, complete chaos. Once this purity of relationship is established, that apart from my wife, all the rest are my sisters or mothers, it cannot be a proper society and <b>the chaos of the social system of America is because they have no sense of pure relationships.<br />
Once you call somebody a sister, she's a sister. And once you call somebody a brother, she's [he's] a brother. It's not only that you should be born of the same parents, it's not necessary, but this is a very important principle to have a very pure society where everybody can live peacefully.</b>"</font><br />

Now, left Viśhuddhi is the place where our relationship of brothers and sisters exist. When they are disturbed within us, we start getting the problem of the left Viśhuddhi.<br />
In these modern times, to talk of pure relationship seems to be quite boring for many people. But is very practical and logical. I would say it is the most scientific thing to do.<br />
For example, every brother has a special feeling for a sister, and her chastity is very dear to every brother, if he is a normal person. If he's abnormal, then forget it. But normally, a brother is very particular about the chastity of the sister, and he doesn't like anybody to, in any way, even pass a remark against the chastity of a sister."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is the day of Guru Pūrṇimā. It is a Full Moon Day. That's why ... it is called as Pūrṇimā. The guru has to be like a Full Moon. Means completely grown, completely matured.</b><br />
There are sixteen kalās or the phases of the Moon, and when the complete Pūrṇimā comes in, the Full Moon Day, all the sixteen kalās are completed. You also know that in the Viśhuddhi chakra there are sixteen sub-plexuses. When Kṛiṣhṇa is described as Virāṭa, He's called as the Sampūrṇa, the Complete Incarnation of Viṣhṇu's aspect, because He's got the sixteen phases completely done.<br />
So today's number is sixteen. Six plus one: seven.<br />
Now we have to understand the importance of guru. Why should we have a guru when we have God? We've got Śhakti, then why should we have a guru? What is the need to have a guru?<br />
Guru means the weight, the weight. We get our weight from the magnetic forces of the gravity of the Mother Earth. So, guru means gravity: the gravity in a person.<br />
Why do we need a guru?<br />
Because to know God is easy, specially in Sahaja Yoga, to be one with Him. As soon as you get your Self-realization in Sahaja Yoga, the modern Sahaja Yoga, immediately you become entitled to give Realizations to other people.<br />
It was said that, "Guru is the person who makes you meet the Divine." But's not true. Because any self-realized person, in the Sahaja Yoga, can raise the Kuṇḍalinī and king ... can give Self-realization to others, immediately after they have touched the Sahasrāra or opened the Sahasrāra. But normally a realized Soul cannot do it. Any born realized Soul cannot do it on its own: it has to have authority of Me, as I am today.<br />
That's why <b>it was said that, "Guru is a person who makes you meet God": he raises the Kuṇḍalinī and makes you one with God.</b><br />
Because in those days when the gurus were self-realized, ...... when the gurus were self-real... -realized, they had the authority and power of raising the Kuṇḍalinī only after they had reached a very great state of evolution: complete purification, complete detachment."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Today is a day people's ... this is created by human beings and not by God, as Guru Pūrṇimā. Because as God has created days of Their advent, human beings have created days of their surrendering. So this is the day when you have to give something to the Guru, and Guru does not have to give anything to you. This is the time you have to say: 'What you are going to give? What you are going to do for your Guru?' Because so far the Guru has been giving.<br />
If you are in meditation, supposing you say, 'We'll meditate because Guru Pūrṇimā is there,' that's not the way the Guru Pūrṇimā is to be celebrated. Because if you meditate, you are taking from Me. If you try to correct yourself, you are taking from Me. If you are going to get cured, you are taking from Me.<br />
So now what can you do for Me? Is the point, you have to think about it. 'What can you do?'<br />
Now I have sent the same question to India, to find ... I asked them to find out: 'What can you do for Me?'<br />
You will say: 'Mother, what can we do? After all, what are we?' That's a way of evading the issue.<br />
But if you really want to see, <b>you can do a lot. And that is what it is that: you are My witness. You are My publicity!</b><br />
So, today you have to take some vows. And you have to say: that, 'We are going to do these things. We are going to talk about Sahaj Yog, we are going to propagate it, we are going to spread it. And what may come, we are going to surrender ourselves to Mother. Even, if She's supposing, scolds us, or says anything it is for our good. And we are not going to get confused.' And that's how you have to absolutely vow that you are going to dedicate yourself to Sahaj Yog to help others, to e... emancipate, and to create atmosphere for the completion of this universe, of this creation, for that fruitful day when we will say: that the Kingdom of God has been brought on this Earth.<br />
So today is not the day for Me to give, but for you. You have to announce."</font><br />

That is why in this birth this position of the Guru has been created. <b>If the Mother becomes the Guru, it is a very difficult, as a mother is very tender.</b> A male guru will beat up, hit or even scold but for a mother when she utters even one harsh word her heart bleeds and pains a lot.

It was said about Guru Rāmadās Swāmī that make only such a person your guru who himself is Paras [touchstone], and who just by touching others does not make them into gold but makes them elixir [touchstone]. He makes others like himself.<br />
That is how the form of the mother is. A mother lives for her children. Lives in the glory of her children.<br />
That is why perhaps in this lifetime the Divine wanted this that this love and this knowledge should come through a Mother."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"[Mother's is] a very special institution ... ... especially in this country [Italy], they have such respect for their mothers.<br />
<b>Mother is the Source of Love.</b><br /> 
In the Qur'ān they asked Muhammad Sāhab, Whom should we bow after Allah?" So He said, "To Mother" -- "To the Mother." Then again they asked Him, He said: "Only the Mother." Again they asked Him, He said: "Only the Mother."<br />
I'm sure He must have said about the Divine Mother, because worldly mothers may not be complete mothers, perhaps. They are a[n] embodied, or, we can say, examples of Mother's Love, of the Divine Mother's Love, but they are human.<br />
So they can be conditioned, influenced or could be egoistical, especially if they are living in a particular country for a long time and have no idea of Divine Love.<br />
In Divine Love there is no expectations, it just flows, it doesn't think how to judge a person or what to do for a person, it just flows."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Today is ... I like the day when it is the Mother's, I should say, Mother's Day also. Because I think only a Mother can work it out that way. One has to have a lot of patience with people.<br />
......<br />
But mother's position is different. She'll go on struggling and fighting for her child. She'll fight it out to the last to see that the child gets all the benefits and this patience and this love and this forgiveness is innately built in in a mother, because her attitude is very different. Not any achievement, not any big name or what you call a sort of an award or anything. It is just she does it because she is a mother. And that is what is the sign of any mother, if she is a real mother, at least for her own children, she will go all out, she will work out everything for day in day out and to save the child from disaster. But Sahaja Yoga is a much bigger family and for that you really had to be worked out through the Mother's Principle. You cannot take any other principle.<br />
......<br />
So, in your own way, when you are doing Sahaja Yoga, there also you have to be a mother. <b>More mother's quality than the father's quality, that there's no ambition, there's no competition, there's no jealousies, nothing.</b> Just you want your children to come up and to grow into their spirituality. If that is the only attitude we have then you'll be amazed how satisfied you'll feel, because this is a very, very joy-giving thing, to see people growing in spirituality. Not only talking about it, not only reading about it, but actually happening, actualizing within yourself. So this quality is very helpful and that really helps every Sahaja Yogi to be patient, to be kind, to be humble."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Now, [the] Principle of Mother is in every, every Scripture, has to be there. Now the Mother's character is that She is the One Who is the Womb, She is the One Who is the Mother Earth and She is the One Who nourishes you. She's ... She nourishes us, you know that. And this feminine thing in a one ma... in every human being resides as this Kuṇḍalinī, as you have seen. And when She rises, She gives you this new awareness which becomes compassion, which is flowing, which becomes soothing, nourishing Energy of Love. And that's what today people are saying feminist go this thing and all that. That's again a pendulum -- a man becoming a woman, woman becoming man -- all these problem you have had because of this. But when you move spirally upward, then where do you move? You move, become a personality full of compassion, of love, of universal understanding, through Collective Consciousness. And then you rise up to a position where you become universally conscious. So that is what should happen to you. And, if that happens, then we should say that your motherly qualities within you have risen. And that's what we have so far neglected. You do not become a woman but you become motherly.

I should say She breaks the sixth center, because Gaṇeśha's center doesn't play any role. <b>So when She breaks the sixth center, which is the Sahasrāra, then She connects you to the All-pervading Power of Divine Love.</b><br />
<b>But what is this Divine Love? What does this do? It is the Energy of the Mother.

In the same way, the Sahaja Yogis are not to be involved in the other cells, human beings, of the body of this Universe.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"To keep the Sahasrāra open is, in a way, very easy, as well as difficult. As you have known in Devī Māhātmyam that ``at Sahasrārare Mahāmāyā comes." She's a Mahāmāyā: not easy to recognize Her, not easy to know Her. She lives just like you. She moves just like you. And you can never make out Her real nature. She is in the form of Mahāmāyā.<br />
......<br />
<b>So, in Sahasrāra Pūjā, actually, you have to recognize your own divinity, that you are divine, by experiencing your divinity. How do you experience your divinity? That you give Realization to others.</b><br /> 
It's a great experience to give Realization to others. Not only that you give Realization but you can tell about their chakras, you know what's wrong with them. You are quite confident."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Sahaja Yoga teaches how to love and adore the human body as the Temple of God Almighty.</b><br />
Sahaja Yoga is the working of the Unconscious and there are some very stupid people who think they can cheat God. In return they are cheated by Sahaja Yoga, and to their surprise, find themselves outwitted. The play of Sahaja Yoga can be very mischievous, and creates many miraculous happenings as well as a great deal of uproarious humor."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Sahaja Yoga was known to Me all along.</b> It is a unique knowledge with which I was born. It was not so easy to reveal it and I wanted to find out how to reveal it.<br />
First of all I thought that the seventh chakra must be opened, which I did, on 05th May 1970. It is a secret in a way. Formerly, the Brahmachaitanya was avyakta. It was not manifested. It was not expressed by itself, and so the people who managed to reach Brahmachaitanya somehow, by attaining `realization', said -- ``it was nirākār kā guṇa" ``you are like a drop that gets dissolved in the ocean."<br />
No one could say, explain or tell people anything more about it. The Great Incarnations also who came out of this Great Ocean of Brahmachaitanya, tried their best to share it with the best available followers -- which were very few -- and introduce them to this Brahmachaitanya. But because the Brahmachaitanya was not in avyakta form, these Incarnations got dissolved in it.<br />
......<br />
<b>Now I have come as the Incarnation of the Brahmachaitanya as a whole.</b> The sea of the Nirākār has now become a big cloud [Sākār]. It has taken a form. Those who came before were all a part and parcel of it. Now the whole has come. This cloud has rain water. The rain water is nourishing the minds of the people. Gradually they are brought to a level were their Kuṇḍalinīs have risen. They have got their Realization and now gradually they are feeling everything on their senses, their fingertips. This is the reason why nobody has talked about vibrations so clearly. They managed to talk about Chaitanya Laharī. This was so because of its avyakta [unmanifest] form. It was only a state. A state to be enjoyed, only in that state with no manifestation in the gross."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Today we have come here to do Hanumāna's Pūjā. 

Śhrī Hanumāna is a great character in our being and He runs all the way from Swādhiṣhṭhāna to your brain and He supplies all the necessary guidance we need in our futuristic planning or in our mental activities. He gives us guidance and protection.<br />
......<br />
It is very surprising how a Deity like Śhrī Hanumāna, who is an eternal child, because He was like a monkey. His head was that of a monkey, if not of an elephant.<br />
So He was an eternal child and He was the one who was used to run the right side of human beings. He was told that, ``You must control the Sun," to begin with He has to control the Sun, that the Sun in the people, if there is too much Sun then He must try to control it and make it cooler or smoother."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"It is such a joy today, and the whole atmosphere seems to be bubbling with it, as if the angels are singing. And the speciality of Hanumāna was that He was an angel. Angels are born like angels. They are angels, and they are not human beings. They're born with the angelic qualities. But now, you all have become angels from the human beings. It's a very great achievement of Sahaja Yoga. The qualities that are born with the angels are seen from their very childhood."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are celebrating Hanumāna's Jayanti</b> [birthday].<br />
What to say about Hanumāna? The more powerful and wise, He was equally devoted and dedicated.<br />
Generally such a powerful person becomes right-sided and considers himself so high that he would not listen to anyone else.<br />
But <b>Hanumāna is a special Deity, a typical Deity full of qualities. There was a perfect balance between his devotion and power</b>. How could he achieve this balance is a thing to be understood. In Sahaja Yoga, when we are enlightened, we get many powers. Then we have to keep balance. We love others and with the power of the love, we keep on doing our duties.<br />
Śhrī Hanumāna was very powerful. He had many Divine Powers in Him Navadhā, that is Garima, Laghima, etc. He could be as big as he wanted to be and as small as an atom. He had achieved all these powers."</font><br />

He is an innocent personality of a very high order, always keen to perform the task set out for Him by Śhrī Rāma. Later on also He appeared during the Incarnation of Śhrī Viṣhṇu as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa and used to ride on the top of the chariot of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br />

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"We say that Sahaja Yoga is the work of Divine Love. It's right, whether we know it or not, Its power is innate. It is Divine Power. <b>When a human being bows before someone and regards him higher, it is the expression of that Divine Power.</b> But when a person is respectful to his guru then he gets blessed with the grace and power of the guru.<br /> 
So <b>the devotion and the power (bhakti aur śhakti) are not different things. It is one. We shall say that the right side is the source of power and the left of bhakti. Śhrī Hanumāna had in Him this harmony of bhakti and śhakti</b>."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Śhrī Gaṇeśha and Śhrī Hanumāna are the Incarnations of this Divine Wisdom.</b> Śhrī Hanumāna was very powerful and fast and Śhrī Gaṇeśha is cool-natured. But when required, both are very big hitters. They remain with you every moment. Whenever anyone troubles you, your protectors are there. Often you see that security moves with the ministers and VIPs. The security of Sahaja Yogis also moves with them; that is, the security of gaṇas. Gaṇas have many things to do. Gaṇapati -- <b>Śhrī Gaṇeśha keeps them informed about you as to where is the problem, from where you are getting attacked and troubled. You do not know that if anybody wants to attack you secretly, even then these God's gaṇas stand by you. When Śhrī Gaṇapati informs about it, Śhrī Hanumāna sets them right</b>.

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So that is very important, especially <b>in the West where it's being really dangerously destroyed, the idea of auspiciousness and of holiness. So that is the power of any angel and that has to be fully established within us, and then on that power will work out, which gives you discretion, which gives you egolessness.</b><br />
I hope today both these things will work out within us in such a manner that we really become absolutely self-confident realized Souls whom I call as angels of modern times."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are going to celebrate the birthday of Mahāvīra.<br />
Mahāvīra is the Incarnation of Bhairavanāth, or you call Him as Saint Michael.</b> Now these two Saints as you know one as the Gabriel, Hanumāna, and another is Saint Michael. One is placed on the Piṅgalā nāḍī and another one, Saint Michael, on the Iḍā nāḍī.<br />
So, Mahāvīra had to go through lots of search. Of course He was a[n] angel, but came as human being and He had to find out the thing of the left side, and how the left side acts. It's a very complicated thing, left side, is much more complicated than right side. On the left side we have also seven nāḍīs, and these seven nāḍīs are placed one after another. They are described in books and given different names to them. Now these seven nāḍīs that are on the left side, as you know, they cater to our past. Say for example, every moment becomes a past. Every present becomes a past. Then we have past of this lifetime, and also we have past of our previous lives. Then all the past is built in within us since our creation."</font><br />

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="blue">"Now, Mahāvīra also was one of Them, who ... who was born again and again, and He was Mārkaṇḍeya, and He was Kabīra.<br />
The way Kabīra lashes people, you can see that He is tremendous! <b>He is like Bhairava!</b>"</font><br />

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"The ascetic life of Mahāvīra was of a very, very extreme nature. He was the one who was born in a ... uh ... clan of warriors, Kṣhatriyas. And then He was also married, also He had a daughter. And then He decided, because He knew He had to do the work of the Divine, He decided to take a saṃnyāsa. So He took uh the permission of His brother because His parents were dead. He was a king, so He gave up all His uh material wealth, everything and He beg ... became a complete saṃnyāsī. And the He left His family, His left His ... house, everything behind and went alone with a little bowl for begging alms. And there people who joined Him were very few, and He asked them that, "You have to also become ascetics," Munis.<br />
He was a Reincarnation of Saint Michael and He resides on the left side, on the Iḍā nāḍī. And He looks after the whole of it, right from Mūlādhāra onwards up to the Sahasrāra. So Saint Michael was born as Mahāvīra, meaning The Greatest Warrior. But when He was born, the whole place got lot of uh prosperity, that's why <b>He was called as Vardhamān, to begin with.</b>"</font><br />

</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>After they get their Realization, that He called as Kevalagyān: only the knowledge, only knowledge, means Pure Knowledge.</b> They will develop some Samyak Darśhan, means Integrated Personality and all the Collective Consciousness. He talked of all, all these things.<br /> 
But as He belonged to the left side, He has described Hell very clearly. Fundamentally, basically there are Fourteen Hells according to Him. And is horrible to read all that, what He has described about Hell. Because He wanted to tell people that, 'If you do all these wrong things, you'll go to Hell.'<br /> 
And He talked about, not about Form, Formly God, but Formless God, because He didn't want people to again start ritualism but get to right ... right to the position where they could get their Self-realization to cleanse themself.<br />
So you can imagine: how difficult, in those days at Mahāvīra, was even to be one of the candidates for Self-realization. It's frightening for you! <b>That's why I never had this uh Pūjā. Because to do all these things, first of all, and to become absolutely pure, then only He would give Realization.</b>"</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"That's why, <b>I think, this Mahāvīra Jayanti is a very great thing for us to observe.</b><br />
Now, why was He called Mahāvīra? Because only a person like Him -- Vir means a person who is brave, who is chivalrous -- because only He could do this, so only He could enter into the being fully and could kill or, you can say, destroy those horrible rākṣhasas, devils, all these negative things that come to us.<br />
Now, as you know, we use left side very much for so many negativity that is torturing us, but if there is no help, say, from Mahāvīra, we cannot do it. You call the name of Mahāvīra -- you could call Him Saint Michael, you can call Him by any name, but Mahāvīra because He was a human being. All this works out because of Him and He's such a great identity."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Even though Saraswatī has created all the Swaras, so what! <b>But the emotions it contains, the bhakti it contains it is due to the blessings of Mahāvīr.</b> Mahāvīr has really worked hard for this because he scared people that if you go to the wrong way, you go to hell, and on taking this correct way you will be overwhelmed and you all are actually witnessing it. Like this <b>we all should increase our bhakti and growing bhakti in the work of Mahāvīr. I am happy that on this day of Mahāvīr Jayanti you all are doing Mahāvīr's work</b> ......<br />
In Sahaja Yoga we recognize Lord Mahāvīra as the Incarnation of Śhrī Bhairavnāth. He also incarnated as Imam Husayn. Saint Michael is the same who is also called Saint George [the Guardian angel of London]."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>We have gathered here on the occasion of Rām Navamī.</b> Everybody has said, "Mother please tell us about Śhrī Rām."<br />
You know that Śhrī Rāma has a very important place on our chakra, He is situated on our right Heart. Śhrī Rāma has taken the place of father, hence if there is lack in the responsibility or love from father this chakra is caught.<br />
In Sahaja Yoga we too understand that Śhrī Rāma and all other Deities have taken the form to fulfill Their divine work, in all Śhrī Rāma had a special task. As it was said by Socrates that the Benevolent King has to come the same way Śhrī Rāma had come on this Earth as benevolent king, He came in the form of human being, He even forgot that He was Incarnation of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, forgot about Him but for all world He was Puruṣhottama Rāma.<br />
In Sahaja Yoga we need to know when we pray any Deity, we have imbibed the specialties and qualities of the particular Deity within us, Śhrī Rāma had many qualities.<br />
You all know his childhood life and you have already heard about his qualities, he was Puruṣhottama he had another quality that in his ruling, he did not care for his wife or children's in front of his subjects view."</font><br />

<font color="DarkGreen">"Śhrī Rāma Himself was born on the right side. Great example for all of you is Śhrī Rām who was on the right side, who works the right side. When He was born and He was a child ... <b>He is a Sūryavaṃśhi, He is the son of Sūrya, I mean, Sūrya's everything comes from the Sun to Him.</b> When He was born and was a little child, He asked His mother that, ``I would like have uh like to have the Moon." The [He] started crying, and nobody knew how to satisfy. He said, ``I want to have the Moon." They gave Him any toys, He threw away. Said, ``What a child it is‽ Funny thing! He wants to have the Moon, now how to get Him the moon?" They did not know how to solve the problem. He said, ``Somehow you get Me the Moon. I don't want to eat or anything, I want to have the Moon." Here the Moon represents the Ātmā, the cooling [smiling:] capacity. He asked for the Moon.<br />
You are all on the right side, so ask for the Moon. Ask for the Spirit.<br />
And they didn't know how to satisfy this Śhrī Rāma, who was the [laughing:] Incarnation of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, [laughing:] asking for the Moon of all the things, not for anything else. What's so important? So, the mother has always a[n] intuition. She brought a -- it's a, it's a māyā, it's a beautiful drama -- she brought a mirror and showed Him the Moon in the mirror. He [she] said, ``Now, you can get the Moon here." [Laughter, laughs.] So sweet! And He was satisfied! Even the reflection of that can satisfy.<br />
You are like the mirrors and I want to see the reflection of Moon [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] in you. "</font><br />

Through the medium of Śhrī Rāma can bring change in our thoughts, he can bring change in our behavior because he is ideal for us, reaching this ideal we can reach other ideals since he is ideal of human being.<br />

The idea of a king related to God came from Śhrī Rāma.</b><br /> 
But the modern kings are not like that, they have no relation with God. On the contrary, they are horrid people. Some of them are nothing but satanic people, absolutely Satan is there and you can see from the way they lead their lives, and they have led their life before. So the benevolence of Śhrī Rāma is here [shows the right Heart] to be followed by all the political leaders and all the people who are at the helm of affairs. He is the ideal that was created for human beings, to run their authority as the head, or the loving compassionate benevolent leader of the people, who has to govern them by making them respectful, by respect. And if human beings create such things who are not respectable, those who have no human values, those who have no moral courage, those who are selfish, those who are self-centered, then they have nothing to do to be there.<br />

All these Powers are there for us to ascent. If these Powers are properly used and understood, then your ascent can be permanent. Once you achieve your ascent and enter into the Kingdom of God, all these Powers get enlightened.<br />
And these Powers which are enlightened are absolutely filled with Love. Enlightenment, we have to understand that we get completely enlightened by Love. So after enlightenment, after Realization we use only one Power which is of Love."</font><br />

  Till today many Saints have written and spoken a lot about the Śhakti. Those who could not explain the Śhakti in their texts they did it in their poems. Additionally they learnt different meanings of the Śhakti.<br />
  But one thing probably we may not know is that inside every human beings these powers are present in a dormant state and all these powers human being can awaken within himself. All these powers which are present in the dormant state are endless, nor anybody can guess their limit because as an example there are 35 crores [350 million] Deities seated within you. Apart from that there are several powers that are running them, but at least we can understand that the Self-realization that we received today, certainly <b>some Śhaktis must have worked this out.

You all know the story of Satī Devī, I don't have to tell you in new way but She was Gangaur. She was married and while She was returning after marriage with Her husband some of the bad elements surrounded them and killed Her husband. She came out of the bride's carriage, took the Rudra Form and destroyed all of them who attacked Her husband and then She finished Herself also.

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>In India, Navarātri falls twice in a year. Once it is in the month of Chaitra as it is today.<br />
On this day Devī is worshiped as Śhailaputrī, means the daughter of Himalaya.</b> Devī has many other names also but first of all She incarnated as Śhailaputrī in the cold of Himalayas. She incarnated and whatever She was to do, She started there.<br />
Further story is known to you. [King] Dakṣha did not invite Lord Śhiva in the Havana that he performed and Śhailaputrī was the consort of Lord Śhiva. She is called Satī because She entered the Holy fire of Havana and ablated Herself. But by then Lord Śhiva reached there. He lifted Her burnt up body from the fire. Burnt pieces of the body of Śhailaputrī fell at many places. All these places are considered to be Śhakti Pīṭhas, the places of worship, as there is in Vindhyāchala and many other places. Her power moves there and it is said that it Sanctifies everything.<br />
Her seventh power is considered to be the Power of Destruction. Śhakti manifested Itself on the right side as Sāvitrī and Gāyatrī but the destroying force was manifested in the center.<br />
In the form of Durgā and Her other forms manifested in Heart chakra. She is present there.<br />
If some one hurts you, confuses or disturbs you then this power will protect you and destroy your enemy.<br />
When Kuṇḍalinī rises and reaches the Heart chakra then it manifests and becomes more powerful and effective because Kuṇḍalinī is Jagadambā. In Sahaja Yoga when Kuṇḍalinī is awakened it settles in Heart chakra. It protects you and takes care of you nicely."</font><br />

Śhālivāhana Kings were worshipers of the Goddess and it is said that they used to present Shawl to the Goddess and they were also called as Sāt[a]vāhanas in the beginning because they recognized the seven chakras [Sāt[a]vāhana means seven chakras]. That's why they were earlier called as Sāt[a]vāhana but later it changed to Śhālivāhana. But the symbol of Śhālivāhana used to be guḍhī means a flag and above that a pitcher having a particular shape, which represented the Kuṇḍalinī. They were worshipers of Kuṇḍalinī and recognized it.<br />
That is the reason that they have made this thing like that and all those, who accept it, put up a 'guḍhī' in their houses. They [Śhālivāhans] wanted to welcome Kuṇḍalinī on this day and Kuṇḍalinī [in the form of pitcher] was exhibited specially on that day."</font><br />

With respect to the Guḍhī Pāḍavā the shawl has great significance. The Śhālivāhan Kings always carried the Goddess's shawl with them. You know the significance of Devī's shawl. You know it gives Her beauty. With the shawl She protects Herself from cold and wind. Also with it She protects Her chastity, as well as if any dirt is about to touch Her body it is prevented. So, a shawl which is offered to Goddess symbolizes Her protection, meaning, 'As You protect us we offer You this.' Further if the children are sleeping or are sick or have a problem, then She covers them with the shawl. So shawl is very important. You know, in the past it was a practice with all people in Maharashtra to take [put a] shawl over their bodies. Now that we have become modern we do not take it."</font><br />

<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Today is new year day and the beginning of the Moon. That is why this day is given so much significance. It is known as Guḍhī Pāḍavā.</b><br />
A flag is put on a stick and on it is put a small pitcher. This pitcher represents Kuṇḍalinī. It is taken as a symbol. The Śhālivāhanas were the devotees of the Devī [Goddess] and it is told that they used to offer shawl to the Goddess. In the beginning they were called Sāt[a]vāhans because they worshiped Seven Plexuses and this Sāt[a]vāhana was ultimately changed into Śhālivāhana. 
<b>But the symbol of Śhālivāhana is the same. They put up a 'guḍhī' means a flag and a small pitcher is put on it as a symbol. This pitcher has a particular shape which represents Kuṇḍalinī.</b><br />
So they were the worshipers of Kuṇḍalinī and followed it. That is the reason they made this symbol in this way. All those who follow Kuṇḍalinī put up a guḍhī in their houses and also put a flag on it and thus it is indicated that they welcome Kuṇḍalinī and exhibit it in a special way."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"As you know, <b>on the Day of Holī, Holikā was burnt</b>. Agni [God of Fire] had a very big blessing and task, because Agni Devatā had given Holikā a boon that in any circumstance, she will not burn, that death could come to her in any form, but not by fire. And after giving this boon, he regretted a lot because she took Prahlād in her lap and sat in the fire. And Agni Devatā had a big dilemma, that, "I have given this promise to her, that I will not burn her and how can I fulfill this promise? And Prahlād, is Himself innocence personified, He is Himself an Incarnation of Śhrī Gaṇeśha and how can I burn Him? Nobody can burn Him. And He is also beyond my powers. He is formed from my power." So he thought, "What is this ego? that in front of such a Great Power what can I talk about my power? I have no such power which can face Him. His Power is so great that I cannot burn Him whatsoever I may try. But at this time I have a very big dilemma in front of me."<br />
So in between duty and dharma the dilemma is in between these two. In this situation we must understand that dharma is higher than duty. <b>The duty of dharma is higher than a normal duty and even higher is the Dharma of the Ātmā.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, the great day of Holikā Dahana</b>, where the symbolism of this occasion is that the satanic forces were burnt by the innocence of Prahlāda. And that is what we have to remember, that when the Sahaja Yogis take to innocence and complete dependence on to their vibratory awareness, which is the indication of God's Manifestation through them, they are completely protected, and even a satanic person like Holikā could not burn him [them].<br />
And this is the day today, we have to recognize that, as Sahaja Yogis, we stand no dangers in life. We are fearless people, but we are humble people, loving people, and anxious to save as many as possible. To eman... to raise the whole humanity into another awareness, in the process of your evolution you have to achieve ghaṭ, for which you have to work hard."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Holī was started during the time of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.</b> Before Him in the time of Śhrī Rāma ... He was very austere. Because of that the society became very peaceful but people were devoid of all joy. So He thought that there should be a way by which people should be able to laugh freely and be joyful. And like it happens to all such ventures it happened in the case of Holī also that it produced an opposite effect.<br />
......<br />
<b>The story of how it started is like this.</b> There was a demoness called Holikā. She was the sister of Prahlād and Prahlād's father used to trouble him a lot. Holikā had a boon that she would not be burnt by the fire. Prahlād's father wanted to kill him and told Holikā to take the child [Prahlād] and sit on the burning pyre thinking that she would not die. But it is surprising that she died and Prahlād was not hurt in the fire and came out of it unscathed.<br />
This is a very big happening which demonstrated that it is very wrong to be cruel and aggressive. She had the boon but still she got burnt. That's why we have this custom on Holī.<br />
In our country [India] all such things have a lot of truthfulness. We have to understand that if we do wrong things, trouble others ... then these are demonic qualities.<br />
......<br />
We should not have these demonic qualities because we are Sahaja Yogis. We are a special race of people who have taken birth to transform this world and we should pay our attention towards that. We are very highly placed, higher than all others and we have to save all others from such tendencies. These days it has spread a lot. That's why all such hateful, cruel behavior by which we dominate others, torture others is very, very bad and there is no need to do all that in Sahaja Yoga."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So, <b>with Holī after dahan</b> [scorching], like I said yesterday, <b>let us decide today, that now Holī will be like Diwālī</b>. The joy of it should be overwhelming. Why the joy of Holī? Although we burn just one Holikā but afterwards, the joy flows in the Collective Consciousness, whether he is a sweeper or a garbage collector or even any other person working in the house. Like in My family, in Lucknow, from where My family belongs, these people are landlords. So the sweeper does not dare to enter inside the house. People don't like them coming even their threshold, to that extent. They reprimanded them.<br />
But <b>on the Day of Holī, any person, whether he is a master or a servant, anybody, they all play Holī together</b>. Even if you tear the clothes of the master then also no one will reprimand you on the Day of Holī. This is the way a social and collective celebration of happiness started in our country."</font><br />
