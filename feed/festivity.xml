<font color="DarkRed">"Today we have gathered here to worship Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's Incarnation.<br />
As you know that Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa is the Incarnation of Nārāyaṇa, of Śhrī Viṣhṇu.<br />
So in every Incarnation, They carry all Their qualities, all Their powers, and all Their nature with Them.<br />
So when He incarnated, He had all the qualities of Nārāyaṇa, and then that of Rāma, but every Incarnation tries to rectify whatever in Their previous life has been misunderstood and have been carried to the extremes. That's why They have to come back again and again.<br />
......<br />
So, as Śhrī Viṣhṇu, when He thought of taking His Incarnation, because He is the One who is the Sp... Preserver, He's the Preserver, of this Creation, and also the Preserver of Dharma. So when He took His Incarnation He had to see that people keep to their dharma.<br />
By keeping the dharma all right only, you could get your Realization."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Today in India, we celebrate a set ... special festival. <b>It is called as Rakṣhā-bandhan. Rakṣhā means protection and bandhan means the bondage: the bondage of protection. Is a very nice, good, social custom to have this beautiful festival today.<br />
Today is the Full Moon Day, and this day what we do is to tie a band of threads around the person whom you want to protect. But it is done between brothers and sisters.</b> The sisters tie this bondage to the wrist of the brothers, and when they do that, they are putting all their love around the wrist, that it is the day for giving all their love, everything to their brother, as a protection, as a symbol of their protection through that thread. Is a very, very simple thread they use. And uh this is, has to be tied on the left-hand side. But people tie it on the right-hand side, which is a mistake. But it has to be tied on the left-hand side."</font><br />

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="blue">"Now this rākhī is nothing but the Viṣhṇumāyā's Power, which protects the brother. Actually, there the brother [Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa] protected Her, and now the sister's love protects the brother.<br />
So the relationship between brother and sister is much more important than any other relationship. Because it's so pure, is so protective, is so loving, and also it is of an equal age."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So the relationship between Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa and Viṣhṇumāyā is that of a brother and a sister.<br />
And surprisingly, the other day we celebrated the Rākhī Bandhan, the Rakṣhābandhan, which is the same thing as the brothers-sisters relationship.<br />
So now here we are celebrating actually the Deity which is the Sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br />
Later on She was born as Draupadī. And that's why Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa went to save Her chastity, because is the brother only who is concerned about the chastity and the name of the sister."</font><br />

<b>Auṃ Twameva sākṣhāt Śhrī Pāvitrya Dāyinī sākshāt<br />
Śhrī Ādi Śhakti Mātājī Śhrī Nirmalā Devī namo namaḥ!</b><br />
O Divine Mother, You are verily the One who gives chastity, the Foundation of all dharmas.<br />
Salutations to You!<br />
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now Viṣhṇumāyā's Power is very important to understand, because Mother Power is to protect your innocence, because that is the most important thing. To protect your innocence is the Mother's Power.</b> Now, Viṣhṇumāyā's Power is to protect your chastity. You don't understand sometimes what is chastity and what is innocence. Innocence is a power which is not acted upon. Like we have electricity in our house, the electricity exists like innocence exists within us; but enactment of that is done through chastity. A person can say, 'I did this very innocently' -- no, he cannot. Because whatever you do if it is innocent, cannot be harmful to your character, to your innocence or to your righteousness.<br />
So those people who say like this, that, 'I did it innocently,' are wrong, because innocently if you do anything it becomes chastity. So when innocence is practiced it becomes chastity. You must have respect of your chastity. <b>Chastity is the one which is Viṣhṇumāyā's Power within us, Gaurī's Power, is the pure virgin.</b><br />
......<br />
Now to understand the significance of chastity within us, we have to know that <b>chastity is the foundation of all dharmas</b>. Unless and until you have sense of chastity you cannot have dharma. Dharma is not possible because that's the foundation. It will be a house of cards; if you do not have the foundation of chastity it will just collapse in no time."</font><br />

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now our Viṣhṇumāyā Principle is to be always kept very alert because it helps us in many ways.</b> First of all it helps us to pass the messages from your heart to your head. It is the one by which we integrate. Our heart and head is integrated by the Viṣhṇumāyā Principle more than the Viśhuddhi on the right side.<br />
Viśhuddhi on the right side can create collectivity, can create understanding with each other but on the left side it helps you to keep a complete integration between your heart and your head.<br />
If there is a guilt you just think of it and analyze it. It means that there's a struggle between you in your heart and your mind, isn't it? Simple as that. If it was integrated you would not feel guilty. And that is why all these artificial theories that have come, all these artificial yarns that you have read and all that, you forget it.<br />
<b>You are a Sahaja Yogi and you have entered into the Kingdom of God -- enjoy! That's all you have to do. But you have to get to that state of enjoyment and understanding that you are above all.</b>"</font><br />

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="blue">"This Viṣhṇumāyā is the one who has helped you because <b>She is the Sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa</b>, and because this is the domain of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, She came down here to help you.<br />
Now She's the Sister -- this must be understood very well. Now sisterly relation is a pure relationship."</font><br />

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So now here Viṣhṇumāyā is the One who is the virgin. Not only that She is a virgin, but She exist[s] in all the five elements, as shown that She [Śhrī Draupadī] married five Pāṇḍavas. And that, this power of virginity in Her, used to expose people to the dangers of these horrible Kauravas who were going to rule and destroy the dharma. See, so She stood back. And She is the one who said that, "You have to fight. You have to fight for dharma, whatever may happen."<br />
And Kṛiṣhṇa always supported Her. So, as a brother, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa supported Her.<br />
So the relationship between brother and sister are very important, in India. Also should be with Sahaja Yogis, because we have Rākhī Bandhan. You also have what you call the Bhāī Dūj, where on Diwālī Day we tie up a rākhī to the brother.<br />
<b>Now this rākhī is nothing but the Viṣhṇumāyā's Power, which protects the brother. Actually, there the brother [Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa] protected Her, and now the sister's love protects the brother.<br />
So the relationship between brother and sister is much more important than any other relationship. Because it's so pure, is so protective, is so loving, and also it is of an equal age.</b>"</font><br />

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image1213.png" /></div>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So, this day is uh extremely important, in a way, for Sahaja Yogis to observe, and I'm happy that I am here, because it's very important also for America.</b><br />
Uh as I told you that, I have already talked to you how the-ee war between Alexander and Puru's was finished because of a sister's intervention.<br />
And, also, how Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, whose sister was Draupadī, Viṣhṇumāyā was born as Draupadī, and how He came to save Her chastity, by rushing all the way from Dvārika.<br /> 
So, we can see that when we ascend in the Collective Consciousness and we have collective living, collective meeting, at the Viśhuddhi chakra, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa establish[ed] this, or He manifested uh this pure relationship of a sister.<br />
In a collective life that we have, in the Āśhram where we live, where we move about as Sahaja Yogis, if we do not have this basic principle within us, there will be a chaos, complete chaos. Once this purity of relationship is established, that apart from my wife, all the rest are my sisters or mothers, it cannot be a proper society and <b>the chaos of the social system of America is because they have no sense of pure relationships.<br />
Once you call somebody a sister, she's a sister. And once you call somebody a brother, she's [he's] a brother. It's not only that you should be born of the same parents, it's not necessary, but this is a very important principle to have a very pure society where everybody can live peacefully.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">Many blessings,<br />
Received your rākhīs conveying your deep love. Rākhī is Protecting Power. Its bond is very strong and extremely tender because it symbolizes the noble love of sister. Customarily, <b>tying a rākhī to someone is establishing a place of Pure Protection</b>. However, man's ability to understand love has become so feeble that tying of rākhī has become merely a mechanical process. All beautiful human traditions become lifeless and dry formalities if there is no warmth of faith in them.<br />
......<br />
<b>Rākhī Pūrṇimā is a day of great significance. On that day you should ask for perfection, make big decisions and keep attention on high ideals.</b> Sahaja Yogis should not destroy their attention on trifle issues. Lot of work has yet to be done. Those Sahaja Yogis who have progressed should get busy. New centers should be opened. People should be cured of their diseases and their attention should be drawn towards God-realization.<br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is a day peoples ... this is created by human beings and not by God, as Guru Pūrṇimā. Because as God has created days of Their advent, human beings have created days of their surrendering.</b> So this is the day when you have to give something to the Guru, and Guru does not have to give anything to you. This is the time you have to say: `What you are going to give? What you are going to do for your Guru?' Because so far the Guru has been giving.<br />
If you are in meditation, supposing you say, `We'll meditate because Guru Pūrṇimā is there,' that's not the way the Guru Pūrṇimā is to be celebrated. Because if you meditate, you are taking from Me. If you try to correct yourself, you are taking from Me. If you are going to get cured, you are taking from Me.<br />
So now what can you do for Me? Is the point, you have to think about it. `What can you do?'<br />
Now I have sent the same question to India, to find ... I asked them to find out: `What can you do for Me?'<br />
You will say: `Mother, what can we do? After all, what are we?' That's a way of evading the issue.<br />
But if you really want to see, <b>you can do a lot. And that is what it is that: you are My witness. You are My publicity!</b><br />
So, today you have to take some vows. And you have to say: that, `We are going to do these things. We are going to talk about Sahaj Yog, we are going to propagate it, we are going to spread it. And what may come, we are going to surrender ourselves to Mother. Even, if She's supposing, scolds us, or says anything it is for our good. And we are not going to get confused.' And that's how you have to <b>absolutely vow that you are going to dedicate yourself to Sahaj Yog to help others, to e... emancipate, and to create atmosphere for the completion of this universe, of this creation, for that fruitful day when we will say: that the Kingdom of God has been brought on this Earth.<br />
So today is not the day for Me to give, but for you. You have to announce.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is the day of Guru Pūrṇimā. It is a Full Moon Day. That's why ... it is called as Pūrṇimā. The guru has to be like a Full Moon. Means completely grown, completely matured.</b><br />
There are sixteen kalās or the phases of the Moon, and when the complete Pūrṇimā comes in, the Full Moon Day, all the sixteen kalās are completed. You also know that in the Viśhuddhi chakra there are sixteen sub-plexuses. When Kṛiṣhṇa is described as Virāṭa, He's called as the Sampūrṇa, the Complete Incarnation of Viṣhṇu's aspect, because He's got the sixteen phases completely done.<br />
So today's number is sixteen. Six plus one: seven.<br />
Now we have to understand the importance of guru. <b>Why should we have a guru when we have God?</b> We've got Śhakti, then why should we have a guru? <b>What is the need to have a guru?</b><br />
Guru means the weight, the weight. We get our weight from the magnetic forces of the gravity of the Mother Earth. So, guru means gravity: the gravity in a person.<br />
<b>Why do we need a guru?</b><br />
Because to know God is easy, specially in Sahaja Yoga, to be one with Him. As soon as you get your Self-realization in Sahaja Yoga, the modern Sahaja Yoga, immediately you become entitled to give Realizations to other people.<br />
It was said that, ``Guru is the person who makes you meet the Divine." But's not true. Because any self-realized person, in the Sahaja Yoga, can raise the Kuṇḍalinī and king ... can give Self-realization to others, immediately after they have touched the Sahasrāra or opened the Sahasrāra. But normally a realized Soul cannot do it. Any born realized Soul cannot do it on its own: it has to have authority of Me, as I am today.<br />
That's why it was said that, ``Guru is a person who makes you meet God": he raises the Kuṇḍalinī and makes you one with God."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"In the Guru Principle, we have seen people who came on this Earth. They were all mostly born realized, actually, and they never gave Realization to anyone to -- very big difference. They were all born as realized Souls, and they became as Sufis and they are called by different names, but they were not given Self-realization, they had it.<br />
And because of their Self-realization, as they had, they have so much of knowledge. And that is what they tried to impart to people.<br />
They knew all about chakras everything they knew, somehow, must be in their last lives achievements that they knew it, perhaps some of them were disciples of other very great people."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Sahaja Yoga is very different from all other gurus that we believe in the Power of Love. Power of Love teaches you how to be forgiving, it makes you noble, it makes you very balanced.</b><br />
So, the gurus who were there for Bhavasāgara, to establish dharma in the human beings, first thing, they had to balance themselves against all practical things, as they call it. They think is not practical! But they said, ``No! For us, this is higher, nobler and important." <b>So they would balance people because they had this Power of Love within themselves. All these Ādi Gurus and Their Incarnations, if you see Them, They always had balance and always prayed ... praised the Love of God.</b>"</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we are going to do the Pūjā of Ādi Śhakti.</b><br />
It's a difficult subject uuh to talk about Ādi Śhakti, because is not easy to understand that Ādi Śhakti is the Power of Sadāśhiva. Sadāśhiva is the God Almighty. She is His breath, as they some people call it. <b>Some say She is the Desire and some say that She's the Entire Power of Sadāśhiva and Sadāśhiva cannot do anything without Her Powers.</b><br />
......<br />
The first thing is, we must know, that She created a Kuṇḍalinī in the Mother Earth Itself and She created Śhrī Gaṇeśha out of the Mother Earth, it's very interesting.<br />
So, the Mother Earth becomes a very important thing for us. If we do not know how to respect the Mother Earth, we do not know how to respect ourselves.<br />
The expression of Ādi Śhakti within you is the Kuṇḍalinī, no doubt. That is the reflection of Ādi Śhakti in you. But the reflection in the Mother Earth is also expressed, as you all know, in different places, different countries, different cities as the manifestation of chakras and Ādi Śhakti's creations. It was very important first to create a very holy Mother Earth for human beings to be born on them [it]. So the reflection of the Ādi Śhakti as Kuṇḍalinī first was on the Mother Earth.<br />
Kuṇḍalinī is a, we should say, is a wee part of the Ādi Śhakti. <b>Or we can say that She is the desire, pure desire of the Ādi Śhakti. So Ādi Śhakti is the desire, complete desire of Sadāśhiva, and Kuṇḍalinī, Ādi Kuṇḍalinī, is the desire, complete desire of Ādi Śhakti.</b>"</font><br />

Is very important that this Pūjā must be performed.</b> Because that is how you grow, this reflection improves, and you grow more and more within yourself, through the Power of Ādi Śhakti or through the power of Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
As you know that: Ādi Śhakti has Her own Kuṇḍalinī, which is the Ādi Kuṇḍalinī, and the reflection of that, within you, is the Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
So you have to worship. And is the best way to please your own Kuṇḍalinī, your own mother, who has given you this birth."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we have gathered here to do the Kuṇḍalinī Pūjā, or the Ādi Śhakti Pūjā.</b><br />
There's a difference between the two: <b>Ādi Śhakti is the Total Power of God, of His Desire, while [Ādi] Kuṇḍalinī is the One that is reflected, part which is reflected in the human beings as Kuṇḍalinī.</b> So there's a difference between the Ādi Kuṇḍalinī and the Ādi Śhakti.<br />
<b>Ādi Śhakti is the Parāśhakti, is the Power which is beyond all the powers, which controls all the powers. And one of the powers of Ādi Śhakti is Kuṇḍalinī.</b><br />
For example, the Kuṇḍalinī which is placed within Me, in the triangular bone, is not [the] totality of Me. In the same way, the Kuṇḍalinī, which is placed within you, is not the totality. Of course, It is the power which is there to give you your Self-realization. Is the power that redeems you, that nourishes you, that enlightens your centers.<br />
But there are two other powers, as you know, very powerful, which are working through Iḍā and Piṅgalā. And the third one is Mahālakṣhmī which is in the center. "</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So, in that reflection that you are Me, in that rekflection [reflection] that the Mother Earth is Me</b>, in that beautiful creation within you, you have to become very sensitive to the need of the world, what is the need of the world. <b>Today, if you fail, the whole thing will fail forever.</b> Only very few will be there. So the need for you is: to spread Sahaja Yoga because this love is not only for you. Is not to be enjoyed [only] by you, but is to be enjoyed by as many possible in the whole world.<br />
<b>So, today we have to decide that, as the children of Ādi Śhakti, we have to go all out, everywhere, every corner, we have to shout and we have to tell loudly what is the time in which we are living and what is the responsibility that you have to fulfill as Sahaja Yogis.</b>"</font><br />

......<br />
So this Ādi Śhakti's Love is something so, so subtle, is so subtle. You cannot understand sometimes. I know you all love Me very much. It's tremendous love for Me, and when I get the vibrations from you, it is like the ripples that reach the shores and again they return back and lots of little, little sparkling drops are there, on the shore also. In the same way in My heart I feel your love echoing the beauty of this Divine Love ... which I cannot la explain to you the experience that it creates.

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we are all going to worship Me, first time. It has been always the Pūjā of [an] aspect of Me or a part of Me.</b><br />
Now, one has to know very clearly what is Ādi Śhakti. As we say, is the Pure Desire of God Almighty, of Sadāśhiva. But what is the pure Desire of God Almighty?<br />
If you see your own desires, come out of what? Not out of the Divine Love but out of carnal love, out of material love, of out of power love. Behind all these desires there is love.<br />
If you do not love something you will not desire it. So, these mundane types of love that you have, for which we spend so much of our time uselessly, actually they do not give you satisfaction, because that is not true love that you have. Just infatuation for the time being, and then you just get fed up with it, and from there you jump to another thing, to another thing, to another thing.<br />
So <b>Ādi Śhakti is the Embodiment of God's Divine Love, is God's Pure Love, and in His Love what did He desire? He desired that He should create human beings, who would be very obedient, would be sublime, would be like angels. And that was His idea: to create Adam and Eve.</b>"</font><br />

And They are sitting there, busybodies, you know [soft laughter]. They are sitting quietly waiting for a chance, you see, to emit vibrations, to save you, you see, They want to just rush. They emit so much [laughing:] that They lose, 'Just wait, just wait.' They want to save you, They want to give you, They're so anxious, in Their anxiety to save you. I like it, to see the way They are anxious. But [laughs] ... but you don't suck it and I have a problem there. Once They've given They don't want to take it back. You don't suck it, so it has to go to the atmosphere, it has to disappear somewhere. Is directed towards you and you don't take it, so where does it go? It hangs into My tissues, it pains Me.<br />
So, sucking should be more. Sucking should be more. <b>And just before the Pūjā you should say: 'Mother, make me such that I suck more of the Divine!' Just pray that, with sincerity from your heart, just say that.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"It's nice today it's Mother's Day, and You find so many people waiting for You.<br />
And also You see Yourself as a Mother, the heart which is pining to meet, then You can't get out of some things. And then You enjoy that pining, that longing to see Your own, Your own children whom You love so much. Is such a great joy.<br />
In these modern times, it is described that in this Kali Yuga everything will go upside down because people will not recognize the motherhood. The mothers won't be respected and won't be respectable either. Is a fact.<br />
And imagine now this has brought this Mother's Day to this country. It's something, such a recognition from the Divine that one has to remember that motherhood is very important.<br />
......<br />
<b>So the power that your Mother has, of giving birth, the spiritual birth, be bestowed upon all of you so that you do this work with the same grace and with the same patience and love and enjoyment.<br />
May God bless you.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"[Mother's is] a very special institution ...... especially in this country [Italy], they have such respect for their mothers.<br />
<b>Mother is the Source of Love.</b> In the Qur'ān they asked Muhammad Sāhab whom should we bow after Allah? So He said "to Mother" -- "to the Mother."<br />
Then again they asked Him, He said: "Only the Mother." Again they asked Him, He said: "Only the Mother."<br />
I'm sure He must have said about the Divine Mother, because worldly mothers may not be complete mothers, perhaps. They are a[n] embodied, or, we can say, examples of Mother's Love, of the Divine Mother's Love, but they are human.<br />
So they can be conditioned, influenced or could be egoistical, especially if they are living in a particular country for a long time and have no idea of Divine Love.<br />
<b>In Divine Love there is no expectations, it just flows, it doesn't think how to judge a person or what to do for a person, it just flows.</b>"</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Today is ... I like the day when it is the Mother’s, I should say, Mother’s Day also. Because I think only a Mother can work it out that way. One has to have a lot of patience with people.<br />
.......<br />
But mother’s position is different. She’ll go on struggling and fighting for her child. She’ll fight it out to the last to see that the child gets all the benefits and this patience and this love and this forgiveness is innately built-in in a mother, because her attitude is very different. Not any achievement, not any big name or what you call a sort of an award or anything. It is just she does it because she is a mother. And that is what is the sign of any mother, if she is a real mother, at least for her own children, she will go all out, she will work out everything for day in day out and to save the child from disaster. But Sahaja Yoga is a much bigger family and for that you really had to be worked out through the Mother’s Principle. You cannot take any other principle.<br />
......<br />
So, in your own way, when you are doing Sahaja Yoga, there also you have to be a mother. <b>More mother’s quality than the father’s quality, that there’s no ambition, there’s no competition, there’s no jealousies, nothing.</b> Just you want your children to come up and to grow into their spirituality. If that is the only attitude we have then you’ll be amazed how satisfied you’ll feel, because this is a very, very joy-giving thing, to see people growing in spirituality. Not only talking about it, not only reading about it, but actually happening, actualizing within yourself. So this quality is very helpful and that really helps every Sahaja Yogi to be patient, to be kind, to be humble."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"I have to tell ... I'll have to tell you the story about the Sahasrāra Day, about which it was decided, long time back, before I incarnated. They had a big meeting in the Heavens, all the thirty-five karoṛs [350 millions] of Gods, the Deities were there present to decide what is to be done. <b>'This is the ultimate that we have to do to human beings: is to open their Sahasrāra, to open their awareness to the Spirit, to the Real Knowledge of the Divine, to remove the darkness of ignorance.'</b> And it had to be spontaneous because it has to work the living force of God. Also, it had to be very quick. So all the Gods requested that now, I, the Ādi Śhakti has to take the birth.<br />
They all tried Their best. They did whatever was possible. The Saints were made by Them but very few. They incarnated and people made religions out of Them which were perverted, brought Them bad name. No reality in those religions. These religions were money-oriented or power-oriented. There was no Divine Force working, actually, it was all anti-Divine."</font><br />

The deity of Sahasrāra is a very simple person, extremely simple, and can be moved with very little actions,<br />
can be pleased with very few little actions here and there.<br />
Not much is needed to please the deity of Sahasrāra.<br />
It’s a very simple person. Little things make Her happy."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"It has been such a great pleasure and glorification of Sahaja Yoga today, I remember the day when it started, on the 5th May 1970. And today I see all of you so much engulfed in the Divine Love and Divine Power.<br />
<b>The whole thing shows one very great, fundamental thing, of Sahasrāra: that people from so many countries integrated together.</b><br />
Integrated. It was Sahaj, spontaneous, but every way and there was no confusion, there’s no quarreling, no fighting, nothing. Such an integration, spontaneous, whether it is on the stage or stage of life.<br />
Now, as we are all global personalities, we are all integrated and those who were acting were enjoying as well as the ones who were looking at them were also enjoying in the same manner.<br />
It was such a good also integration between the one who was acting, or the all those who were there, and all those who were watching – I couldn’t understand whether the people who are seeing them are also acting, or also those who are acting are also seeing.<br />
It was a beautiful blending I must say, and I congratulate all the leaders of all these five countries, who have contributed so well to this deep sense of integration.<br />
Not that is the integration within that is important – of course that’s very important for a personality, but for our work, for our global emancipation we need integration of all the nations, and understanding of all the nations, because these barriers are created by human beings, not by God Almighty.<br />
So we have transcended those barriers, and the way we are all sitting together in a complete integrated mood is – you don’t know what your Mother feels, I, I just can’t believe that in such a short time this we have achieved, in My lifetime I can see all these things happening.<br />
So it was such a beautiful sahaja, spontaneous, creation of the Spirit of this integration, and I congratulate all the leaders for this, and we all should thank them, for giving us this beautiful integrated, Sahaj spontaneous illustration of [the] Sahaj character.<br />
Thank you very much.<br />
May God bless you all."</font><br />

Let us see what is the quality of the cells of Sahasrāra. These are specially created cells through the working of the Swādhiṣhṭhāna.

<font color="DarkRed">"So after so many days, the Sahasrāra has been opened out. We have to open out our Sahasrāra again.<br />
Through our meditative processes, through understanding ourselves and others, maybe logically reaching that point: ‘There’s no way out now. We have reached to the end of it now. The whole logic has ended up now. Jump in the Ocean of Love. Finished!'<br />
<b>Once you jump in the Ocean of Love there’s nothing to be done! Just to be enjoyed: every wave of it, every hue of it, every touch of it. That is what one has to learn by reasoning that, ‘Sahaja Yoga is nothing but is Love.'</b><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"And I [unclear] also, I just explained to you, <b>today is a day where, whatever you want to know of eternal nature, you can ask Me. And we'll ask for eternity.<br />

Beyond that, is eternity. So whatever you have to ask, you should ask for something that is eternal, is indust ... indestructible. That higher state, we should call the Permanent State of Joy and Bliss, is to be asked today. Because all other askings are useless. And you again go back to the position where you were.<br />
Is important to understand, that this time, today, you have to ask something eternal for yourself, something eternal for your family, something eternal for your country, and something eternal for this world and universe.<br />
<b>You all are Sahaja Yogis, and of a very high level, and I'm happy that the all of you have come here for that Eternal State of Devī.<br />

I cannot say this to people who are not Sahaja Yogis. But I can definitely say this to people who are Sahaja Yogis and who have achieved already Self-realization.<br />
So, today I hope, you all .. of you will pray and ask for that Eternal Love of God. It should flow to you all, all the time.<br />
May God bless you all."</font><br />

With that we have to understand that we enter into a new awareness.

You have to rise into that new realm, which is the Realm of God Almighty, what you call the Kingdom of God.<br />
And He said it very clearly to Nicodemus that, "You have to be born-again." And when he asked: "Am I to enter back into my mother's womb to be born again?" And He said it so clearly! It's so clear! Those who don't want to see can remain blind! But he said it very-very clearly that, "No! That is, whatever is born of the flesh is the flesh, but whatever is born of the Spirit is the Spirit."<br />
I mean, nothing could be more clear than that, that it has to be born of the Spirit."</font><br />

We will adulate Him by singing His praises<br />
<b>Hrudi mam basale prabhu majhe vijayi zhale</b><br />
He has now created a permanent abode in my heart because of His glorious victory over death.</font>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Now, as you know that He created all the Brahmāṇḍas. Brahman means an [a] universe.<br />
Now, the universe of the Sun, out of that universe has come out this Earth. Out of that you have come out.<br />
And in your Āgñyā chakra He has created a small Virāṭa, as they call it. He exists within your Āgñyā chakra.<br />
<b>This sacrifice is very, very significant. And, though it is gross, in subtle it has happened. To take the awareness through this center of Āgñyā was done by Christ, by His crucifixion.<br />
He came as a gross person, just like a gross human being.<br />
His body died, but did not die, because that body was also made of that imperishable Divine Vibrations, as you call, a Radiations or this Brahma. They did not die. And that's why the body did not die and He resurrected with His body.<br />
He had to die to show that the body though [it] dies, can be saved. That's why He had to be crucified.</b> Otherwise He could not have shown you.<br />
But it's actually it was experimented in the Vaikuṇṭha, as you call it, that He died and then resurrected to show that this does not die.<br />
Kṛiṣhṇa has said, "Nainaṃ chindanti śhastrāṇi, nainaṃ dahati pāvakaḥ" [Bhagavad Gītā 2.23, line 1]. "It is not killed by any weapon, neither it is burned by any fires, nor it is blown by any wind." "Na chainaṃ kledayanty āpo, na śhoṣhayati mārutaḥ"[Bhagavad Gītā 2.23, line 2]. "Neither, nothing can suck in." That Spirit is He.<br />
......<br />
But again you cannot crucify Him. Now He has become Ekādeśha Rudra as described, the Eleven Rudras as you know very well. These are all the Powers of Śhiva given to Him.<br />
<b>Up till now, till He was born, Kṛiṣhṇa had given Him His Powers, and that He became Mahāvirā[ṭ]. He was even placed above Kṛiṣhṇa.</b><br /> 
But now, when He will come, He'll be bestowed with the Destructive Powers of Śhiva, eleven of them. One is sufficient to finish all the universes. And that's what is described as the coming of the Christ. You cannot crucify Him anymore.<br />
And the time has come for all of us to be prepared for us to receive Him. We are not yet ready to receive Him. Unless and until you are realized, you cannot receive Him, because if you remain unrealized till He comes, you'll be finished, you'll be gone, you'll be destroyed. He'll just come to destroy all the nonsensical things. So this short time should be used for your emancipation and for your development.<br />
......<br />
<b>For us, Sahaja Yogis, it is important to understand the significance of Christ's life. That His body was the only body who was made of these Radiations.</b><br />
All other bodies were human bodies. All the Incarnations, even that of Kṛiṣhṇa's when He came on this Earth, were having human qualities that Mother Earth existed in the body."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Happy Easter to you all.</b><br />
So we celebrate Easter to show Christ resurrected Himself. The Spirit that is Christ has to resurrect out of the material manifestation of the Divine Itself. The matter is manifested because we ourselves have created it. Not that we are born out of matter, our body, but we are attached to it, we want it, we want to have it. Whatever you want, that sustains itself, by your desire, because now you are on the stage. If you want to sustain the matter, if you want to keep the matter as the first priority, it will remain. It cannot disappear. It has to go out of your mind that matter cannot hold you any further.<br />
Christ rose out of the matter, came out of the tomb which symbolizes the matter which has enclosed us within, which has to be opened out with our spiritual power. Throw away the stone that is covering this grave. Get out of that and stand outside it. This is the message of Christ's Resurrection."</font><br />

Now what is an egg?<br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are celebrating Hanumāna's Jayanti [birthday].</b><br />
What to say about Hanumāna? <b>The more powerful and wise, he was equally devoted and dedicated.</b> Generally, such a powerful person becomes right-sided and considers himself so high that he would not listen to anyone else. But <b>Hanumāna is a special Deity, a typical Deity full of qualities. There was a perfect balance between his devotion and power.</b> How could he achieve this balance is a thing to be understood.<br />
In Sahaja Yoga, when we are enlightened, we get many powers. Then we have to keep balance. We love others and with the power of the love, we keep on doing our duties.<br />
Śhrī Hanumāna was very powerful. He had many Divine Powers in Him Navadhā, that is Garima, Laghima, etc. He could be as big as he wanted to be and as small as an atom. He had achieved all these powers. Without attaining balance and coming to the central path. Such a powerful person generally goes crazy.<br />
<b>Each cell of Śhrī Hanumāna’s body was filled with power and devotion.</b> Because of this specialty today we worship Śhrī Hanumāna all over the world."</font><br />

There are thousands of examples in Sahaja Yoga. People call them miracles. But I say that it is no miracle, it is the blessing of Śhrī Hanumāna.<br /> 
<b>So My blessings and Love to you all. Love yourself, also love others.</b><br /> 
Do not confine your love to “my son, my this, my that.” No! Love means selfless love (Nirvāja Pyār) love that expects no return, love that is not confined to relations only. You have been blessed with such unfathomable Power of Love. Use it.<br />

Despite all these siddhis and the amount the [of] power He had, that Śhrī Rāma once asked Him that, “My s... My ah-ah-ah brother now, uh Lakṣhmaṇa, is being hit and He’s very sick. I mean, He’s just dying, so you go and get a particular kind of a sañjīvanī, a kind of a[n] herb, is which I want to rub on His head.” So He went there and He found He couldn’t find it so He brought the whole of the mountain on His hand and [laughing:] gave it to Rāma, “Now You select! I don’t know, I can’t find it.” [Soft laughter.]<br />
<b>That is the Hanumāna Śhakti! And with all that power, He was such a humble person and such a dedicated person.</b><br />

Obedience is the only thing that helps to carry out your work and you’ll become humbler and humbler.<br />
But if you think, ‘Oh I am doing this,’ then finished. <b>But if you know that it’s done by the Divine – ‘Paramachaitanya is doing everything, I am just an instrument,’ the humility will be there and you will be an effective instrument.</b>"</font><br />

The Shri Ganesha gives energy Shakti, but the one who protects is Shri Hanumana.

Also in a way that Shri Rama Himself becomes Shri Vishnu, so He has to look after Him."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Even though Saraswatī has created all the Swaras, so what! <b>But the emotions it contains, the bhakti it contains it is due to the blessings of Mahāvīr.</b> Mahāvīr has really worked hard for this because he scared people that if you go to the wrong way, you go to hell, and on taking this correct way you will be overwhelmed and you all are actually witnessing it. Like this <b>we all should increase our bhakti and growing bhakti in the work of Mahāvīr. I am happy that on this day of Mahāvīr Jayanti you all are doing Mahāvīr's work</b> ......<br />
In Sahaja Yoga we recognize Lord Mahāvīra as the Incarnation of Śhrī Bhairavnāth. He also incarnated as Imam Husayn. Saint Michael is the same who is also called Saint George [the Guardian angel of London]."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are going to do the Pūjā of Mahāvīra, and we never had this Pūjā before.</b><br />
Uh the reason for this was that Mahāvīra's life was an ascetic's life, ah just like Buddha -- even more than Buddha it would be -- uh because at the time when these two were born, the Brahminism of the Hinduism had taken a very funny form. People had become extremely ritualistic and they worsh... [were] worshiping all kinds of stones and all kinds of things instead of worshiping only the swayambhu."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are going to celebrate the birthday of Mahāvīra.<br />
Mahāvīra is the Incarnation of Bhairavanāth, or you call Him as Saint Michael.</b> Now these two Saints as you know one as the Gabriel, Hanumāna, and another is Saint Michael. One is placed on the Piṅgalā nāḍī and another one, Saint Michael, on the Iḍā nāḍī.<br />
So, Mahāvīra had to go through lots of search. Of course He was a[n] angel, but came as human being and He had to find out the thing of the left side, and how the left side acts. It's a very complicated thing, left side, is much more complicated than right side. On the left side we have also seven nāḍīs, and these seven nāḍīs are placed one after another. They are described in books and given different names to them. Now these seven nāḍīs that are on the left side, as you know, they cater to our past. Say for example, every moment becomes a past. Every present becomes a past. Then we have past of this lifetime, and also we have past of our previous lives. Then all the past is built in within us since our creation."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Śhrī Mahāvīr resides on our Iḍā nāḍī and rules it. All the saṃskāras that we have in us are corrected by Him.</b><br />
He has defined and explained what is Hell. What happens when human go to Hell and what and how they suffer in Hell, He has explained this in very detail.<br />
Buddha and Mahāvīr were samakālīn [contemporary] and both of Them had a life of penance. Both of Them were prince. But still both of Them dedicated themselves in tapasyā. And They found out that, 'When human make mistakes and go to the left side then how he goes in Hell and how he suffers.' "</font><br />

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>After they get their Realization, that He called as Kevalagyān: only the knowledge, only knowledge, means Pure Knowledge.</b> They will develop some Samyak Darśhan, means Integrated Personality and all the Collective Consciousness. He talked of all, all these things.<br /> 
But as He belonged to the left side, He has described Hell very clearly. Fundamentally, basically there are Fourteen Hells according to Him. And is horrible to read all that, what He has described about Hell. Because He wanted to tell people that, 'If you do all these wrong things, you'll go to Hell.'<br /> 
And He talked about, not about Form, Formly God, but Formless God, because He didn't want people to again start ritualism but get to right ... right to the position where they could get their Self-realization to cleanse themself.<br />
So you can imagine: how difficult, in those days at Mahāvīra, was even to be one of the candidates for Self-realization. It's frightening for you! <b>That's why I never had this uh Pūjā. Because to do all these things, first of all, and to become absolutely pure, then only He would give Realization.</b>"</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>In Sahaj we very much respect and understand Mahāvīrjī and we also accept that He is the Incarnation of Śhrī Bhairavnāth and not only this, [but] He took birth many times and later also came as Hasan and Husayn. In Bible Bhairavnāthjī is addressed as Saint Georg and some refer Him as Saint Michael.</b><br />
It is very surprising that London which we understand as Heart has Saint George as its angel. That is! They accept Bhairavnāth so it's correct. Because if Śhivjī resides in heart then having Bhairavnāth is important.<br />
There are so many things which if we read with understanding then they are all interconnected and how is there relation automatically established.<br />
<b>In Sahaj Śhakti you get overwhelmed and you enjoy it and this makes Me happy. God has created this universe for you so you should enjoy it, what else do you want?</b> In you there are many powers and you use them and you have also shared it with others.<br />
In this way <b>the family of our Sahaj should grow. We should save as many possible, most important our children. We should take care of them because a wrong type of culture has started and the children are getting affected. So we should pay attention to it and to them and take care of them.</b> When they are established in Sahaj, then they will not go around."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"The ascetic life of Mahāvīra was of a very, very extreme nature. He was the one who was born in a ... uh ... clan of warriors, Kṣhatriyas. And then He was also married, also He had a daughter. And then He decided, because He knew He had to do the work of the Divine, He decided to take a saṃnyāsa. So He took uh the permission of His brother because His parents were dead. He was a king, so He gave up all His uh material wealth, everything and He beg ... became a complete saṃnyāsī. And the He left His family, His left His ... house, everything behind and went alone with a little bowl for begging alms. And there people who joined Him were very few, and He asked them that, "You have to also become ascetics," Munis.<br />
He was a Reincarnation of Saint Michael and He resides on the left side, on the Iḍā nāḍī. And He looks after the whole of it, right from Mūlādhāra onwards up to the Sahasrāra. <b>So Saint Michael was born as Mahāvīra, meaning The Greatest Warrior. But when He was born, the whole place got lot of uh prosperity, that's why He was called as Vardhamān, to begin with.</b><br />
But His asceticism was there because of the Brahminism that was so prevalent in those days, and people were absolutely drowned into it."</font><br />

And His idea is, I think that way, is to now fully go all the way to clear the left side as far as possible, to help Sahaja Yoga to establish in countries where I find still lot of this negativity is there – a lot of it.<br />
So He’s working it out, everywhere, and the psychosomatic diseases and all these diseases also, we can work it out with candle-light and all that, with three candles we can do this treatment.<br />
