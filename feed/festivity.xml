<font color="DarkRed">"<b>It’s a great thing today that we are celebrating the Virgin’s worship</b> in England.<br />
As you know, according to Sahaja Yoga, England is the heart where resides the Spirit of Śhiva. And that Virgin should be respected and revered, uh worshiped in England is a great honor, I think, for all the Sahaja Yogis.<br />
Now one has to think, ‘Why such an importance is paid to a Virgin? Why a Virgin is respected ... to that extent? What are the Powers of a Virgin?’ That She can bear a child of that magnitude that was Christ, that She could create Śhrī Gaṇeśha out of Her own body, that She could protect innocent, dynamic force of Her children who are egoless, who have not known what is ego.<br />
So this Great Power and Force resides in a person who has lots of puru [many, abundant] puṇyas, who has done lots of good things in previous lives, who has always understood that Virginity is a power higher than any other power and would save the Virginity and Chastity with all Her effort and care.<br />
As you know that, within our body, She is placed as Kuṇḍalinī. [It] means She is the Virgin. She is untouched. The desire to become Spirit is without any blemish: nirmala. There is no blemish. I[t]s waiting is pure. There’s no other desire, but to be one with the Divine. All other desires are finished."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is the first day of Navarātri. Today your attention should be on Śhrī Gaṇeśha.</b> His devotion is infinite.<br />
He has never worshiped anybody else except Mother. Hence He is so great. All other Gods appear very strong. Everyone has some specialty. What is Mother’s specialty? Her ego (aham) is nowhere felt by others. Hence Śhrī Gaṇeśha who has surrendered to such Mother is so wise and venerable, Mother has nothing with Her. Her very name begins with Ni, e.g., Niṣhakāñchan[ā] having no wealth, Nirlepā unaffected; Nirvichārā thoughtless; Niṣhprayojanā having no motives, Nigarvitā egoless, Niricchā desireless, etc. Therefore, surrendering to such Mother, who has nothing with Her, needs some kind of subtle thought, in that, Mother has nothing with Her, and therefore, nothing can be asked from Her. It shows how Śhrī Gaṇeśha by himself is fully satisfied. Where does this contentment of Śhrī Gaṇeśha come from? It is own power."</font><br />

The Himalayas are the Sahasrāra that Mother Earth has created for you. This Sahasrāra is to be worshiped. This Sahasrāra is very great. I don't know if you can see vibrations emitting from it.

[King] Dakṣha did not invite Lord Śhiva in the Havana that he performed and Śhailaputrī was the consort of Lord Śhiva. She is called Satī because She entered the Holy fire of Havana and ablated Herself. But by then Lord Śhiva reached there. He lifted her burnt up body from the fire. Burnt pieces of the body of Śhailaputrī fell at many places. All these places are considered to be Śhakti Pīṭhas, the places of worship, as there is in Vindhyāchala and many other places. Her power moves there and it is said that it Sanctifies everything. Her seventh power is considered to be the Power of Destruction. Śhakti manifested Itself on the right side as Sāvitrī and Gāyatrī but the destroying force was manifested in the center. In the form of Durgā and Her other forms manifested in Heart chakra.

<font color="DarkRed">"So the ascent starts evolving. In that, the play of the Devī is the Navarātri – in your ascent – from ages. <b>Navarātri that’s why is the most important Pūjā. In Sahaja Yoga, Navarātri is the most important Pūjā, I would say.</b> Though we can say in modern Sahaja Yoga Sahasrār Day is, because that’s how you started getting your Realization. But if you go to the whole historical events of evolution you’ll find  Navarātri is the one which has brought you to Sahasrāra. Without the help of the Devī at different stages of your ascent, you could not have been in a position to receive your Realization. So all the steps that you took in the past are today worshiped and are used for thanking the Devī for what She did to bring you down here. So it’s like a thanksgiving.

<b>Sahaja Yogi:</b> Anant Chaturdaśhī.<br />
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> <font color="DarkRed">Today? Aah-ha! That's great! Yes must be. I was wondering Anant Chaturdaśhī. Anant Chaturdaśhī is the day when we visarjan, dissolve Śhrī Gaṇeśha in the water. Gaṇeśhjī ko choṛate hai na pānī meṃ [it's that day we put Gaṇeśhjī in to the water]. Because He's established for ten days. And after ten days, He's born on the fourth, after ten days He's dissolved in the water so that everywhere His Power is spread through the water.</font><br />
T<font color="DarkRed">hat's why no wonder there was a Pūjā.</font> [Laughter.]<br />
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Gaṇeśha settled down into the water. [Laughs.] That is Ananta Chaturdaśhī. Ananta is the, is Śhrī Gaṇeśha. Ananta means which cannot be destroyed. Innocence cannot be destroyed.</b> And that is why is the Gaṇeśh Chaturdaśhī, means the day when Gaṇeśha is dissolved in the water, in the ocean or He is created, worshiped for ten days and again given back. So it's a very great day today, I should say, like the Resurrection of Christ that you are, you had Christ here, He lived with you, and then went back to His Father. Father is the ocean and that's what in India they do, to establish Him on the fourth day and on the tenth day they put Him back to the ocean.</font><br />

Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the first Deity that was created so that the whole Universe is filled with auspiciousness, with peace, bliss, and spirituality. He is the Source. He’s the Source of Spirituality.

When you direct your attention to the source, you worship it, and when you want to incite or open out your own being, then you chant it. This is the difference between worship and a mantra.

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So we have to first find out if the person is worthy of Pūjā or not. If the person is not worthy, it is better to leave the person alone till he becomes worthy of the Pūjā because doubts and all those things can obstruct the flow of vibrations to other people and such a person can create a problem for others. So it is not civil of that person also to be in the Pūjā if the person has not got an open heart and understanding of what Pūjā is. <b>Doing Pūjā to any Deity as such is not an easy thing, especially to Śhrī Gaṇeśha.</b> Those people who do Pūjā to Śhrī Gaṇeśha should know that of course it has to be a swayambhu means the one that is created by Mother Earth. No other than Gaṇeśha should be worshiped. And if they are not a realized Soul they can never worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha. They cannot even think of Him, they cannot even take His name, it is so difficult to reach Śhrī Gaṇeśha. <b>But after Realization, the first thing you have to do is to worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha because that’s the base on which you got your Realization.</b> He’s the One first who got His crucifixion then His Resurrection and it is the One who opened the path of Realization for you. So you have to worship Him before any other Deity with the greatest sacrifices."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"But one has to realize that the message of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was to surrender.<br />
Now the surrendering that we think in the gross way is like an enemy surrenders to another enemy. So, when the word surrender is spoken, we build up our barriers by thinking that, 'Now, we have to surrender, leave something to the other party.'<br />
But when Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa talked about surrender, He was saying that, 'Surrender your enemies to Me so that I will get rid of them.'<br />
Now, the worst enemy that we have is our ego. And with ego starts all kinds of other problems, because it is the biggest barrier for our growth. And the ego starts, as you know, from the Viśhuddhi chakra and can be sucked into Viśhuddhi chakra away. Now let us see how this Viśhuddhi chakra made is. All the vowels that we use come from Viśhuddhi chakra."</font><br />

<font color="blue">"<b>Is so important, that on this day if this is tied on your wrist, then you become brothers and sisters.</b><br />
Now, <b>in Sahaja Yoga brotherhood is the most important.</b> That is the friendliness among ourselves. When you are very good brothers and sisters, first of all, your left Viśhuddhi improves.<br />
This left Viśhuddhi. You get this left Viśhuddhi, because we don't have proper brother and sister relationship. Is not that we should have our own sister, but any woman who is a Sahaja Yoginī is your sister. Except for your own wife.<br />
And this is the feeling. Unless and until we develop that pure feeling within ourselves, we cannot work out Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yoga cannot be worked out. I know it's rather difficult to digest, but is a fact. You have to feel clean and pure within your heart."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today in India, we celebrate a set ... special festival. It is called as Rakṣhā-bandhan.</b> Rakṣhā means protection and bandhan means the bondage: the bondage of protection. Is a very nice, good, social custom to have this beautiful festival today.<br />
Today is the Full Moon Day, and this day what we do is to tie a band of threads around the person whom you want to protect. But it is done between brothers and sisters."</font><br />

<font color="blue">"<b>So, this day is uh extremely important, in a way, for Sahaja Yogis to observe, and I’m happy that I am here, because it’s very important also for America.</b><br />
Uh as I told you that, I have already talked to you how the war between Alexander and Puru was finished because of a sister’s intervention.<br />
And, also, how Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, whose sister was Draupadī, Viṣhṇumāyā was born as Draupadī, and how He came to save Her chastity, by rushing all the way from Dvārika.<br />
So, we can see that when we ascend in the Collective Consciousness and we have a collective living, collective meeting, at the Viśhuddhi chakra, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa establish this, or He manifested uh this pure relationship of a sister.<br />
In a collective life that we have, in the Āśhram where we live, where we move about as Sahaja Yogis, if we do not have this basic principle within us, there will be a chaos, complete chaos. Once this purity of relationship is established, that apart from my wife, all the rest are my sisters or mothers, it cannot be a proper society and the chaos of the social system of America is because they have no sense of pure relationships.<br />
<b>Once you call somebody a sister, she’s a sister. And once you call somebody a brother, he’s a brother. It’s not only that you should be born of the same parents, it’s not necessary, but this is a very important principle to have a very pure society where everybody can live peacefully.</b>"</font><br />

And, all of you should also <b>understand that it's a very subtle, pure, beautiful relationship that exists between a brother and a sister.</b>"</font><br />

<p>
<font color="blue">"So apart from ego and superego, the worst thing that has happened to these modern societies is that, that they have lost their innate understanding of purity.<br />
That innate understanding in Sahaja Yoga now you have got it. So try to develop it and flower it, so the fragrance of that innocence will make each other very happy and such a kind of a security. One feels so secure.<br />
And that’s why it is <b>a rakṣhābandhan, the protection of a brother and protection of a sister.<br />
All the time you know, my brother is there, after all, my sister is there. A kind of a very pure, beautiful feeling, that, ‘I have somebody to protect me.’</b><br />
And this beautiful feeling, if it’s nurtured, looked after, in a wider way in Sahaja Yoga, then you feel absolutely, absolutely secure."</font><br />

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Rākhī is Protecting Power.</b><br /> 
Its bond is very strong and extremely tender because it symbolizes the noble love of sister. Customarily, tying a rākhī to someone is establishing a place of Pure Protection. However, man's ability to understand love has become so feeble that tying of rākhī has become merely a mechanical process. All beautiful human traditions become lifeless and dry formalities if there is no warmth of faith in them.<br />
......<br />
<b>Rakhi Pūrnimā is a day of great significance.<br />
On that day you should ask for perfection, make big decisions and keep attention on high ideals.</b><br />
Sahaja Yogis should not destroy their attention on trifle issues.<br />
Lot of work has yet to be done.<br />
Those Sahaja Yogis who have progressed should get busy.<br />
New centers should be opened.<br />
<b>People should be cured of their diseases and their attention should be drawn towards God-realization.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Today is the day of Guru Pūrṇimā. It is a Full Moon Day, that’s why it’s called as Pūrṇimā. The guru has to be like a Full Moon, means completely grown, completely matured.<br />
......<br /> 
Now we have to understand the importance of guru. Why should we have a guru when we have God? We’ve got Śhakti, then why should we have a guru? What is the need to have a guru? Guru means ‘the weight’, the weight. We get our weight from the magnetic forces of the gravity of the Mother Earth. So guru means gravity, gravity in a person. Why do we need a guru? Because to know God is easy, specially in Sahaja Yoga, to be one with Him. <b>As soon as you get your Self-realization in Sahaja Yoga, the modern Sahaja Yoga, immediately you become entitled to give Realizations to other. It was said that guru is the person who makes you meet the Divine. That’s not true, because any self-realized person in the Sahaja Yoga can raise the Kuṇḍalinī and can give Self-realization to others, immediately after they have touched the Sahasrāra or opened the Sahasrāra. But normally a realized Soul cannot do it. Any born realized Soul cannot do it on its own, it has to have authority of Me as I am today.</b><br />
That’s why it was said that guru is a person who makes you meet God; he raises the Kuṇḍalinī and makes you one with God. Because in those days when the gurus were self-realized when the gurus were realized, they had the authority and power of raising the Kuṇḍalinī only after they had reached a very great state of evolution – complete purification, complete detachment."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Today is a great day, for all of us, because we are celebrating the Guru Pūjā and remembering all the Great Gurus who came on Earth to teach the world about the Truth. So many of Them were here. And They tried Their level best to explain to humanity what is spirituality.<br />
But is such a disparity that people never understood that spirituality is the most important thing we need, that we have to be one with the Divine Power."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"As today’s day is great, because we are thinking of all the great Saints who came on this Earth and who tried to lead us. What they did, all of them tried to spread the Truth all over the world. They suffered a lot, they had problems, so many problems, but they worked very hard in every way to spread Sahaja Yoga and talk about God and Divinity.<br />
All that is what today you have to give Me, a promise, that whenever you get any other human being, you can tell them about Sahaja Yoga. Not that it’s important but it’s absolutely immediate need of the world. If you understand this point, that at this time, why are you in this world and what is the need of the world, you will immediately start feeling the responsibility. Whether you are a man or a woman is not important.<br />
<b>Go all out to preach, think, make people understand about Sahaja Yoga in every way that is possible, and I think, then, you will become complete as gurus. If Sahaja Yoga is just with you, you cannot be a guru. ‘Guru’ also doesn’t mean that you go on preaching about Sahaja Yoga, talking about Sahaja Yoga, giving lectures about Sahaja Yoga, no! It means the one who gives Realizations to others.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Sahaja Yoga is very different from all other gurus that we believe in the Power of Love. Power of Love teaches you how to be forgiving, it makes you noble, it makes you very balanced.<br />
<b>So, the gurus who were there for Bhavasāgara, to establish dharma in the human beings, first thing, they had to balance themselves against all practical things, as they call it.</b> They think is not practical!<br />
But they said, “No! For us, this is higher, nobler, and important.” <b>So they would balance people because they had this Power of Love within themselves. All these Ādi Gurus and Their Incarnations, if you see Them, They always had balance and always prayed ... praised the Love of God.</b>"</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Is a very important day, because as a Guru Pūjā, they say that a guru cannot give anything to you. But I can give you the advice, and the advice that you enlarge your heart, you become humble, and try to spread Sahaja Yoga with humility, not with aggressiveness. That is extremely important. If you can do that, then you’ll do full justice to this life, which is a spiritual life. Without that you cannot achieve, you cannot achieve, the strength of spirituality.<br />
For that you have to understand that it’s very, very important that you should give Sahaja Yoga a full chance, through your wisdom."</font><br />
