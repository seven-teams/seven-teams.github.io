<font color="DarkRed">"Today is <b>the last day of Navarātri</b>. And this should be the culminating point for all of us. As you see, within us lie, as you know that there are seven chakras for you ascent and two above it. So all these Nine Chakras are to be crossed in this lifetime. That should be your destiny.<br />
But if you people go only on the Āgñyā move on Āgñyā, you cannot rise any higher. People have been lost on that chakra. So, that's a very important chakra for ......<br />
Sixth, Ṣhaṣhṭhī of the Goddess, is regarded as a very important thing and they say that, `Goddess comes on a nāv,' on a boat, Calcutta [Kolkata] people believe it because the sixth day is very big to cross it. That is what today is the problem with all of us that we have this sixth day still sitting on our heads and we cannot get out it. So to come to the ninth stage, though we may do Pūjā, we may do anything, but we are still on the sixth. So it is just outwardly that we are doing Pūjā. Seventh day is the day, where I am there. But 7th and 8th and 9th has to be achieved by crossing your sixth."</font><br />

Laghima is to become small, Mahima is to have a big form, Īśhatva is to create Gods out of human beings, Vaśhitva is the attraction, Prākāmya is the manifestation, Bhukti is the enjoyment, [Icchā] fulfillment of desire.

<font color="DarkRed">"These are the things you must understand. Why are you doing that and try to get rid of it and try to improve yourself, be alert and to receive it. Receive it as much as you can. This is what is the Pūjā is made for.<br />
Now you have had nine Pūjās here and out of these nine Pūjās have we improved more, have we got more? Did we fill ourselves more with greater love, with greater joy, with greater understanding and with greater satisfaction?<br />
<b>This is the last day, so you have to think like that, then tomorrow is the day of jubilation.</b> Because we have done what? That is what. So today you should go and make a complete picture of yourself. What have I got in these nine days? What have I got? Let us see, have I got this? Have I got that? All these things, you should just within yourself see and then enjoy that you have got all these things. It is the victory. Tomorrow is the day of victory.

So your only work is, or your only method is just to concentrate on the Pūjā and witness. You are a Seer. Seer has double meaning. The one who sees only, just sees, and is only knowledge is a Seer. Without any thought, without any reaction, just sees and absorb[s] automatically, spontaneously -- is the Seer. And so, that is the best way to perform a Pūjā.<br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Today we are going to do Pūjā for Navarātri.<br />
Yesterday you saw, beautiful description of Navarātri and how the Mother Goddess has created all kinds of powers within you. It's not that only She has the powers, but you all have the powers, and you can all work it out, you can all find out whether these powers are there or not.<br />
<b>With us, the Realization is very important, but there the Kuṇḍalinī has given you this Realization. Of course Kuṇḍalinī is a part or, we can say, reflection of Ādi Śhakti, and also the Jagadambā is also part of Ādi Śhakti.</b><br />
She's placed in the center of two hearts, which is a very important point. Now all these powers are placed in that chakra. So you imagine how many of these powers must be there, and Her Powers are expressed through the center Heart in all the gaṇas you have around your body. Now these gaṇas are the ones who do give you the protection, give you the sleep, give you the energy, give you the blessings. All of them are at work all the time, and these bodies are extremely dedicated and connected all the time to the Mother Ambā, we can call Jagadambā. Now She is the Mother of the Universe, so you can imagine, how busy She has to be to look after the whole Universe! "</font><br />

Specially, the One we know of Jagadambā, the Durgā, She was trying to protect all the Seekers of Truth and to destroy all evil forces.&gt;<br />
Because without the ascent of human beings, they do not know the Truth. And that's why, whatever they try to do is a mental projection.&gt;<br />
And this mental projection, if it is not sumsti ... substantiated by Truth, by dharma, it declines. In Sanskrit they call it glāni.&gt;<br />
When this glāni takes place, then Incarnations are born to solve the problem."</font><br />

And these Deities are to be awakened within you. Deities are the different aspects of One God. So, on one side you have the Deities -- is the aspects of God, which are all the time awakened. On the other side you have your own Deities, which are sometimes awakened, sometimes half awakened, sometimes sleeping and sometimes sick. [Laughter.] So, you have to use two methods -- one to please the Deities of God and to ask them to bless your Deities or to ask them to awaken your Deities."</font><br />

On one side She was Ocean of Love and Compassion, and on the other side She was protecting them like a tigress; because the times were such that nobody could meditate, nobody could take the name of God, nobody could think even of Self-realization. But those who are sitting here today, you have been there also in those days, and you were all saved for today, for this day, so that you can achieve your Self-realization.<br />
The form of the Goddess in those days was not Māyā Swarūpi[n]. She was in Her real form and that created a great awe, even among the disciples. So the question of giving them Self-realization was not there. First of all they were to be saved."</font><br />

So you take the kavach. Kavach is something you can say that people wear those armor, inside, you see that sort of a thing, is kavach. So you must take that before going out or talking to somebody. That you don't do.<br />
......<br />
It's just a simple thing, take your kavach when you are going out. It's so simple, I mean, in Sahaja Yoga we don't have to do horrible rituals that people do, nothing of the kind. Just take your bandhan in the morning when you are going out and if somebody is argumentative just give a bandhan.

What you have to do is to only be in silence so that you absorb whatever will increase that silence, will increase your depth.

Enjoyment is only possible when you are beyond your mind. With your mind you can never enjoy, it is like a big load. It will not act, it will not help.

<font color="DarkRed">"Now, when we are <b>celebrating the greatest of greatest this Navarātri</b>, there must be something special about it, that we have to cleanse this heart completely, fully and make it so pure that it purifies all the blood that passes through the whole of the body. So the cells of this heart, which has made this great organ, has to be the best, because the cells of the heart within a human body are the best cells, the highest quality, the most sensitive. And it's the heart that expresses the Anāhata, the sound that is without percussion.<br />
......<br />
...... <b>this is the highest Pūjā, the greatest ritual, which you can attend</b>. So why do we do Navarātri? In the heart, to do Navarātri is to accept the Powers of the Śhakti, to realize the power that all these chakras have got in themselves, and that when they are enlightened how you can express all these powers of these Nine Chakras within ourselves; the seven chakras plus the heart and the Moon makes it nine."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"This was a binding love. She could not escape it. <b>Mother's Love is binding. She cannot escape it. And She has to manifest it, work it out, and give that protection to all Her children.</b><br />
This protection in the modern times has taken another form.<br />
In those days, the evil was trying to harm, to destroy the people who were righteous, who were bhaktas, who were doing good things, who wanted to lead a very religious life. So <b>to save them, She incarnated. To protect them, She incarnated.</b> But they knew what was good, they knew what was wrong. And they wanted to preserve their good life, their precious life. They didn't care for money, they didn't care for power, but just they wanted their life, means they wanted to be alive to worship the Goddess. And when they were troubled or harmed or destroyed by these evil forces, She had to manifest.<br />
But in modern times, it's become very complicated, as the modern times are complicated. First of all, in the mind, in the lifestyle, in the society, of good human beings, righteous human beings, fear of the wrong has entered.<br />
Like, they are afraid, say, of their pries-sts [priests], of their churches, of their temples, of their mosques, which are all false! They are not afraid of God.<br />
They don't believe in God. They think that they have created God, and they can manage God. 'So who is God?' The way they behave, you can see clearly, that they do not recognize the existence of God, God Almighty who is a wrathful God. They are not at all worried as to what will happen to them."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"So the ascent starts evolving. In that, the play of the Devī is the Navarātri -- in your ascent -- from ages. <b>Navarātri that's why is the most important Pūjā. In Sahaja Yoga, Navarātri is the most important Pūjā, I would say. Though we can say in modern Sahaja Yoga Sahasrār Day is, because that's how you started getting your Realization. But if you go to the whole historical events of evolution you'll find [that] Navarātri is the one which has brought you to Sahasrāra. Without the help of the Devī at different stages of your ascent, you could not have been in a position to receive your Realization. So all the steps that you took in the past are today worshiped and are used for thanking the Devī for what She did to bring you down here. So it's like a thanksgiving. Without Her work, nothing could have happened.</b><br />
So when we read about the Devī, about Her Incarnations -- how She came on this Earth to save Her bhaktas, people who were trying to ascend, to cross this Bhavasāgara, how She worked hard, how She fought the devils, how She cough... She killed the demons, single-handed -- She took upon Herself the responsibility of making the people cross the Bhavasāgara.<br />
<b>Guru gave you the strength to have dharma but She is the One who brought you out. Even those who were dhārmik could not do it because of the demonic pressure.

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now what happens actually when you project this Pūjā?</b><br />
It has been found out, and now as I am telling you, <b>that first you have to awaken within you the Deities that are still asleep, by worshiping them. But as these Deities, Primordial Deities, are with Me, you worship Me, and every Deity in Me is awakened, by which your Deities are awakened.<br />
So first, your vibrations must improve, to receive. If the reception is not good what's the use of any Pūjā or projection?</b> So first of all we, sort of, prepare our instrument, or prepare our projecting instrument. That preparation is done by praying to different Deities, as we call that: a Kuṇḍalinī Pūjā. By praying to My Kuṇḍalinī you improve your reflection. Because then the vibrations from Me start flowing into yours and they awaken it. This is the projection as far as you are concerned.<br />
Once the instrument is all right, then you project outside. <b>And now how do you project? By worshiping the Goddess as the Protector of the whole Universe, praising Her different attributes, even Her Face, Her Hands, everything has a meaning. Praising Her Powers. By saying that, by repeating that, you echo in your projection Her Powers, and then your projection becomes that powerful.</b> It's a very subtle happening that takes place, it's miraculous. <b>These things look so simple, like just like washing My Feet.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"...... <b>Navarātri is very good because these nine nights represent the main Nine Incarnations</b>. Where the Goddess took the form of Śhakti and killed the negative people.<br />
But those were easier days because negativity was understood by people and nobody sympathized.<br />
So this is what one has to understand that don't sympathize with negativity. You'll spoil them all. And always you'll find such sympathies bring forth your character also that you are also slightly negative.<br />
Because to fight negativity in modern times is a very difficult task. You cannot kill anyone: if you kill somebody, then may be that such a person is a brother or a sister or something of somebody. Or such a person would be himself or herself a seeker.<br />
So best thing is to separate like a contagious disease, keep that person out, no sympathies. And get the person cured and enjoy the life, otherwise that person is not going to be helped. It has become a very individual fight. And it's so troublesome and so disgusting.<br />
So to help Me out, you should not take any sides with negativity. That's how you can help Me the most. <b>This is what it is the Navarātri, the Pūjā that I give you powers to fight the negativity. That's how you cure people.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Today is the first day of Navarātri. Today your attention should be on Śhrī Gaṇeśha.</b> His devotion is infinite. He has never worshiped anybody else except Mother. Hence He is so great. All other Gods appear very strong. Everyone has some specialty. What is Mother's specialty? Her ego (aham) is nowhere felt by others. Hence Śhrī Gaṇeśha who has surrendered to such Mother, is so wise and venerable, Mother has nothing with Her. Her very name begins with Ni, e.g., Niṣhakāñchan[ā] having no wealth, Nirlepā unaffected; Nirvichārā thoughtless; Niṣhprayojanā having no motives, Nigarvitā egoless, Niricchā desireless, etc. Therefore, surrendering to such Mother, who has nothing with Her, needs some kind of subtle thought, in that, Mother has nothing with Her and therefore, nothing can be asked from Her.

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>On this day Devī is worshiped as Śhailaputrī, means the daughter of Himalaya.</b> Devī has many other names also but first of all She incarnated as Śhailaputrī in the cold of Himalayas. She incarnated and whatever She was to do, She started there.<br />
Further story is known to you. [King] Dakṣha did not invite Lord Śhiva in the Havana that he performed and Śhailaputrī was the consort of Lord Śhiva. She is called Satī because She entered the Holy fire of Havana and ablated Herself. But by then Lord Śhiva reached there. He lifted Her burnt up body from the fire. Burnt pieces of the body of Śhailaputrī fell at many places. All these places are considered to be Śhakti Pīṭhas, the places of worship, as there is in Vindhyāchala and many other places. Her power moves there and it is said that it Sanctifies everything.<br />
Her seventh power is considered to be the Power of Destruction. Śhakti manifested Itself on the right side as Sāvitrī and Gāyatrī but the destroying force was manifested in the center.<br />
In the form of Durgā and Her other forms manifested in Heart chakra. She is present there.<br />
If some one hurts you, confuses or disturbs you then this power will protect you and destroy your enemy."</font><br />

You, people, are similar but with a slight difference. You and your desire powers are different. First, the power of your desire is born. Until you have a desire for anything, nothing is executed.<br />
This means [that] this beautiful universe is created because of someone's desire. Everything is executed after a desire. To execute the desire of God Almighty it has to be separated from Him. We will call it Ādi Śhakti.<br />
When this first stage arrived this Ghaṭasthāpanā happened. This happened so many times in ancient times and even today when we have Ghaṭasthāpanā we memorize that aboriginal happening. So on the first day of Navarātri, we do Ghaṭasthāpanā, means, remember, what an important thing it is.</b><br />
Whatever God Almighty desired at that time collected and filled in a Ghaṭ before its execution. Today we are worshiping that desire, we worshiped it today.

A Pūjā or a prayer grows from your heart. Mantras are the words of your Kuṇḍalinī. But if Pūjā is not performed from heart or if Kuṇḍalinī is not associated with recitation of Mantras then that Pūjā becomes a ritual.<br />
If you become thoughtless in Pūjā, know that your heart is also involved in it. <b>Collect the Pūjā material and offer it sincerely. There should be no formality or bindings in the offerings.</b> It is correct to wash hands, but is your heart washed? When attention is on heart it does not go to others. Although you remain quiet from outside, you are speaking from within. Hence you should not, be silent for long time. If man's heart is not clean, then the silence becomes very harmful. At the same time loose talks can bring catastrophes.<br />
You should say the Mantras in Pūjā but with great faith (śhraddhā). There is no alternative to śhraddhā. You should perform the Pūjā when śhraddhā grows deep, so that heart itself gets all Pūjā performed."</font><br />

Sahaja Yogi: Anant Chaturdaśhī.<br />
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b> Today? Ah-ah! That’s great! Yes must be. I was wondering Anant Chaturdaśhī. <b>Anant Chaturdaśhī is the day when we visarjan – dissolve Śhrī Gaṇeśha in the water.</b><br />
Gaṇeśhjī ko chodte hai na pani mein – it’s that day we put the Gaṇeśha in to the water.<br />
Because <b>He’s established for ten days and after ten days</b>, He’s born on the fourth, after ten days He’s dissolved in the water so that everywhere His Power is spread through the water.<br />
That’s why no wonder there was a Pūjā.<br />
Gaṇeśha settled down into the water. That is Ananta Chaturdaśhī. Ananta is the, is Śhrī Gaṇeśha.<br />
Ananta means which cannot be destroyed. Innocence cannot be destroyed. And that is why is the Gaṇeśh Chaturdaśhī means the day when Gaṇeśha is dissolved in the water, in the ocean or He is created, worshiped for ten days and again given back. So it’s a very great day today, I should say, like the Resurrection of Christ that you are, you had Christ here, He lived with you, and then went back to His Father. Father is the ocean and that’s what in India they do, <b>establish Him on the fourth day and on the tenth day they put Him back to the ocean</b>."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"So today first we have Gaṇeśh Pūjā because Gaṇeśha is innocence and we have to establish Him in any place where is, want to start our work or do anything about it, because He is innocence and innocence was created before everything else was created.

And by taking water out of it you clear all the problems of your five elements which are in the control of the creator himself. So My Feet are the more important; they can cure your ailments of the five elements; even mental ailments are cured because that part of you is formed from ākāśh, the firmament."</font><br />
