<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are celebrating Hanumāna's Jayanti [birthday].</b><br />
What to say about Hanumāna? <b>The more powerful and wise, he was equally devoted and dedicated.</b> Generally, such a powerful person becomes right-sided and considers himself so high that he would not listen to anyone else. But <b>Hanumāna is a special Deity, a typical Deity full of qualities. There was a perfect balance between his devotion and power.</b> How could he achieve this balance is a thing to be understood.<br />
In Sahaja Yoga, when we are enlightened, we get many powers. Then we have to keep balance. We love others and with the power of the love, we keep on doing our duties.<br />
Śhrī Hanumāna was very powerful. He had many Divine Powers in Him Navadhā, that is Garima, Laghima, etc. He could be as big as he wanted to be and as small as an atom. He had achieved all these powers. Without attaining balance and coming to the central path. Such a powerful person generally goes crazy.<br />
<b>Each cell of Śhrī Hanumāna’s body was filled with power and devotion.</b> Because of this specialty today we worship Śhrī Hanumāna all over the world."</font><br />

<font color="blue">"<b>Today we have come here to do Hanumāna’s Pūjā.</b><br />
Śhrī Hanumāna is a great character in our being and He runs all the way from Swādhiṣhṭhāna to your brain 
and He supplies all the necessary guidance we need in our futuristic planning or in our mental activities. <b>He gives us guidance and protection.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="chocolate"><b>You control people who have too much right side.
You bring down the speed of right-sided people (by giving them lethargic heaviness).
You hold a mace (the gada) in Your hand to reduce our illusions.
You are the source of enthusiasm.
Through Your bhakti (ocean of love) we may use Your fire. 
In this way, we may act without heating up our right side.</b></font><br />

<p>
<font color="blue">"<b>What we have to learn from Śhrī Hanumāna is this devotion (bhakti) and the power that he has given to you. If your devotion is real, then no one dares touch you. No one could touch.</b><br />
There are thousands of examples in Sahaja Yoga. People call them miracles. But I say that it is no miracle, it is the blessing of Śhrī Hanumāna.<br /> 
<b>So My blessings and Love to you all. Love yourself, also love others.</b><br /> 
Do not confine your love to “my son, my this, my that.” No! Love means selfless love (Nirvāja Pyār) love that expects no return, love that is not confined to relations only. You have been blessed with such unfathomable Power of Love. Use it.<br />
Infinite blessings."</font><br />

<font color="blue">"It is such a joy today, and the whole atmosphere seems to be bubbling with it as if the angels are singing.<br />
And <b>the specialty of Hanumāna was that He was an angel.</b> Angels are born like angels. They are angels, and they are not human beings.<br /> 
They’re born with the angelic qualities. But now, you all have become angels from the human beings. It’s a very great achievement of Sahaja Yoga.<br /> 
The qualities that are born with the angels are seen from their very childhood."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Hanumāna’s whole life was spent in serving Śhrī Rām. And He was such a dedicated bhakta of Śhrī Rām.</b><br />
Now here the contrast is also that Hanumāna had Navadhā, Navadhā uh-uh Siddhis, Navadhā Siddhis, Nine Siddhis: the Aṇima, Garima, Raguma [Laghima], and all sorts of things, that He could become small, He could become big, He could ... it so many things He had. Despite all these siddhis and the amount the [of] power He had, that Śhrī Rāma once asked Him that, “My s... My ah-ah-ah brother now, uh Lakṣhmaṇa, is being hit and He’s very sick. I mean, He’s just dying, so you go and get a particular kind of a sañjīvanī, a kind of a[n] herb, is which I want to rub on His head.” So He went there and He found He couldn’t find it so He brought the whole of the mountain on His hand and [laughing:] gave it to Rāma, “Now You select! I don’t know, I can’t find it.” [Soft laughter.]<br />
<b>That is the Hanumāna Śhakti! And with all that power, He was such a humble person and such a dedicated person.</b><br />
<b>This is the sign of a powerful Sahaja Yogi. Anybody who is powerful has to be humble and nonviolent.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Even though Saraswatī has created all the Swaras, so what! <b>But the emotions it contains, the bhakti it contains it is due to the blessings of Mahāvīr.</b> Mahāvīr has really worked hard for this because he scared people that if you go to the wrong way, you go to hell, and on taking this correct way you will be overwhelmed and you all are actually witnessing it. Like this <b>we all should increase our bhakti and growing bhakti in the work of Mahāvīr. I am happy that on this day of Mahāvīr Jayanti you all are doing Mahāvīr's work</b> ......<br />
In Sahaja Yoga we recognize Lord Mahāvīra as the Incarnation of Śhrī Bhairavnāth. He also incarnated as Imam Husayn. Saint Michael is the same who is also called Saint George [the Guardian angel of London]."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are going to do the Pūjā of Mahāvīra, and we never had this Pūjā before.</b><br />
Uh the reason for this was that Mahāvīra's life was an ascetic's life, ah just like Buddha -- even more than Buddha it would be -- uh because at the time when these two were born, the Brahminism of the Hinduism had taken a very funny form. People had become extremely ritualistic and they worsh... [were] worshiping all kinds of stones and all kinds of things instead of worshiping only the swayambhu."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are going to celebrate the birthday of Mahāvīra.<br />
Mahāvīra is the Incarnation of Bhairavanāth, or you call Him as Saint Michael.</b> Now these two Saints as you know one as the Gabriel, Hanumāna, and another is Saint Michael. One is placed on the Piṅgalā nāḍī and another one, Saint Michael, on the Iḍā nāḍī.<br />
So, Mahāvīra had to go through lots of search. Of course He was a[n] angel, but came as human being and He had to find out the thing of the left side, and how the left side acts. It's a very complicated thing, left side, is much more complicated than right side. On the left side we have also seven nāḍīs, and these seven nāḍīs are placed one after another. They are described in books and given different names to them. Now these seven nāḍīs that are on the left side, as you know, they cater to our past. Say for example, every moment becomes a past. Every present becomes a past. Then we have past of this lifetime, and also we have past of our previous lives. Then all the past is built in within us since our creation."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Śhrī Mahāvīr resides on our Iḍā nāḍī and rules it. All the saṃskāras that we have in us are corrected by Him.</b><br />
He has defined and explained what is Hell. What happens when human go to Hell and what and how they suffer in Hell, He has explained this in very detail.<br />
Buddha and Mahāvīr were samakālīn [contemporary] and both of Them had a life of penance. Both of Them were prince. But still both of Them dedicated themselves in tapasyā. And They found out that, 'When human make mistakes and go to the left side then how he goes in Hell and how he suffers.' "</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>After they get their Realization, that He called as Kevalagyān: only the knowledge, only knowledge, means Pure Knowledge.</b> They will develop some Samyak Darśhan, means Integrated Personality and all the Collective Consciousness. He talked of all, all these things.<br /> 
But as He belonged to the left side, He has described Hell very clearly. Fundamentally, basically there are Fourteen Hells according to Him. And is horrible to read all that, what He has described about Hell. Because He wanted to tell people that, 'If you do all these wrong things, you'll go to Hell.'<br /> 
And He talked about, not about Form, Formly God, but Formless God, because He didn't want people to again start ritualism but get to right ... right to the position where they could get their Self-realization to cleanse themself.<br />
So you can imagine: how difficult, in those days at Mahāvīra, was even to be one of the candidates for Self-realization. It's frightening for you! <b>That's why I never had this uh Pūjā. Because to do all these things, first of all, and to become absolutely pure, then only He would give Realization.</b>"</font><br />

It is very surprising that London which we understand as Heart has Saint George as its angel. That is! They accept Bhairavnāth so it's correct. Because if Śhivjī resides in heart then having Bhairavnāth is important.<br />
There are so many things which if we read with understanding then they are all interconnected and how is there relation automatically established.<br />
<b>In Sahaj Śhakti you get overwhelmed and you enjoy it and this makes Me happy. God has created this universe for you so you should enjoy it, what else do you want?</b> In you there are many powers and you use them and you have also shared it with others.<br />
In this way <b>the family of our Sahaj should grow. We should save as many possible, most important our children.

<font color="DarkRed">"The ascetic life of Mahāvīra was of a very, very extreme nature. He was the one who was born in a ... uh ... clan of warriors, Kṣhatriyas. And then He was also married, also He had a daughter. And then He decided, because He knew He had to do the work of the Divine, He decided to take a saṃnyāsa. So He took uh the permission of His brother because His parents were dead. He was a king, so He gave up all His uh material wealth, everything and He beg ... became a complete saṃnyāsī. And the He left His family, His left His ... house, everything behind and went alone with a little bowl for begging alms.

He was a Reincarnation of Saint Michael and He resides on the left side, on the Iḍā nāḍī. And He looks after the whole of it, right from Mūlādhāra onwards up to the Sahasrāra. <b>So Saint Michael was born as Mahāvīra, meaning The Greatest Warrior. But when He was born, the whole place got lot of uh prosperity, that's why He was called as Vardhamān, to begin with.</b><br />

And His idea is, I think that way, is to now fully go all the way to clear the left side as far as possible, to help Sahaja Yoga to establish in countries where I find still lot of this negativity is there – a lot of it.<br />
So He’s working it out, everywhere, and the psychosomatic diseases and all these diseases also, we can work it out with candle-light and all that, with three candles we can do this treatment.<br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Śhrī Rāma came on this Earth to establish the institution of benevolent king.</b> The political development and the political evolution started from this [right] side. <b>He is the one who gave leadership as a benevolent king, the one who represents God and who is a king. The idea of a king related to God came from Śhrī Rāma.</b><br />
But the modern kings are not like that, they have no relation with God. On the contrary, they are horrid people. Some of them are nothing but satanic people, absolutely Satan is there and you can see from the way they lead their lives, and they have led their life before. So the benevolence of Śhrī Rāma is here [shows the right Heart] to be followed by all the political leaders and all the people who are at the helm of affairs. He is the ideal that was created for human beings, to run their authority as the head, or the loving compassionate benevolent leader of the people, who has to govern them by making them respectful, by respect. And if human beings create such things who are not respectable, those who have no human values, those who have no moral courage, those who are selfish, those who are self-centered, then they have nothing to do to be there.<br />
<b>So this is the position of Rāma who is the Father. So the head of every state has to be the father of his subjects, that's what He has tried to show by His life.</b> So much so that He had to sacrifice His beloved Wife, whom He loved so much."</font><br />

Through the medium of Śhrī Rāma can bring change in our thoughts, he can bring change in our behavior because he is ideal for us, reaching this ideal we can reach other ideals since he is ideal of human being.<br />

Śhrī Rāma has taken the place of father hence if there is lack in the responsibility or love from father this chakra is caught. In Sahaja Yoga, we to understand that Śhrī Rāma and all other Deities have taken the form to fulfill their divine work, in all Śhrī Rāma had a special task. As it was said by Socrates that the Benevolent King has to come the same way Śhrī Rāma had come on this Earth as benevolent king, He came in the form of human being, He even forgot that He was Incarnation of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, forgot about Him but for all world, He was Puruṣhottama Rāma.<br />
In Sahaja Yoga we need to know when we pray any Deity, we have imbibed the specialties and qualities of the particular Deity within us, Śhrī Rāma had many qualities.<br />

<font color="DarkGreen">"Śhrī Rāma Himself was born on the right side.<br />
Great example for all of you is Śhrī Rām who was on the right side, who works the right side. When He was born and He was a child ...... <b>He is a Sūryavaṃśhi, He is the son of Sūrya. I mean Sūrya – everything comes from the Sun to Him.</b> When He was born and was a little child, He asked His mother that “I would like to have the Moon.” He started crying, and nobody knew how to satisfy. He said “I want to have the Moon.” They gave him any toys – he’d throw away. They said, “What a child it is, funny thing ... He wants to have the Moon, now how to get Him the moon?” They did not know how to solve the problem.<br />
He said, “Somehow you get Me the Moon. I don’t want to eat or anything, I want to have the Moon.”<br />
Here the Moon represents the Ātmā, the cooling capacity. He asked for the Moon. You are all on the right side, so ask for the Moon. Ask for the Spirit. And they didn’t know how to satisfy this Śhrī Rāma, who was the Incarnation of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, asking for the Moon of all the things, not for anything else. What is so important? So, the mother has always a[n] intuition. She brought a ... it’s a, it’s a Rāmāyaṇa, it is a beautiful drama. She brought a mirror and showed Him the Moon in the mirror. He said, “Now you can get the Moon here.” So sweet! And He was satisfied. Even the reflection of that can satisfy. You are like the mirrors and I want to see the reflection of Moon in you."</font><br />

You should be able to see this that, in this journey, nobody is your relation, nobody is your brother, nobody is your friend. You're absolutely alone, absolutely alone. You have to move alone within yourself.<br />
Don't hate anyone, don't be responsible. But in meditative mood you are alone. No one exists there, you alone. And once you enter into that Ocean, then the whole world becomes your family, the whole world is your own manifestation, all the children become your children and you treat all people with equal understanding.<br />
The whole expansion takes place when you enter inside your Spirit and see through the eyes of the Spirit. There's such calm, such peace, such bliss exists within you.<br />
You have to be ready for that journey. That journey is alone in your meditativeness. And the more you find something in your meditation the more you want to go and distribute it to others."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Now, as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned, the basic thing is Kuṇḍalinī. And <b>the Kuṇḍalinī, as I have told you, is the pure desire. Again it, listen to it carefully: pure desire.</b> That means all other desires are impure. <b>There’s only one pure desire. And that is to be one with the Divine. One with the Brahma, one with God</b>, that’s the only pure des... desire. All other desires are impure. So, train your mind gradually to achieve that desire as the main thing. If you train your mind in that fashion, then you can develop pure desire, so all other desires will negate, gradually. All right.<br />
Now, this desire to be one with the Divine is the purest and the highest. And to achieve that, what have you to do? <b>To achieve that you have to keep your Mother pleased, very simple.</b> Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya has said that “You don’t bother about anything, just keep your Mother pleased.” You have to be simple person, not try to be cunning with Me or clever with Me, I know everyone very well. Try to tell yourself that, ‘I should say things, I should behave in a manner that will please my Mother.’ Supposing you are in Sahaja Yoga and you are doing wrong things, it is not going to please Me at all. So, ‘How to please Mother,’ that you should try to see for yourself, what kind of a thing pleases Me the best. I am also a very simple person. So I want a simple-hearted person, who is simple-hearted."</font><br />

Now we have a temple in India which you have visited of Mahālakṣhmī in Kolhapur; and there, when they sing, when they worship Mahālakṣhmī at that time they say “Udho, udho, Ambe.” That time they say: <b>“O Ambe, the Kuṇḍalinī, You rise.”</b><br />
But Kuṇḍalinī is the potential of all the three powers: Mahākālī, Mahālakṣhmī, Mahāsaraswatī because it is the Primordial Desire.

It’s not only that we have risen to a very higher realm of awareness but that it has granted us so many powers that, never before in the history of spirituality people had this power of awakening of Kuṇḍalinī."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>First of all, I think this is the most important thing to understand about your own Kuṇḍalinī, as Self-realization is Self-knowledge. And the one who gives you Self-knowledge is this, your own Kuṇḍalinī</b>, because when She rises She points it out what are the problems on your chakras. Now, we say that it is pure desire, but we do not know what purity means. It means your chaste desire. It means it has no lust, greed, anything in it. That power is your own mother and is settled in your triangular bone. She’s your own mother. She knows everything about you, it’s like a tape recorder. She knows everything about you and She is absolutely the knowledge – because She’s so pure. And whatever chakras She touches, She also knows what’s wrong with that chakra – beforehand. So She’s quite prepared, and She adjusts Herself fully so that you do not get a problem by Her awakening. If any chakra is constricted, She waits and goes on slowly opening that chakra. Now, this Kuṇḍalinī is the Primordial Power which is reflected within you. And within you, in a human being it is like many strands of energy. So it’s like a rope and these energies are all twisted together to form this Kuṇḍalinī. In a human being these strands are three into seven – that is twenty-one – raised to power 108. But when your Kuṇḍalinī rises, one or two strands out of this come up and pierce the fontanel bone area – only one or two. Because it has to pass through the innermost nāḍī, known as Brahma nāḍī. It’s all a spiral throughout because Kuṇḍalinī is a spiral and these nāḍīs are also – are like a spiral like this. So the innermost nāḍī is the Brahma nāḍī. The outermost nāḍī is the right side and the second innermost is the Iḍā nāḍī."</font><br />

Additionally, they learned different meanings of the Śhakti. But one thing probably we may not know is that inside every human beings, these powers are present in a dormant state, and all these powers human beings can awaken within himself. All these powers which are present in the dormant state are endless, nor anybody can guess their limit because as an example there are 35 crores [350 million] Deities seated within you. Apart from that, there are several powers that are running them, but at least we can understand that the Self-realization that we received today, certainly <b>some Śhaktis must have worked this out.

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>In India, Navarātri falls twice in a year. Once it is in the month of Chaitra as it is today.</b> On this day Devī is worshiped as Śhailaputrī, means the daughter of Himalaya. Devī has many other names also but first of all She incarnated as Śhailaputrī in the cold of Himalayas. She incarnated and whatever She was to do. She started there.<br />
..When Kuṇḍalinī rises and reaches the Heart chakra then it manifests and becomes more powerful and effective because Kuṇḍalinī is Jagadambā. In Sahaja Yoga, when Kuṇḍalinī is awakened it, settles in Heart chakra. It protects you and takes care of you nicely.<br />
No one could harm you at all if you keep the Mother in your heart. The power of the mother always protects the children. Whenever there is some danger, it is mentioned in medical terminology that the sternum bone starts shaking and antibodies that are present all around get alarmed. In Sahaja language, these antibodies are called gaṇas. They get ready to fight it out. She is the empress of these gaṇas. They follow her commands as there is no difference between Śhrī Gaṇeśha and Devī. Both are so identified.<br />
Gaṇeśha is Her Son and She is His Mother. In Sahaja Yoga, She protects all those who have awakened Śhrī Gaṇeśha in themselves. She protects them just like Her own children at every step. She supports them because She is the Mother and you are the Gaṇeśha. But the Gaṇeśha within you should be fully awakened and pure. If there is obstruction in this chakra, it should be removed."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is new year's day and the beginning of the Moon.</b> That is why this day is given so much significance. It is known as Guḍhī Pāḍavā. A flag is put on a stick and on it is put a small pitcher. This pitcher represents Kuṇḍalinī. It is taken as a symbol. The Śhālivāhanas were the devotees of the Devī [Goddess] and it is told that they used to offer shawl to the Goddess. In the beginning they were called Sāt[a]vāhans because they worshiped Seven Plexuses and this Sāt[a]vāhana was ultimately changed into Śhālivāhana. But the symbol of Śhālivāhana is the same. They put up a ‘guḍhī’ means a flag and a small pitcher is put on it as a symbol. This pitcher has a particular shape which represents Kuṇḍalinī. So they were the worshipers of Kuṇḍalinī and followed it. That is the reason they made this symbol in this way.<br />
All those who follow Kuṇḍalinī put up a guḍhī in their houses and also put a flag on it and thus it is indicated that they welcome Kuṇḍalinī and exhibit it in a special way."</font><br />

So the establishment of the Gaurī is taken place during these nine days.<br />

In the same way our Śhālivāhans have given it so much importance that Guḍhī Pāḍavā starts on the first day of Chaitra month, because Gaurī first is Śhakti, who started the work, to start any work first we worship Gaṇeśha, this is also done by Gaurī.<br />
Gaurī has put Gaṇeśh in the temporal world or universe so that the innocence which Gaṇeśh has should spread in the whole world. And before anyone else, She established Chaitanya in the form of Gaṇeśh for the whole world and spread it everywhere. Then we will do whatever is required but first is the Spirit, the Chaitanya. The world’s Kuṇḍalinī, Mother Gaurī has done this work.<br />
The importance of this day is that this is the beginning, creating Śhrī Gaṇeśh on Her on own, no contribution from Sadāśhiv, She has not yet met Sadāśhiv, so the Virgin Gaurī, She created Gaṇapati from Her Powers, because She is Śhakti Swarūpa, She can do anything. And that Gaṇapati is pure, holy, which is in the form of Chaitanya, was made."</font><br />

When we see this love all around, it fills our heart. Exchange this love with others and talk to them sweetly. Sahaja Yogis should not be angry with anyone. Meet people very affectionately. You should be pure within and this purity of heart should be visible. There should be no anger and hatred. Only then people will appreciate you.

And that the Ocean itself is going to strengthen them and look after them. It’s the Ocean that is going to nourish them. And the same Ocean is going to guide them. So the connection between a drop and an Ocean has to be fully established. So the limitations of a drop have to be absolutely dissolved into the greatness of the Ocean.<br />
With care and with nice things to say we can improve the depth of the collectivity, and with sincere desire to be collective. The desire to be collective has to be very sincere. So, this expanse of your being will start.<br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, the great day of Holikā Dahana</b>, where the symbolism of this occasion is that the satanic forces were burnt by the innocence of Prahlāda. And that is what we have to remember, that when the Sahaja Yogis take to innocence and complete dependence on to their vibratory awareness, which is the indication of God’s Manifestation through them, they are completely protected, and even a satanic person like Holikā could not burn him [them].<br />
And this is the day today, we have to recognize that, as Sahaja Yogis, we stand no dangers in life. We are fearless people, but we are humble people, loving people, and anxious to save as many as possible. To raise the whole humanity into another awareness, in the process of your evolution, you have to achieve ghaṭ, for which you have to work hard."</font><br />

Everyone must help in every way possible to deepen and expand the experience of Divinity so that all the human race could be saved and glorified as the great children of God Almighty."</b></font><br />
<font size="+0"><b>1983-0328 Message (Holikā Dahana), New Delhi, India</b></font>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkGreen">"Śhrī Rāma incarnated before Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. He was Maryādā Puruṣhottama and as such lived a very austere life. As a result of the austerities practiced by the King Himself, the whole society turned sober and serious. The element of joy and gaiety was completely missing. In Dwāpara Yuga, when Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa incarnated, He wanted to put an end to this extreme seriousness prevalent in the society. He thought of having a festival in which everyone could laugh heartily and have fun and joy. So the festival of color Holī, was started with this purpose. People, however, took undue liberties and misused the festival to the extent of defaming it. I had also to tell that “I do not play Holī at all.”<br />
The myth behind it is that there was a demoness named Holikā. She was the sister of Hiraṇyakaśhipu, the father of Prahlāda. Since Prahlāda was the devotee of Lord Viṣhṇu, his father, the demon king, used to harass and trouble him. Hiraṇyakaśhipu wanted to kill Prahlāda. Holikā had the boon that fire won’t burn her. Hiraṇyakaśhipu asked Holikā to take the boy Prahlāda in her lap and sit on the burning pyre, thinking that she could not be burnt. But to his surprise Holikā was burnt to ashes and no harm done to the child devotee of Śhrī Viṣhṇu! It was a significant incident which proved that it is sin to be cruel, arrogant and aggressive. Despite her boon, Holikā was burnt down and no harm done to the innocent child – devotee!<br />
Such is the myth and traditionally we burn Holī every year. There lies a lot of truthfulness in all our traditions. We have to understand that misdeeds, cruelties and troubling others are evil tendencies. Right-sided people develop these devilish traits in them. We should not allow such thoughts to dominate our brains and should give no significance to them. We should love all. It is very important to understand otherwise we shall all be demonic like Holikā. Now right-sided people develop this problem. It is a big lesson for them. No harm was done to the innocent child Prahlāda. God Almighty saved him, but this demonic woman, who got a boon as a result of her severe penance was reduced to ashes. One should understand that all these demonic tendencies are destructive. We should give them up and be generous and loving towards all. Quarreling and fighting with each other are not virtues. These are demonic tendencies.<br />
We should not take to these evil traits, we are Sahaja Yogis. <b>We are special people, we have incarnated to change this world, to transform it completely. We should put our attention on that. We are very highly placed, higher than all others. We have to save this world from falling to these tendencies.</b> These are much in vogue these days. It is unworthy to say these abhorrent things and to be cruel and dominate others. It is unnecessary in Sahaja Yoga.<br />
You are powerful enough. You have such powers within you that if someone endeavors to trouble you, you will be protected like Prahlāda. No one could destroy you. You are so much protected! No such thing could destroy you."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>As you know, on the Day of Holī, Holikā was burnt.</b> Agni [God of Fire] had a very big blessing and task, because Agni Devatā had given Holikā a boon that in any circumstance, she will not burn, that death could come to her in any form, but not by fire. And after giving this boon, he regretted a lot because she took Prahlād in her lap and sat in the fire. And Agni Devatā had a big dilemma, that ``I have given this promise to her, that I will not burn her and how can I fulfill this promise? <b>And Prahlād, is Himself innocence personified, He is Himself an Incarnation of Śhrī Gaṇeśha</b> and how can I burn Him? Nobody can burn Him. And He is also beyond my powers. He is formed from my power." So he thought, ``What is this ego? that in front of such a Great Power what can I talk about my power? I have no such power which can face Him. His Power is so great that I cannot burn Him whatsoever I may try. But at this time I have a very big dilemma in front of me.""</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are here to celebrate Mahāśhivarātri.</b><br />
It’s a very great privilege for all of us to understand about Śhrī Mahādeva. Unless and until you have got your Self-realization you cannot understand what is the great personality, the character, and the Powers of Śhrī Mahādeva.<br />
Is not easy to conceive, also to reach the depth, of His greatness unless and until we are humble. We have to be very humble to reach at the Lotus Feet of Śhrī Mahādeva. As you have seen that one has to cross even the Sahasrāra to be at the Lotus Feet of this great personality. He is beyond, beyond all our conception, but He resides in our hearts as the Spirit, and is reflected very well when you get your Realization."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"I have told you about the origin before.<br />
<b>Because on the Day of Mahāśhivarātri, when there is a talk about Śhivjī, then it has to begin with origin.<br />
How much He is Primordial, means when there is a first manifestation of form of God Almighty.</b><br />
He is called as Sadāśhiva when He is enlightened from Brahma.<br />
That is why the one who is Śhivjī is called as Ādi [Primordial].<br />
You see, before the complete manifestation of any tree its seed has to be seen first and that is why it has to be called ‘Bīj Swarūpa’ – form of the seed.<br />
That is why the glory of Śhiva is very important.<br />
After that, after His manifestation, the power within Him gets Her form and is called as Ādi Śhakti."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we are going to worship Śhiva Tattwa within us, Principle of Śhiva.</b><br />
For all Sahaja Yogis it’s very important, for [as] Śhiva is the ultimate we have to achieve. Śhiva is represented in our Spirit, so to become Śhiva is the ultimate aim of everything else. The rest of it is all created, like Viṣhṇu Tattwa and Brahmadeva, just to create human beings, to evolve them, and then ultimately lead them to Śhiva. That’s the Ultimate.<br />
But human beings get so involved into the Brahmadeva’s Tattwas that even to get into Viṣhṇu Tattwa is difficult. They get into involved into the five elements which have created us. That is the outermost being within us. All the chakras have the outermost, we can say, the ... just the vessel. But the desire to be the Spirit is of primal importance in Sahaj Yog."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"We have all assembled here to worship Lord Śhiva. <b>Śhiva Pūjā is a very great and special Pūjā. The ultimate aim of human beings is to attain that Śhiva Tattwa.</b> Śhiva Tattwa is beyond the brain. It cannot be known through the brain. Till you have got your Self-realization you cannot know the Self, Ātmā or the Śhiva Tattwa.<br /> 
Too much falsehood, myth, and blind faith has taken place in the name of Lord Śhiva. Till a person is self-realized he cannot know Lord Śhiva because his nature is such that to know him, a person has first to attain that height where all the great virtues themselves enshrine within.<br /> 
...... These Śhaktis reside within us through the Śhiva Tattwa. To attain the Śhiva Tattwa Self-realization is essential. Kuṇḍalinī is the Śhakti and the chakras are the steps. One has to ascend all the steps to attain the Śhiva Tattwa. This is the revelation of all the Gods and Deities. This is their job and they are completely absorbed in it. Unlike human beings, they do not think about themselves or their rank, etc. They are a part and parcel of Lord Śhiva. To facilitate human ascent to the Śhiva Tattwa is their nature.<br /> 
They need not be lectured or told anything, they are completely submerged in their task. They work in karma. They do not think they are doing anything. They are thoughtless and unmindful for their powers, like sugar gives sweetness to food, but is unaware that it is sweet. Similarly, when Sahaja Yogis act they are not aware of the Śhakti within which is behind their actions. If the consciousness comes that I am the doer, I am a leader, etc. then you are not a Sahaja Yogi. Through Sahaja Yoga one becomes a karmi. He keeps performing without even remembering that he is doing anything. He does not even realize that he is loving though others find him very loving."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"I had told that Śhiva Pūjā means more explanation, more understanding, more this thing; because in other Pūjās we do all these mantras, this, that, but <b>in this Pūjā is to know the knowledge, it’s God.</b><br />
And to know that you know God itself is so great. Whatever it is – She may be Mahāmāyā, She may be anything, but I know Her. It cannot be described in one book, it cannot be described in hundred books.<br />
It cannot be described in words, but to know that’s God – after all, that’s God, God Almighty. And that gives you that beautiful surrender, where you just feel absolutely secured in that Ocean of Love.
I wish you all to achieve that state.<br />

Also He is the Ocean of Knowledge, so those who get self-realized get the Knowledge of the Divine, which is very subtle, permeating into every atom and molecule, the Power of this Knowledge is there. His style is such that, in his compassion, He forgives even very cruel rākṣhasas, if they dedicate themselves to Him.

Śhrī Ādi Śhakti has created all these planets, worlds, rivers and seas, humans, animals, and plants, in the eternal play of creation - only to be pleasing to You. And in complete joy, and complete detachment, You witness it all. She did all of this out of great kindness and mercy so that we, Your bhaktas, could find You again and again in the depths of our being.</b><br />
O Lord, You are the Absolute, the Fundamental Principle, the Transcendent and Unchanging Truth. You have neither beginning nor end. You are the very origin of the Self, You are both formless and omnipresent in every form. We worship You as the first syllable Auṃ. Verily You are the Creator and the Preserver. You are the Source of all knowledge. All sublime Arts and aesthetics flow from You.<br />
<b>Salutations to The Eternal Yogi, whose pale skin has the dazzling brilliance of ten million suns. You are eternally and blissfully in meditation. You reside in the snowy white peaks of Mount Kailasha, and You reside in our heart chakra; Your love sustaining each particle of creation. Verily You are the embodiment of innocence, utterly beautiful to behold.  Salutations to The Ascetic One, detached from all worldly comforts, whose radiant form is smeared with ashes. The skin of a fierce and majestic tiger adorns You. Your trident is poised to destroy all evils. And the rhythmic drum beat of Your damaru controls the beating hearts of each living soul.</b><br />
Verify You are Śhrī Neelkant whose throat has turned blue from consuming all the poisons of this entire world. You are the one who defeats the seven enemies of the soul, thus ending all worldly desires and delusions. You wear a rosary of holy Rudraksha seeds said to be made from Thine own tears of compassion. Salutations to Trilochana whose Lotus Eyes brim with love.<br />
<b>To meditate upon You is to drop into the ocean of Sachchidānanda, so that the meditating Saints and Sages of all times sing Your glories. Salutations to the One with disheveled and matted locks that billow in the mountain breezes carrying forth Thy divine fragrance; for verily You are the Lord of the Wind. You are our life breath and our lifeline. The shining crescent moon is worn as a jewel in the midnight black of Your hair, and You wear a necklace of glittering stars. From the sacred crown of Your topknot, the River Gaṅgā cascades in a joyful, purifying stream into our upturned palms as Cool Vibrations.</b><br />
We praise You as Śhrī Paśhupati, Lord and protector of animals. Your faithful servant Nandi, the bull calf, is Your Vāhana.  All creatures great and small seek Thy refuge, even those animals most feared by man. In Thy benevolence, You offer even the serpents the warmth of Your body to protect them from the icy chill of the Himalayas. Verily You are Śhrī Nnāgabhūṣhaṇa wearing a garland of snakes in three coils, representing the primordial Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
<b>We praise the One who stands on one foot, poised beyond and above the three worlds. The wise beings of all kalpas, lokas and yugas, who only exist by Your will, bow down in great thankfulness and ask for forgiveness at Your Lotus Feet. We worship Lord Naṭarāj whose cosmic Tāṇḍava Dance, in the never-ending cycle of time, eventually brings the whole universe to an end.  And we pull our ears now, we seek forgiveness for any mistakes we may make in this Pūjā. We pray that Śhrī Gaṇeśha and all the deities be present. We ask forgiveness for our attention straying from the blissful realm of spirit. And pray, please remove all ignorance, egoism, attachments, and delusions, that hinder our spiritual growth as Sahaja Yogis. Oh, Mahādeva, O Giver of Boons, please bestow auspiciousness, wisdom, and peace upon us all, may we be completely drenched by the pure joy of Bhakti.</b></font><br />
