<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we have gathered here to do the Navarātri Pūjā.</b><br />
There were nine times when the Major Incarnations of the Mother of this Universe were manifested. They were manifested with a purpose. That purpose is to protect Her bhaktas, Her disciples, Her children.<br />
This was a binding love. She could not escape it. Mother’s Love is binding. She cannot escape it. And She has to manifest it, work it out, and give that protection to all Her children.
This protection in the modern times has taken another form.<br />
In those days, the evil was trying to harm, to destroy the people who were righteous, who were bhaktas, who were doing good things, who wanted to lead a very religious life. So to save them, She incarnated.<br />
To protect them, She incarnated. But they knew what was good, they knew what was wrong. And they wanted to preserve their good life, their precious life. They didn’t care for money, they didn’t care for power, but just they wanted their life, means they wanted to be alive to worship the Goddess. And when they were troubled or harmed or destroyed by these evil forces, She had to manifest."</font><br />

So, you have a special authority with you that you can do the Pūjā of the Devī and Sākṣhāt Devī. This is not so with everyone. If everyone tries to do it, it has the reverse effect; the wrong effect.<br />
Most important thing is, this Śhakti is so comforting, so nurturing, so generous, so loving, it is so complete. There is nothing in between. Either it is very generous or very angry. Nothing in between."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>...... Navarātri is very good because these nine nights represent the main Nine Incarnations.</b> Where the Goddess took the form of Śhakti and killed the negative people. But those were easier days because negativity was understood by people and nobody sympathized. So this is what one has to understand that don't sympathize with negativity. You'll spoil them all. And always you'll find such sympathies bring forth your character also that you are also slightly negative. Because to fight negativity in modern times is a very difficult task. You cannot kill anyone: if you kill somebody, then may be that such a person is a brother or a sister or something of somebody. Or such a person would be himself or herself a seeker. So best thing is to separate like a contagious disease, keep that person out, no sympathies. And get the person cured and enjoy the life, otherwise that person is not going to be helped. It has become a very individual fight. And it's so troublesome and so disgusting. So to help Me out, you should not take any sides with negativity. That's how you can help Me the most. This is what it is the Navarātri, the Pūjā that I give you powers to fight the negativity."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>We decided to have this Pūjā of Durgā today that all negativity should be destroyed.</b> So many Deities build up the body of Kālī. Every part of Her body was created by a Deity, looked after by a Deity, and is also, later on, is reflected in you all. So they say that God has made human beings in His own image, I would say, I’ve made you in My own image, all the Deities at your disposal. They’re all with you, and they have created you – if you see it minutely – it is the Deities who have brought forth all the beauty that you had. They have made all this beautiful congregation, beautiful transformation, and they have created such angelic people out of you. They are always working it out, but one thing you have to do is to have the drive. You had pure desire to ascend, but for what? You want to have the light, but for what? You want to become gurus, for what? To save people, for their salvation. Only through your channels, I can work out Sahaja Yoga. If I could work out Myself, I would have. It’s not a question of killing one rākṣhasa. God knows how many there are, rākṣhasas and rākṣhasas. And they are everywhere, even within you they were. Now they’ve gone out.<br />
So you have to do full justice to Sahaja Yoga, that’s very important."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"You come up now to the Heart chakra. Heart chakra is divided into three parts. In the center of the Heart chakra resides Jagadambā Herself. But [in] the left side as I have told you resides Śhiva and His Power is Pārvatī. <b>When Pārvatī Herself separates Her identity with Her Lord and enters in the center to save Her children from the domination of the evil spirits, then She resides in the center and She is the Jagadambā. This is called as “Sacred Heart” in the Bible. She resides as Jagadambā. She has taken many Incarnations to save.</b><br />
Today there was Lalitā Pañchamī, they sang the song of Lalitā. The way She took Her Incarnations to fight the evil forces, to save the bhaktas from the domination of satanic and depraving personalities. She is there within you also, if not awakened She can be awakened. She is all the time there to save you from those satanic forces."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now the Durgā's qualities are that She is protective of Her children, She's very gentle, very soft with Her children, and She's extremely horrifying to the satanic people, to the negative people.</b> So in this rāga I think because there are, the notes are spaced out. So either you could play it slow or you could play it fast. Nothing in between. That's why it is on a Durgā's style. You see, either She is extremely gentle or She is extremely horrifying. So because She has a double function: is one to look after Her children, and another is protect Her children from the devils. So She has to be very quick about it, to fight them, and to, in every way to frighten them and to be alert about it.<br />
So in the second part you all became very alerted I saw. In the first part you were having a lullaby because it was the Mother's Love that was playing. The second part you became alert, because She has to fight. Now, this is such a nice rāga because it gives you a better sense of security within yourself, builds up sense of security, and also as you know medically that it's important to build up this chakra because that gives you antibodies created. So to fight all the diseases, to fight all the foreign things which try to attack us.<br />
So this rāga is so apt, absolutely apt for today's atmosphere and for today's need. That we have to have the security of the Mother and the protection of the Mother and that all the evil forces must be finished from this world, and that's how this rāga has a very great significance ......"</font><br />

And the working of that cosmos has created this Earth, and then human beings, and then the Sahaja Yogis. So, <b>Sahaja Yogis are the epitome of the creative powers, they are the epitome of God’s Desire. That’s what He desired, that’s why He created this cosmos, this universe, and this Earth</b>.<br />
So now His Desire is fulfilled when He says ... sees He being reflected through the Sahaja Yogis. But there is still a few things we have to clear out within ourselves.<br />
His Desire represents the Mahākālī Power within us. Now, we have to see how His Desire has worked in creating ourselves. First is the desire which is absolutely passionate. There’s nothing desired, nothing else is desired, but the creation of Sahaja Yogis.<br />
So, the first desire of any Sahaja Yogi is to create more Sahaja Yogis. No other desire should be dominant or exist, in a way. But to fulfill that desire, we have to fulfill some conditions."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"I would say, with this, today's special celebration of Navarātri. Like yesterday you saw Śhrī Durgā's Nine Forms, also. In that, one is <b>Kuṣhmāṇḍā, is one of the forms, that you absorb all the filth in yourself, in your stomach. But the Devī does that, not you. What the Devī can do, you should not do, that's Her job</b>, that She is supposed to do this, not you. What you have to do is to only be in silence so that you absorb whatever will increase that silence, will increase your depth. The Devī will look after all the rest of the things, she'll look after all the filth, all the anger, all the temper, all the everything that's going on in this world. She will absorb all that, but what you have to do is to just enjoy everything that is pure. Enjoyment is only possible when you are beyond your mind. With your mind you can never enjoy, it is like a big load. It will not act, it will not help. Enjoyment comes when you are in complete silence, in a rippleless lake, the reflection of all the joy that is created on the shores of that lake are completely reflected, they are not deflected, if they were repulsed it would have been a different image altogether, and would have been something nowhere near the image of reality."</font><br />

They are described, as you must have learnt on the Devī Māhātmyam – what a protections She gives you. So tremendous in Her protecting power. And this protecting power gives you understanding – how kind She is and how, I should say, how very-very protective, extremely protective. She’ll guide you all the time that you should be protected – on the left side. And through Her gaṇas She looks after you.<br />
But on the right side also. Those who are on the right side, the Goddess puts Her Powers to put you right, to bring you back to normal conditions, to humble you down and make you understand that you are a child of the Mother and you have to behave like a child."</font><br />

But that point is a star. So, you see, the Islam follows the star, the inside, and below that is this, what you call, they call it the Moon. But that's the half mudrā, or we can call it the half ......

... half of the coil. But half, according to the Western mind, half means is bad. But half is the one that takes everything within itself. You see, the one like the bottom of the sea. Bottom of the sea is always bigger than ...
......<br />
... the sea itself.<br />
......<br /> 
So this ... the Half Śhakti takes all the śhaktis into Itself. And the Bindu represents the Heart or we can say the Ātmā. So is the complete thing, is the Ādi Śhakti and the Bindu. That's the Islam seal. And in the same way this is the seal, this is the seal of the Ādi Śhakti, is a half circle. Is not even half -- we shouldn't say now first night's Moon and a star. And why this is used, because this is the thing coming from the creation, from the nature.<br />
So that also what we call Islam is nothing but is the creation of Ādi Śhakti."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>It’s a great thing today that we are celebrating the Virgin’s worship</b> in England.<br />
As you know, according to Sahaja Yoga, England is the heart where resides the Spirit of Śhiva. And that Virgin should be respected and revered, uh worshiped in England is a great honor, I think, for all the Sahaja Yogis.<br />
Now one has to think, ‘Why such an importance is paid to a Virgin? Why a Virgin is respected ... to that extent? What are the Powers of a Virgin?’ That She can bear a child of that magnitude that was Christ, that She could create Śhrī Gaṇeśha out of Her own body, that She could protect innocent, dynamic force of Her children who are egoless, who have not known what is ego.<br />
So this Great Power and Force resides in a person who has lots of puru [many, abundant] puṇyas, who has done lots of good things in previous lives, who has always understood that Virginity is a power higher than any other power and would save the Virginity and Chastity with all Her effort and care.<br />
As you know that, within our body, She is placed as Kuṇḍalinī. [It] means She is the Virgin. She is untouched. The desire to become Spirit is without any blemish: nirmala. There is no blemish. I[t]s waiting is pure. There’s no other desire, but to be one with the Divine. All other desires are finished."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is the first day of Navarātri. Today your attention should be on Śhrī Gaṇeśha.</b> His devotion is infinite.<br />
He has never worshiped anybody else except Mother. Hence He is so great. All other Gods appear very strong. Everyone has some specialty. What is Mother’s specialty? Her ego (aham) is nowhere felt by others. Hence Śhrī Gaṇeśha who has surrendered to such Mother is so wise and venerable, Mother has nothing with Her. Her very name begins with Ni, e.g., Niṣhakāñchan[ā] having no wealth, Nirlepā unaffected; Nirvichārā thoughtless; Niṣhprayojanā having no motives, Nigarvitā egoless, Niricchā desireless, etc. Therefore, surrendering to such Mother, who has nothing with Her, needs some kind of subtle thought, in that, Mother has nothing with Her, and therefore, nothing can be asked from Her. It shows how Śhrī Gaṇeśha by himself is fully satisfied. Where does this contentment of Śhrī Gaṇeśha come from? It is own power."</font><br />

She is called Satī because She entered the Holy fire of Havana and ablated Herself. But by then Lord Śhiva reached there. He lifted her burnt up body from the fire. Burnt pieces of the body of Śhailaputrī fell at many places. All these places are considered to be Śhakti Pīṭhas, the places of worship, as there is in Vindhyāchala and many other places. Her power moves there and it is said that it Sanctifies everything. Her seventh power is considered to be the Power of Destruction. Śhakti manifested Itself on the right side as Sāvitrī and Gāyatrī but the destroying force was manifested in the center. In the form of Durgā and Her other forms manifested in Heart chakra.

<font color="DarkRed">"So the ascent starts evolving. In that, the play of the Devī is the Navarātri – in your ascent – from ages. <b>Navarātri that’s why is the most important Pūjā. In Sahaja Yoga, Navarātri is the most important Pūjā, I would say.</b> Though we can say in modern Sahaja Yoga Sahasrār Day is, because that’s how you started getting your Realization. But if you go to the whole historical events of evolution you’ll find  Navarātri is the one which has brought you to Sahasrāra. Without the help of the Devī at different stages of your ascent, you could not have been in a position to receive your Realization.

<b>Sahaja Yogi:</b> Mother, today is said it's Anant Chaturdaśhī.<br />
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> <font color="DarkRed">Huh?</font><br />
<b>Sahaja Yogi:</b> Anant Chaturdaśhī.<br />
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> <font color="DarkRed">Today? Aah-ha! That's great! Yes must be. I was wondering Anant Chaturdaśhī. Anant Chaturdaśhī is the day when we visarjan, dissolve Śhrī Gaṇeśha in the water. Gaṇeśhjī ko choṛate hai na pānī meṃ [it's that day we put Gaṇeśhjī in to the water]. Because He's established for ten days. And after ten days, He's born on the fourth, after ten days He's dissolved in the water so that everywhere His Power is spread through the water.</font><br />
T<font color="DarkRed">hat's why no wonder there was a Pūjā.</font> [Laughter.]<br />
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Gaṇeśha settled down into the water. [Laughs.] That is Ananta Chaturdaśhī. Ananta is the, is Śhrī Gaṇeśha. Ananta means which cannot be destroyed. Innocence cannot be destroyed.</b> And that is why is the Gaṇeśh Chaturdaśhī, means the day when Gaṇeśha is dissolved in the water, in the ocean or He is created, worshiped for ten days and again given back. So it's a very great day today, I should say, like the Resurrection of Christ that you are, you had Christ here, He lived with you, and then went back to His Father. Father is the ocean and that's what in India they do, to establish Him on the fourth day and on the tenth day they put Him back to the ocean.</font><br />

That’s how Śhrī Gaṇeśha is so important for all the Sahaja Yogis to be understood in all its aspects, but this principle is very enormous I should say. The principle is very spread out, it’s very subtle, so to understand in all its aspects is not an easy thing. The only thing you can do is to become One with it, like the Ocean. If you become One with the Ocean you become the Ocean. Just become One with it and that’s how it works out."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So we have to first find out if the person is worthy of Pūjā or not. If the person is not worthy, it is better to leave the person alone till he becomes worthy of the Pūjā because doubts and all those things can obstruct the flow of vibrations to other people and such a person can create a problem for others. So it is not civil of that person also to be in the Pūjā if the person has not got an open heart and understanding of what Pūjā is. <b>Doing Pūjā to any Deity as such is not an easy thing, especially to Śhrī Gaṇeśha.</b> Those people who do Pūjā to Śhrī Gaṇeśha should know that of course it has to be a swayambhu means the one that is created by Mother Earth. No other than Gaṇeśha should be worshiped. And if they are not a realized Soul they can never worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha. They cannot even think of Him, they cannot even take His name, it is so difficult to reach Śhrī Gaṇeśha. <b>But after Realization, the first thing you have to do is to worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha because that’s the base on which you got your Realization.</b> He’s the One first who got His crucifixion then His Resurrection and it is the One who opened the path of Realization for you. So you have to worship Him before any other Deity with the greatest sacrifices."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Today we are celebrating here in this holy land the birthday of Shrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br />
Shrī Kṛiṣhṇa is the ultimate of the fatherhood, that I described you before, who came on this Earth and illustrated the ultimate of that. So on this Earth, the highest fatherhood is Shrī Kṛiṣhṇa’s awareness.<br />
But in the Kingdom of God, we can say in Heavens, or even above everything else, resides Sadāshiva who does not take incarnations. He is one of the aspects, Shrī Kṛiṣhṇa is one of the aspects of Sadāshiva which is the Father. And the Ādi Shakti or the Holy Ghost is the other aspect of Sadāshiva which is His power. So when Shrī Kṛiṣhṇa incarnated on this Earth, an aspect of this Ādi Shakti came on this Earth as Rādhā."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"But one has to realize that the message of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was to surrender.<br />
Now the surrendering that we think in the gross way is like an enemy surrenders to another enemy. So, when the word surrender is spoken, we build up our barriers by thinking that, 'Now, we have to surrender, leave something to the other party.'<br />
But when Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa talked about surrender, He was saying that, 'Surrender your enemies to Me so that I will get rid of them.'<br />
Now, the worst enemy that we have is our ego. And with ego starts all kinds of other problems, because it is the biggest barrier for our growth. And the ego starts, as you know, from the Viśhuddhi chakra and can be sucked into Viśhuddhi chakra away. Now let us see how this Viśhuddhi chakra made is. All the vowels that we use come from Viśhuddhi chakra."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"They had to work together many a times, and with the Principle of Viṣhṇu, the Principle of Mahālakṣhmī has acted to help the ascent of the people. So the Principle of Viṣhṇu is for your ascent, for the evolutionary process of human beings. Through this Advent and through the Power of Mahālakṣhmī, we have become human beings from amoeba stage.<br />
This is a spontaneous working for us, but for the Principle of Viṣhṇu, He had to go through various Incarnations to evolve.

<font color="DarkRed">"To overcome all kinds of nonsense of religion, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa’s Advent was there. Is a very important Advent, but I don’t know how many people understand that. He came to show that it’s all Līlā, is all the Play of God. What is there to be serious? What is there to be ritualistic? You cannot bind God in any rituals. That’s why He came on this Earth, to tell you that you should not try to bind yourself by rituals which are nonsensical. This was His teaching soo many years back, He taught this six thousand year back, but still, if you-you see, in every religion there are so many rituals going on.<br />
So when the Incarnations died, people started rituals, funny stuff."</font><br />
