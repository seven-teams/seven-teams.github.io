<font color="DarkRed">"As you know, <b>on the Day of Holī, Holikā was burnt</b>. Agni [God of Fire] had a very big blessing and task, because Agni Devatā had given Holikā a boon that in any circumstance, she will not burn, that death could come to her in any form, but not by fire. And after giving this boon, he regretted a lot because she took Prahlād in her lap and sat in the fire. And Agni Devatā had a big dilemma, that ``I have given this promise to her, that I will not burn her and how can I fulfill this promise? And Prahlād, is Himself innocence personified, He is Himself an Incarnation of Śhrī Gaṇeśha and how can I burn Him? Nobody can burn Him. And He is also beyond my powers. He is formed from my power." So he thought, ``What is this ego? that in front of such a Great Power what can I talk about my power? I have no such power which can face Him. His Power is so great that I cannot burn Him whatsoever I may try. But at this time I have a very big dilemma in front of me."<br />
So in between duty and dharma the dilemma is in between these two. In this situation we must understand that dharma is higher than duty. <b>The duty of dharma is higher than a normal duty and even higher is the Dharma of the Ātmā.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, the great day of Holikā Dahana</b>, where the symbolism of this occasion is that the satanic forces were burnt by the innocence of Prahlāda. And that is what we have to remember, that when the Sahaja Yogis take to innocence and complete dependence on to their vibratory awareness, which is the indication of God's Manifestation through them, they are completely protected, and even a satanic person like Holikā could not burn him [them].<br />
And this is the day today, we have to recognize that, as Sahaja Yogis, we stand no dangers in life. We are fearless people, but we are humble people, loving people, and anxious to save as many as possible. To eman... to raise the whole humanity into another awareness, in the process of your evolution you have to achieve ghaṭ, for which you have to work hard."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Holī was started during the time of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.</b> Before Him in the time of Śhrī Rāma ... He was very austere. Because of that the society became very peaceful but people were devoid of all joy. So He thought that there should be a way by which people should be able to laugh freely and be joyful. And like it happens to all such ventures it happened in the case of Holī also that it produced an opposite effect.<br />
......<br />
<b>The story of how it started is like this.</b> There was a demoness called Holikā. She was the sister of Prahlād and Prahlād's father used to trouble him a lot. Holikā had a boon that she would not be burnt by the fire. Prahlād's father wanted to kill him and told Holikā to take the child [Prahlād] and sit on the burning pyre thinking that she would not die. But it is surprising that she died and Prahlād was not hurt in the fire and came out of it unscathed.<br />
This is a very big happening which demonstrated that it is very wrong to be cruel and aggressive. She had the boon but still she got burnt. That's why we have this custom on Holī.<br />
In our country [India] all such things have a lot of truthfulness. We have to understand that if we do wrong things, trouble others ... then these are demonic qualities.<br />
......<br />
We should not have these demonic qualities because we are Sahaja Yogis. We are a special race of people who have taken birth to transform this world and we should pay our attention towards that. We are very highly placed, higher than all others and we have to save all others from such tendencies. These days it has spread a lot. That's why all such hateful, cruel behavior by which we dominate others, torture others is very, very bad and there is no need to do all that in Sahaja Yoga."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"So, <b>with Holī after dahan</b> [scorching], like I said yesterday, <b>let us decide today, that now Holī will be like Diwālī</b>. The joy of it should be overwhelming. Why the joy of Holī? Although we burn just one Holikā but afterwards, the joy flows in the Collective Consciousness, whether he is a sweeper or a garbage collector or even any other person working in the house. Like in My family, in Lucknow, from where My family belongs, these people are landlords. So the sweeper does not dare to enter inside the house. People don't like them coming even their threshold, to that extent. They reprimanded them.<br />
But <b>on the Day of Holī, any person, whether he is a master or a servant, anybody, they all play Holī together</b>. Even if you tear the clothes of the master then also no one will reprimand you on the Day of Holī. This is the way a social and collective celebration of happiness started in our country."</font><br />

Because on such occasions, special vibrations flow in the atmosphere.</b> When all the celestial bodies, the Eternal Personalities, Gods and Goddesses, s-s-sing the praise, and that's how the whole atmosphere is filled with mirth and happiness.<br />
Human beings also, express their gratitude. Expression of gratitude and love is done in different, different ways in different countries, but the substance remains the same and the forms change.<br />
The substance is like the ocean which flows continuously towards the shores, and the ripples which touch the shores are again repelled back, and a nice pattern is formed. It is such a spontaneous thing, and is so beautiful, creates such a beautiful pattern in the atmosphere. All these waves when they weave together the pattern of love, they soothe human beings, they enchant human beings, and the whole thing is very blissful.<br />
On such occasions a special type of feelings develop, which we cannot express in words so the expression could be in any form. But the main thing is the expression. <b>God has expressed Himself by Creation, by creating this Creation. While the Creation has to express its gratitude by glorifying Him, and this play must go on eternally. It's the most beautiful play.</b> Those who indulge into this play lead an eternal life. That life is unending, never breaks and binds the whole universe with its beautiful music. "</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Nice to see today so many Sahaja Yogis looking like beautiful lotus flowers, as the Blossom Time is filled with the fragrance of your beauty.<br />
<b>It is such a pleasure for Me to be your Mother, and to be able to communicate the Divine, the Powers of Divine, the Beauty of Divine, to you. It was never possible before, as you know. Everyone tried their level best, but nobody could achieve it, to communicate that beauty.</b><br />
As you know, Sahaja Yoga, or this Mahā Yoga, is a very unique system: it never existed before. It has come into existence, of course, I should say that because the Parabrahma decided to take a form, but you also all decided to come on this Earth to receive the blessings. It cannot be possible to do anything with one hand.<br />
The beauty of Sahaja Yoga is great, no doubt, which I'm sure, very soon people will realize. That this is the only way."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So today I am asking for two things from you. It is a funny thing that Mother has to ask for a gift.<br />
The first gift you have to give is that you should express peacefulness through your own character.</b> But it does not mean that you should be people who are timid, or people who are morbid or who tolerate nonsense. No, but the people who are peaceful resistance. You are not afraid of anything. You are not going to bow down to anything, compromise with anything, but you have that sort of a temperament you should develop and express -- is very important.<br />
<b>And the second one is that this peace and all this should express your love. Love to others.</b>"</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"We have all assembled here to worship Lord Śhiva. <b>Śhiva Pūjā is a very great and special Pūjā.<br />
The ultimate aim of human beings is to attain that Śhiva Tattwa.</b><br />
Śhiva Tattwa is beyond the brain. It cannot be known through the brain. Till you have got your Self-realization you cannot know the Self, Ātmā or the Śhiva Tattwa.<br />
Too much falsehood, myth and blind faith has taken place in the name of Lord Śhiva.<br />
Till a person is self-realized he cannot know Lord Śhiva because his nature is such that to know Him, a person has first to attain that height where all the great virtues themselves enshrine within.<br />
......<br />
These Śhaktis reside within us through the Śhiva Tattwa.<br />
To attain the Śhiva Tattwa, Self-realization is essential. Kuṇḍalinī is the Śhakti and the chakras are the steps. One has to ascend all the steps to attain the Śhiva Tattwa.<br />
This is the revelation of all the Gods and Deities. This is Their job and They are completely absorbed in it. Unlike human beings, They do not think about themselves or their rank, etc. They are a part and parcel of Lord Śhiva. To facilitate human ascent to the Śhiva Tattwa is Their nature.<br />
They need not be lectured or told anything, They are completely submerged in Their task. They work in a karma. They do not think They are doing anything. They are thoughtless and unmindful for their powers, like sugar gives sweetness to food, but is unaware that it is sweet.<br />
Similarly, when Sahaja Yogis act, they are not aware of the Śhakti within which is behind their actions. If the consciousness comes that, 'I am the doer,' 'I am a leader,' etc. then you are not a Sahaja Yogi. Through Sahaja Yoga one becomes akarmi. He keeps performing without even remembering that he is doing anything. He does not even realize that he is loving though others find him very loving.

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we are going to do Pūjā to Śhiva, Śhrī Śhiva.</b><br />
As you know, Śhrī Śhiva is the reflection of Sadāśhiva within us. I've already told about the reflection. Sadāśhiva is the God Almighty, the One who sees the play of Ādi Śhakti. But He is the Father who is watching each one of His Creation, or Her Creation.<br />
His support to Ādi Śhakti is entirely, fully, strengthening. There's no doubt in His mind about the capability of the Ādi Śhakti. But when He finds that in the play of Ādi Śhakti, the people or the world as such, try to disturb Her or spoil Her work, then He gets into His wrathful mood, and He destroys all such people, and maybe, He destroys the whole world.<br />
On one side He's wrathful, no doubt, on the other side, He is the Ocean of Compassion and Joy. That's why, when He's reflected within us, we get our Self-realization, we get the light of our Spirit, and we get into the Ocean of Joy."</font><br />

It is said about Śhrī Shivjī that He is very easy and very innocent. This is why it's very hard to know Him.<br />
<b>The work of Kuṇḍalinī is the work of Goddess. Goddess is the One who creates this universe and in the end She takes the form of Kuṇḍalinī and helps you to reach Śhrī Śhiva. When you worship Śhrī Śhiva you must remember that, `Did we have Śhrī Śhiva's qualities established within us or not?'

<font color="DarkRed">"When we worship Śhiva, we praise him. You are this you are that, you are that. When you worship Me also you praise Me, you are this. I am not aware of all that that you say. But you say all right, if you say so, it's all right. You are this you are that, the thousand names of Śhiva, thousand name of the Goddess, thousand name of Viṣhṇu. These are their names you are worshiping, what about you people, how many names you can have? Actually in the Pūjā when you take the names of these Śhaktis they also get awakened within, no doubt. After Pūjā you do feel that way but you don't utilize them. <b>So many people I've seen have come in the Pūjā and they have got that power within themselves, same powers. But by the time they are out, it's finished, it's gone.<br />
So, surrendering has another side: assumption. Assumption that I am a Sahaja Yogi and I can absorb all these powers within myself. So one side is surrendering. Why to surrender? To absorb. Automatically when you are surrendered you absorb. But once you have absorbed, then you should retain and assume within yourself, know that you have these powers.</b> There, where Sahaja Yogis fail more."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>When Śhiva closes His eyes, He is called a destroyer</b> (saṃhārak). <b>He only is the state and He only is the laya [extinction], because He can be a state, He can also be laya</b> [extinction]. I had told you about Śhiva's place in Kuṇḍalinī Śhāstra. In a man's heart, He always enlightens like the light of a lamp. Because of which the knowledge of right-wrong, discretion remains awakened, which goes on forbidding us, `Don't do this, this is wrong, this is unrighteous. This is wrong, this is deceitfulness, this is is greed, this is pride, this is jealousy, this is adharm, this is below the dignity of a man, this is not worthwhile.' But the independence that a man has, is used by him very badly and he disregards Śhiva.<br />
Śhiva drinks the poison of the whole world. Whatever amount of poison is settled in our heart, aversion towards others, evil, etc., very impure thoughts, our heart becomes poisonous, when Śhiva awakens within us, He drinks that poison. Śhiva's food, His drink is poison, whatever intoxicating things are there, the intoxicants, etc., all that is injurious to consciousness is consumed (prāśhan) by Śhiva."</font><br />

I forget everything else. I leave it in Your holy hands. You raise me up. I forget all that was in me before, just lift me up. You raise me up. Everything I have dropped out, no other desire but just lift me higher. Make me Your servant. The rest of it is not important. All the other manifestations of this desire are over. Now I am absolutely surrendered to You, my Spirit. Lift me higher and higher and higher. Away from all the thoughts and things that were not the Spirit. Make me complete Spirit.</b><br />
Forget all that was there. That elevation, that ascent becomes fast quick trip. A very fast thing. If you just try this every moment, anything that goes against the Spirit must be given up. And that Spirit is what? The pure desire.<br />
We have to be one with the Spirit, and all the rest is not important. You are in the beautiful Kingdom of God where all ugliness drops out like when the lotus opens out; all the mud drops out from it.<br />

Dear All,<br />
Today, on the Mahasamadhi Day of the complete Incarnation of Śhrī Ādi Śhakti Śhrī Mātājī Nirmalā Devī, with folded hands and bended knĪs and in complete love and awe and gratitude, we remember the Earthly life of our Divine Mother and all She has done for the evolution, redemption, and spiritual uplifting of mankind.<br />
<br />
It is a time to re-commit and re-dedicate ourselves to Her Visions expressed in Her teachings, to the work of Sahaja Yoga, and to the advancement of Vishwa Nirmala Dharma and of Sahaja Culture.  We pray to Śhrī Mātājī to help us to accomplish all Her Divine Visions. 
With all these in mind, we propose to watch the documentary"Vision"<br />

She has so many qualities as I told you which cannot be described in one lecture. But one of the greatest quality of Hers is: that She ends up into subtler things.<br />

<font color="DarkRed">"And as love will increase, your creativity will develop. So the basis of all creativity of Saraswatī is Love. If there is no love there's no creativity.<br />
It's even in the deeper sense, if you see, people who have created all the scientific things are also out of love to the masses, not for themselves. Nobody has produced anything for themselves. If they make something for themselves, it has to become for universal use, otherwise it has no meaning.<br />
......<br />
<b>So, all the activity on right-hand side of Saraswatī, basically has to end up in love: starts with love and ends up in love. Whichever does not end up in love, coils up and finishes off. It just disappears. So you can see that even matter which is not used for love just finishes off. The basis has to be love.</b>"</font><br />

They wrote only what they understood, but now that you are realized you can understand that by the Power of Śhrī Gaṇeśha's name you can get your Realization. By taking His name alone any disease or any pain will disappear. He is eternal. He is always present within us, when you get your Realization, you can feel Him. "</font><br />

<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Today is a very important day for all of us, Sahaja Yogis, because today Śhrī Gaṇeśha was born.</b><br />
Śhrī Gaṇeśha is whom we worship and because of whom we got our Realization. However much you may remember Him, until you do not know His special qualities, you cannot attain Him. His special quality is that He is the Embodiment of Purity (Śhuddha Swarūp) and Complete Master of the Universe. He is the Incarnation of the Supreme, of Brahman.<br />
By coming into this world He has created music (saṅgīt), rhythm (tāl) and notes (sur). By His Grace only people become one with music (tallīn) [engrossed]. A small boy who came into the world and did such great work! He has given so many things to everyone and even today He is active.<br />
<b>Śhrī Gaṇeśha's Pūjā, no matter how much you do it, it is not enough.</b><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Śhrī Gaṇeśha was made out of the, they say, it is a beautiful poetic way of saying it, out of the mud that was covering the Mother Pārvatī</b> or you can say the Gaurī at that time. Because She was not married in the sense that She was a virgin, just finished her marriage and She was to meet Her husband and this virgin wanted to have a bath before meeting her husband, so she cleanses her hands properly and makes this Deity of Śhrī Gaṇeśha which is bestowed on this center. If you really develop your proper insight through meditation you can see Śhrī Gaṇeśha settled down there very clearly.<br />
<b>Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the Embodiment of Innocence</b> and that's why He is a child, that's why His head is that of an elephant, because an elephant being an animal doesn't grow into ego and superego like human beings do. That's why He is a child. <b>He is the Embodiment of Childhood</b> and He incarnated on this Earth once which is described in Devī Bhāgavat[am] if you read as Mahāviṣhṇu."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkGreen">"But when Pārvatī made Śhrī Gaṇeśha, He was the Son of Pārvatī alone. There was no Father. Pārvatī Herself wanted to have a child of Her own. There were angels who were dedicated either to Viṣhṇu or to Śhiva, like gaṇas were dedicated to Śhiva alone. So, She wanted to have Her own Son who can permeate Her Powers on this Earth.<br />
So to begin with when the Śhakti created this universe and Sadāśhiva was watching Her creation, the first thing She created on this Earth was innocence and the Embodiment of that Innocence was Śhrī Gaṇeśha.<br />
The whole Universe was covered with innocence, which we call as Oṃkāra. This innocence protected all the creation of the world and penetrated into all that is matter."</font><br />

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"I have said a lot about Śhrī Gaṇeśha and His importance in our life.<br />
He is the giver of wisdom. But this wisbom ... wisdom comes from our innocence, innocence that is innate within us. As children, we are innocent, but as we grow we start exerting ourselves in a manner that we start losing our innocence.<br />
We lose it in two ways. Once we have lost our innocence, we cannot believe that others could be innocent. Another is that we think innocence is not important.<br />
Innocence is the sustainance [sustenance], is the basis of spirituality. If a person doesn't have innocence, we [he] cannot rise in spirituality.<br />
<b>That's why the first job of Sahaja Yoga is to establish Śhrī Gaṇeśha within you, to awaken Him. As soon as the Kuṇḍalinī awakens, you must know that Śhrī Gaṇeśha comes into being. Without His awakening within you, Kuṇḍalinī cannot be raised.</b>"</font><br />

I would say that all of you have become realized and vibrations are flowing through you. Now you should make use of these vibrations, establish the śhakti within you, establish the peace within you and show the world that this power is within us and we have to acquire it. We have to nurture this, improve this with your good qualities and truthful speech.<br />

The Sun gives it the energy, and the Creative Power of the Paramachaitanya, its aspect of action, has got activated through Sahaja Yoga. Till now Paramachaitanya was not successful in any task. The reason was, that the Sun had not yet appeared in its courtyard. But now this Sun has risen in the courtyard of Paramachaitanya. And because of that you all have the light of it within you. Because of that light, your Kuṇḍalinī has awakened, and within you, the field of creation has fully blossomed. And this field of creation you all are developing, in a way that the whole world can benefit from it. And it's a very great and divine thing. This could not take place earlier. <b>In our country many Sages have expressed many ideas about, that such a day will come, when collectively this creation will get awakened.</b><br />
That creation has awakened now. And that's why this is not only an occasion for Earth's creation but a great occasion for Sahaja Yoga's creation also. This year specially is considered to be a very important year for Sahaja Yoga, and the light of Sahaja Yoga will establish very deeply in the people. When something starts to establish deeply, then we must understand that along with it, some other important events also take place."</font><br />

Sahaja Yoga is not limited with you. It's not meant for one individual, not at all for one person but for the whole world. We have Sahaja Yogis all over the world, but they don't spread Sahaja Yoga. They are satisfied with their own motives. This is not Sahaja Yoga. You must openly talk about and say about it. But Sahaja Yogis are very shy, they don't talk about Sahaja Yoga.

The Sun changes its direction, everybody knows about it, everybody prays for it.<br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, again, is a New Year's Day.<br />
Uh every new year comes because we have to take to something that is new. It has been so arranged that the Sun has to move for three hundred and sixty-five [365] days and again a new year has to come.</b><br />
Actually the whole solar system is moving in a spiral way. So, there is definitely a higher, higher state, of this solar system. Every year it is rising higher in a spiral way. So it is not only that: it is because three hundred and sixty-five [365] days have passed because it has moved a step forward, higher than whuh ... what it was.<br />
Now, we can see that in awareness, human beings have definitely risen much higher than what they were, say, about two thousand years back.<br />
But the first system that started, the whole universe was the first model, one can say, was created. And that model has to be perfect. And that was a perfect model, which then started perfecting the rest of it. So that is the perfect model which is in the Principle of this Ascent, and that is working out this ascent.<br />
Now, the perfection of the rest of the universe takes place in various directions. But today we have to consider the Mahālakṣhmī Principle.<br />
Now Mahālakṣhmī, as I told you, is a perfect principle. Is a perfect principle, it's perfect in it. It's born as perfect, will remain as perfect, will be always eternally perfect. So, that is not necessary to be corrected."</font><br />

Sometimes you might feel you are let down, sometimes you'll feel, "Oh, this should have happened." Do not desire for anything! Whatever is your desire is not correct, that's all. If the desire is correct and is deserving, it will happen -- hundred per cent [guaranteed]!<br />
So all the best, and the greatest year, and happiness and joy.<br />

<font color="DarkRed">"So today is a day of a new year and we should think why do we have new years -- what is the need to have a new year? We want something new that you start something afresh to ourselves, to others, to your Mother, to your Guru. That you have to get out of the clutches of ignorance and darkness. That you have to get out of the bondages of ego. That you have to become absolutely a free glorious personality. And that you have to fight the superego influences and all the bad conditionings should be thrown as torn clothes and should wear new beautiful clothes of Sahaja Yogis.<br />
Let all the people, let all the Sahaja Yogis raise their voices from the top of their houses and top of their mountains, the top of their higher positions. Broadcast to the whole world, inform the whole people that you have found the Truth and everybody has to find the Truth, otherwise there is no escape. That you have found the joy and that everyone has to find it and everybody must work to get to it."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we are going to worship Mahālakṣhmī Principle within us.</b><br />
As you know very well that Mahālakṣhmī Principle resides in the central path of our being, through which Kuṇḍalinī has to rise. But Kuṇḍalinī enters into our body through the left side. In the sense that is the residual power of creating everything, left side, right side, and then She enters into our sacrum bone.<br />
So, in the Mahālakṣhmī temple, in Kolhapur, they sing a song of Kuṇḍalinī Ambe that, "Oh Ambā, please rise," "Kuṇḍalinī, please rise." In the Mahālakṣhmī temple they have to do it because through Mahālakṣhmī channel only She rises.<br />
Now the Mahālakṣhmī Principle within us starts manifesting when our Lakṣhmī Principle is complete. Mahālakṣhmī Principle is to ascend above all material seekings."</font><br />

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"So today the <b>first and the foremost vow is</b>, as I told you, that we have to get cleansed up in such a way that we become free of ego and superego. We should get rid of our ignorance and darkness. <b>And the second vow as I have said</b> that you have to become the light to remove the darkness and ignorance of others. By sharing My problems, by sharing My anxieties about them -- those who are lost -- and not to be involved into your own personal anxieties and petty things. My problems should be your problems now because you all belong to Me, to My body, to My being.<br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>This Mahālakṣhmī Principle when manifests in your Sahasrāra, then there are no words that one can express how it brings a divine light in you.</b> You know you are knowing the Truth, you know it very well. You know what is reality. You are so knowledgeable. Still you don't look down upon people who are ignorant. So in Sahasrāra it manifests compassion, tremendous compassion. Now one may say how can brain have compassion? But the Kuṇḍalinī comes out of the Heart center. That Heart center enlightens your heart and the first thing that shows in you is the feeling of tremendous compassion. You don't worry about yourself, you do not think about yourself, you all the time you are thinking about others' Realization. And as soon as you start paying attention to that, that person gets all right. You are on solid grounds and you are so confident but at the same time we are extremely humble, kind and gentle."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we are celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ.</b><br />
The birth of Jesus Christ is very symbolic, because He was born in such a manner that even the poorest of poor won't be bornt [born] in the stable. And He was put in the bed which was made of dried grass.<br />
He came on this Earth to show people that for a person who is an Incarnation or who is a highly evolved soul, is not bothered about the comfort of the body. His Message was so great and so deep, but He had disciples who were not prepared for the battle they had to fight. Is the same thing that sometimes happens with Sahaja Yoga. He had only 12 disciples, we too have 12 types of Sahaja Yogis, and all of them, though [they] try to dedicate themselves to Christ, fell a trap, some of them, to the worldly aspirations or to their own hankerings.<br />
<b>His Message of Love and Forgiveness is the same even today. Preached by all, all the Saints, all the Incarnations, all the Prophets. They all have said about Love and Forgiveness.</b>"</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"The reason for celebrating this auspicious day is the birth of the Christ. Very little is known about Jesus Christ because in young age he left his house and after returning he lived only up to the age of thirty year. But during this short period he did tremendous work.<br />
......<br />
<b>So He told two things, the first is to "forgive everyone." Knowingly or unknowingly if someone troubles you, you should forgive him.</b> You will not get tortured but if you do not forgive then you torture yourself because another person is sitting nicely. So you must develop the habit of forgiveness.<br />
<b>Second thing that He told us is that, "You are the Spirit." Know this Spirit, the Self. No one can touch the Spirit, can destroy it, no one can torture it.</b> If you are that Spirit then you should be established in it. But to achieve this Ātmā Tattwa the awakening of Kuṇḍalinī is necessary. First is to work out the awakening of the Kuṇḍalinī and then to get established in it. Until you are established, you will remain entangled in stupidities. So one should know how to be established within, to remain within thyself."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"The aim of Jesus Christ was to open the center of your Āgñyā and to achieve that purpose He got Himself crucified and then He resurrected. It appears to be a miracle but for the Divinity there is no miracle as such. He proved that human beings could rise above the center of Āgñyā and on this center <b>He told two mantras which we call Bīj Mantras: Ham and Kṣham. Kṣham means to forgive. Kṣham is the biggest mantra. The ego of the person who knows how to forgive, gets destroyed</b>.<br />
One is proud of small-small things. For example, if you tell someone to sit on the earth, his ego gets hurt. If someone is told to sit in the chair, he will reply, 'This chair is very small, why have you given it to me?' Everyone has some expectation about him and if his expectations are not fulfilled, his ego immediately comes up. Unknowingly, sometimes such things could be done but the egoistical people take it as their insult.<br />
Such people make their condition very miserable. All the time they think they are being insulted and humiliated. He is always obsessed with this thought and he draws negative meaning of whatever is told to him.<br />
So we have to think of what Jesus Christ had thought. He said, "Forgive those who have trespassed against you."<br />
Now see the results if you forgive everyone. You will neither suffer nor get disturbed mentally. You will not think of the person whom you have forgiven. Nothing could go against you because you forgive everyone.<br /> 
We get this power from the center of Āgñyā. The person whose Āgñyā is clear forgives everyone. If we do not forgive we torture ourselves and play in the hands of others, who assume power over us. Forgiveness is the greatest message that Jesus Christ has given to mankind.<br />
<b>Second is Ham, it has altogether different meaning. Ham means 'To know thyself'. You have to know that you are the Spirit. You are not this body, mind, brain or ego. You are the Spirit. When you know this Ham then it will be clear to you that you are the Ātmā.</b> The Spirit means that all the ego, foolishness, ignorance that we have in our mind, are meaningless. All these negativities have absolutely no place in the pure Spirit. You are very pure."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"It is said in Marathi that: "Forgiveness is the decoration of a vīra." Vīra is the brave. Only the brave could forgive.<br />
Now, how many of us really know how to forgive others [laughing:] and to love others?<br />
So many write that, "Mother, my heart is like a stone." So now you jump in the sea! What are you doing here? Stones must go to the sea. Or they say, "My heart is not open." I say, "Why do you write like this?" "Because I'm very, very frank and honest." With whom are you honest? For such people there is no Sahaj Yog. They should really leave Sahaja Yoga and go away.<br />
Sahaja Yoga is meant for people who have a very large heart where [laughing:] Christ could be adorned. He's to be restored upon that great heart of yours. In every way one has to enlarge the heart.<br />
That's why I think William Blake very clearly said that, "England should be the Jerusalem." But only by saying that, 'William Blake said so,' one should know that it's complete [darkness], complete [darkness]. He is hoping against hopes. Large heartedness is missing among the people who live on the heart.<br />
As you know about the French, they call themselves Christians. Italians, who have so-called Christianity, have the worst pictures; so licentious, so horrible, so much against Christ. It's very surprising. How we can do such things to bring bad name to Him and to the whole world where you represent Him?<br />
People think Christianity means licentiousness, permissiveness, drunkenness, abandonment of all the values, while Christ was just the opposite of.<br />
Absolutely, He did not need any values. He was guṇātīt. He is dharmātīt, everything. But how He lived on this Earth, such an ideal!<br />
So before us we have got a great ideal. We don't have to follow the ideals of these horrible kings who lived there. But we have to follow the ideal of Christ and those kings who followed the ideal of Christ. Because if you are following Him, the path that you are following has to be, the essence of Christ's life is a pure life of love and sacrifice. This is what one has to follow.<br />
Throughout His life, He has been using this essence just to establish Himself in our Āgñyā chakra and that's what He's worked very, very hard to do that. Let us not do anything to let Him down in our character."</font><br />

I wish peace for the whole world, for the whole nation, to understand to give up all the strives, all the false battles, for money and for power, all wrong ideas that they are different from each other, and come under the banner of Sahaja Yoga and enter into the Kingdom of God, where they are invited with all respect and love.<br />
I wish peace to all of them, to all the countries, all the human beings: in their families, in their hearts, with their children, with all of them. Let there be peace, let their heart emit peace, their tongues speak with peace, their eyes see nothing but peace.<br />
All this has to change, tremendous change has to take place. ......<br />
