<font color="DarkRed">"Gaṇeśh is the first Deity that got established and similarly the situation of Gaṇeśh is same as that of Mahākālī. This is the seed and the whole world emanates from this seed and again gets merged with it. Similarly, everything after emanating from the Gaṇeśh Tattwa merges with Gaṇeśh Tattwa itself. Whatever exists, Gaṇeśh is the seed of that. Whatever appears in front of us, in action, in desire, Gaṇeśh is the seed of it. That is why Gaṇeśh is considered the foremost main Deity.<br />
Not only that, without worshipping Śhrī Gaṇeśh, we cannot do any work. Then they may be Śhaiva [Śhaivites], may be Vaiṣhṇav, may be devotees of Śhrī Brahma or anybody else, all of them first worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha. The reason for this is that Śhrī Gaṇeśh Tattwa was established by God Almighty as the first thing in this Universe.<br />
The Gaṇeśh Principle is what we call as abodhita [ignorant of wrong behavior] or what we call as innocence in English. This is a very subtle principle. We do not understand it. In childhood it exists in the children, everywhere we see its expression, its fragrance, wafting all over -- that is why small children are so lovable -- such is the Principle of Innocence. It is present in Śhrī Gaṇeśha."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Today, we are going to worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha.<br />
As you know, in the whole of Europe, America, England, they have lost faith in Śhrī Gaṇeśha. Nor do they care for His Powers and for His blessings. As result, all His blessings are not on these countries.<br />
<b>The first blessing of Śhrī Gaṇeśha, which is, I think is the highest, is the wisdom</b>, that we learn what is good for us and what is bad for us, what is constructive and what is destructive, what should we do to achieve our Self-realization. Those people who have got wisdom are very lucky people.<br />
But wisdom comes from no source but your own understanding of life."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the Deity of Innocence.</b><br />
When we are born as children, it is Śhrī Gaṇeśha who is acting and we are very innocent, and it is such a powerful thing that, with this innocence, children survive under many circumstances. And we love them, because they are innocent. We enjoy them, because they are innocent.<br />
Once we start growing, our Sahasrāra also gets closed and we develop all kinds of funny things that enters into us and doesn't go out. It's just there, it doesn't go out.<br />
Innocence has a great effect on our character and on our sense of chastity. Actually, when you are innocent, you don't know what is not chastity, what is being unchaste, what is being cunning. You are innocent and you are looked after by Śhrī Gaṇeśha Himself."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Today, we have gathered here to worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha.<br />
<b>You all know what a powerful Deity He is. His Power comes from His innocence.</b><br />
When we see small children, we [are] automatically compelled towards them and also we want to love them, kiss them and be with us [them]. And very innocent they are, extremely innocent.<br />
And when we worship Śhrī Gaṇeśh we have to know if we have been really innocent or not."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Innocence is the sustainance [sustenance], is the basis of spirituality. If a person doesn't have innocence, we [he] cannot rise in spirituality.<br />
That's why the first job of Sahaja Yoga is to establish Śhrī Gaṇeśha within you, to awaken Him. As soon as the Kuṇḍalinī awakens, you must know that Śhrī Gaṇeśha comes into being. Without His awakening within you, Kuṇḍalinī cannot be raised. But it could be temporary, or it could be a permanent thing.<br />
It could be very temporary with people who are not yet adjusted to the new method or to the Ways of God's Love. Those who have not understood, or those who have not gone through those traditions, is rather difficult for them to establish Śhrī Gaṇeśha within them. "</font><br />

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the first Deity that was created so that the whole Universe is filled with auspiciousness, with peace, bliss, and spirituality. He is the Source. He's the Source of Spirituality. As a result of that all other things follow. Like when it rains and is windy you feel a coolness in the atmosphere. In the same way when Śhrī Gaṇeśha emits His Power we feel all these three things within and without. But it has been so unfortunate, specially in the West, that the most important fundamental Deity has been completely not only neglected, but insulted and crucified.<br />
So today though I did not want to say anything to upset you people, but I must tell you that worshiping Śhrī Gaṇeśha means there has to be a thorough cleansing within you. When you worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha keep your mind clean, keep your heart clean, keep your being clean -- no thoughts of lust and greed should come up. Actually when the Kuṇḍalinī rises Gaṇeśha had to be awakened within us, the innocence has to come up -- which obliterates all such degrading ideas within us. If ascent has to be achieved, we have to understand that we have to mature."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Now look at Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa as a child: how innocent He was, and how powerful! He wanted to eat the butter. Now why He wanted to eat the butter because all the butter that was made in Gokul, in that place, was sent to Mathura where this horrible King Kaṃsa was ruling. And all his military people became very strong by eating that butter. So He didn't want them to eat the butter, so He started a kind of a tribe of small children and a game that they climb on top of each other. And the butter was kept in a pot hanging from the roof, so they would go and eat all that up. In that little childhood He started this innocent play, so all the children used to climb up and eat the butter. So now there's no butter left, so how will they take it to Mathura? This was done and one day His mother caught hold of Him.<br />
She said, "Did You eat any butter from here?" All butter was here all around. He said, "How? How can I eat the butter? See, can I reach My hand there? See now, how can I ..." "Oh, so You took the stick and broke it?" "No, no, I did not." "Then what is all this?" "See, these are all My friends who ate it. I put it on My mouth so that you can beat Me." So innocently talking like an ordinary child, this One, an ordinary, simple child. So Mother said, "All right. Let Me see Your mouth."<br />
He opens the mouth and She sees the complete, She sees the complete universe, complete universe revolving into His mouth.<br />
And She sees it. And She says, "Oh Lord, please forgive Me. I forgot! I really forgot that You are the Lord of this universe and I am doubting You!" She just fell at His feet. "There must be some play in what You're doing." In a simple, innocent way like a child would say He told the Mother.<br />
So the innocence of a child and the innocence of a virgin, or you can say the chastity of a virgin and innocence of a child brought forth, brought forth the existence of America."</font><br />

We have to understand clearly that Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa is a very-very important Deity within us. Because He is the Viṣhṇu, who resides in the Void, in the Nābhī. He is the One who generates dharma within us.<br />
When you got your Realization I didn't tell you, 'Don't do this,' 'Don't do that.' I never told you that, 'This is not good, 'That is not good.' You just did it, because Śhrī Viṣhṇu was awakened within you.<br />
He is in the Void, and if He is awakened, He brings you to the light: removes your ignorance, removes your darkness, and you start seeing that whatever you were doing was destructive for you. And that's how the dharma is established. Of course, the dharma was established also by all the Ten's Gurus who came on this Earth, the Prophets, who taught us about dharma."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So Kṛiṣhṇa was a[n] Incarnation of Diplomacy, I must say, Divine Diplomacy, because He knew about the human brain, and He knew how to put it forward.</b> So He said, "All right, you do all your karmas, and put it at the Lotus Feet of the Lord," which cannot be, it's not possible. We may mentally think, "Oh, I'm doing all for God's sake I'm doing this." That's just our imagination. But you just don't do it, because the karma has to become akarma, means 'non-action' -- that's only possible when you get your Self-realization. When a self-realized Soul gives you Kuṇḍalinī, he doesn't say -- raises your Kuṇḍalinī, doesn't say, 'I do it.' He says, "It's rising, it's going, it's working out." In the third person he talks, so the whole thing becomes akarma.<br />
Then He says that, "Whatever are the flowers and things like that you give Me," that's the Bhakti Yoga, "I'll take it." But He uses only one word on which He has made everybody dance, and that word is ananya -- <b>Ananya Bhakti: "When there is not the other, when you are united with Me."</b> "</font><br />

<font color="blue">"So this Viśhuddhi on the right-hand side is to be controlled by surrendering as it is said, actually you surrender your ego to begin with. And this ego when you surrender, it has to be done from you heart, it should not be a lip service. From your heart: "I don't want this ego any more, I want reality. Let the reality be seen by me, felt by me, enjoyed by me." And once you start doing it from your heart you'll be amazed that your voice will become sweet. Apart from that it will have the Divine Power flowing through it. That is what we say that you have now got Vāk Śhakti, means 'the Power of Speech'.<br />
So when you surrender ego, what do you do actually is to say that, "I'm not doing anything, it is You who do everything." So that a little drop has now become an Ocean. And so, your sound has got the Power of the Ocean."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"So the main Principle of Kṛiṣhṇa was collectivity -- Rāsa -- everybody one with the energy; energy circulates through everyone, and just the opposite that the country developed into individualism and everything was to create something that collective was not. Individualism, when it is not connected to the mains, is destruction. Like all these trees you see, they are individuals as you see them separate, but inside they are fed by the same Mother [Earth]. They have the same sap running in them. When this connection is broken, then all this individualism is nothing but destruction and that's how in America the connection with the collectivity was broken by every sort of funny methods that one cannot conceive how human beings can go to that level."</font><br />

Today is the Full Moon Day, and this day what we do is to tie a band of threads around the person whom you want to protect. But it is done between brothers and sisters.</b> The sisters tie this bondage to the wrist of the brothers, and when they do that, they are putting all their love around the wrist, that it is the day for giving all their love, everything to their brother, as a protection, as a symbol of their protection through that thread. Is a very, very simple thread they use. And uh this is, has to be tied on the left-hand side. But people tie it on the right-hand side, which is a mistake.

So now here we are celebrating actually the Deity which is the Sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br />
Later on She was born as Draupadī. And that's why Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa went to save Her chastity, because is the brother only who is concerned about the chastity and the name of the sister."</font><br />

O Divine Mother, You are verily the One who gives chastity, the Foundation of all dharmas.<br />
Salutations to You!<br />
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now Viṣhṇumāyā's Power is very important to understand, because Mother Power is to protect your innocence, because that is the most important thing. To protect your innocence is the Mother's Power.</b> Now, Viṣhṇumāyā's Power is to protect your chastity. You don't understand sometimes what is chastity and what is innocence. Innocence is a power which is not acted upon. Like we have electricity in our house, the electricity exists like innocence exists within us; but enactment of that is done through chastity. A person can say, 'I did this very innocently' -- no, he cannot. Because whatever you do if it is innocent, cannot be harmful to your character, to your innocence or to your righteousness.<br />
So those people who say like this, that, 'I did it innocently,' are wrong, because innocently if you do anything it becomes chastity. So when innocence is practiced it becomes chastity. You must have respect of your chastity. <b>Chastity is the one which is Viṣhṇumāyā's Power within us, Gaurī's Power, is the pure virgin.</b><br />
......<br />
Now to understand the significance of chastity within us, we have to know that <b>chastity is the foundation of all dharmas</b>. Unless and until you have sense of chastity you cannot have dharma. Dharma is not possible because that's the foundation. It will be a house of cards; if you do not have the foundation of chastity it will just collapse in no time."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now our Viṣhṇumāyā Principle is to be always kept very alert because it helps us in many ways.</b> First of all it helps us to pass the messages from your heart to your head. It is the one by which we integrate. Our heart and head is integrated by the Viṣhṇumāyā Principle more than the Viśhuddhi on the right side.<br />
Viśhuddhi on the right side can create collectivity, can create understanding with each other but on the left side it helps you to keep a complete integration between your heart and your head.<br />
If there is a guilt you just think of it and analyze it. It means that there's a struggle between you in your heart and your mind, isn't it? Simple as that. If it was integrated you would not feel guilty. And that is why all these artificial theories that have come, all these artificial yarns that you have read and all that, you forget it.<br />
<b>You are a Sahaja Yogi and you have entered into the Kingdom of God -- enjoy! That's all you have to do. But you have to get to that state of enjoyment and understanding that you are above all.</b>"</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So now here Viṣhṇumāyā is the One who is the virgin. Not only that She is a virgin, but She exist[s] in all the five elements, as shown that She [Śhrī Draupadī] married five Pāṇḍavas. And that, this power of virginity in Her, used to expose people to the dangers of these horrible Kauravas who were going to rule and destroy the dharma. See, so She stood back. And She is the one who said that, "You have to fight. You have to fight for dharma, whatever may happen."<br />
And Kṛiṣhṇa always supported Her. So, as a brother, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa supported Her.<br />
So the relationship between brother and sister are very important, in India. Also should be with Sahaja Yogis, because we have Rākhī Bandhan. You also have what you call the Bhāī Dūj, where on Diwālī Day we tie up a rākhī to the brother.<br />
<b>Now this rākhī is nothing but the Viṣhṇumāyā's Power, which protects the brother. Actually, there the brother [Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa] protected Her, and now the sister's love protects the brother.<br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So, this day is uh extremely important, in a way, for Sahaja Yogis to observe, and I'm happy that I am here, because it's very important also for America.</b><br />
Uh as I told you that, I have already talked to you how the-ee war between Alexander and Puru's was finished because of a sister's intervention.<br />
And, also, how Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, whose sister was Draupadī, Viṣhṇumāyā was born as Draupadī, and how He came to save Her chastity, by rushing all the way from Dvārika.<br /> 
So, we can see that when we ascend in the Collective Consciousness and we have collective living, collective meeting, at the Viśhuddhi chakra, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa establish[ed] this, or He manifested uh this pure relationship of a sister.<br />
In a collective life that we have, in the Āśhram where we live, where we move about as Sahaja Yogis, if we do not have this basic principle within us, there will be a chaos, complete chaos.

<font color="DarkRed">Many blessings,<br />
Received your rākhīs conveying your deep love. Rākhī is Protecting Power. Its bond is very strong and extremely tender because it symbolizes the noble love of sister. Customarily, <b>tying a rākhī to someone is establishing a place of Pure Protection</b>. However, man's ability to understand love has become so feeble that tying of rākhī has become merely a mechanical process. All beautiful human traditions become lifeless and dry formalities if there is no warmth of faith in them.<br />
......<br />
<b>Rākhī Pūrṇimā is a day of great significance. On that day you should ask for perfection, make big decisions and keep attention on high ideals.</b> Sahaja Yogis should not destroy their attention on trifle issues. Lot of work has yet to be done. Those Sahaja Yogis who have progressed should get busy. New centers should be opened. People should be cured of their diseases and their attention should be drawn towards God-realization.<br />
Please show this letter to all Sahaja Yogis.<br />
Always remembering you<br />
<b>-- Your Mother Nirmalā</b></font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is a day peoples ... this is created by human beings and not by God, as Guru Pūrṇimā. Because as God has created days of Their advent, human beings have created days of their surrendering.</b> So this is the day when you have to give something to the Guru, and Guru does not have to give anything to you. This is the time you have to say: `What you are going to give? What you are going to do for your Guru?' Because so far the Guru has been giving.<br />
If you are in meditation, supposing you say, `We'll meditate because Guru Pūrṇimā is there,' that's not the way the Guru Pūrṇimā is to be celebrated. Because if you meditate, you are taking from Me. If you try to correct yourself, you are taking from Me. If you are going to get cured, you are taking from Me.<br />
So now what can you do for Me? Is the point, you have to think about it. `What can you do?'<br />
Now I have sent the same question to India, to find ... I asked them to find out: `What can you do for Me?'<br />
You will say: `Mother, what can we do? After all, what are we?' That's a way of evading the issue.<br />
But if you really want to see, <b>you can do a lot. And that is what it is that: you are My witness. You are My publicity!</b><br />
So, today you have to take some vows. And you have to say: that, `We are going to do these things. We are going to talk about Sahaj Yog, we are going to propagate it, we are going to spread it. And what may come, we are going to surrender ourselves to Mother. Even, if She's supposing, scolds us, or says anything it is for our good. And we are not going to get confused.' And that's how you have to <b>absolutely vow that you are going to dedicate yourself to Sahaj Yog to help others, to e... emancipate, and to create atmosphere for the completion of this universe, of this creation, for that fruitful day when we will say: that the Kingdom of God has been brought on this Earth.<br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is the day of Guru Pūrṇimā. It is a Full Moon Day. That's why ... it is called as Pūrṇimā. The guru has to be like a Full Moon. Means completely grown, completely matured.</b><br />
There are sixteen kalās or the phases of the Moon, and when the complete Pūrṇimā comes in, the Full Moon Day, all the sixteen kalās are completed. You also know that in the Viśhuddhi chakra there are sixteen sub-plexuses. When Kṛiṣhṇa is described as Virāṭa, He's called as the Sampūrṇa, the Complete Incarnation of Viṣhṇu's aspect, because He's got the sixteen phases completely done.<br />
So today's number is sixteen. Six plus one: seven.<br />
Now we have to understand the importance of guru. <b>Why should we have a guru when we have God?</b> We've got Śhakti, then why should we have a guru? <b>What is the need to have a guru?</b><br />
Guru means the weight, the weight. We get our weight from the magnetic forces of the gravity of the Mother Earth. So, guru means gravity: the gravity in a person.<br />
<b>Why do we need a guru?</b><br />
Because to know God is easy, specially in Sahaja Yoga, to be one with Him. As soon as you get your Self-realization in Sahaja Yoga, the modern Sahaja Yoga, immediately you become entitled to give Realizations to other people.<br />
It was said that, ``Guru is the person who makes you meet the Divine." But's not true. Because any self-realized person, in the Sahaja Yoga, can raise the Kuṇḍalinī and king ... can give Self-realization to others, immediately after they have touched the Sahasrāra or opened the Sahasrāra. But normally a realized Soul cannot do it. Any born realized Soul cannot do it on its own: it has to have authority of Me, as I am today.<br />
That's why it was said that, ``Guru is a person who makes you meet God": he raises the Kuṇḍalinī and makes you one with God."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Sahaja Yoga is very different from all other gurus that we believe in the Power of Love. Power of Love teaches you how to be forgiving, it makes you noble, it makes you very balanced.</b><br />
So, the gurus who were there for Bhavasāgara, to establish dharma in the human beings, first thing, they had to balance themselves against all practical things, as they call it. They think is not practical! But they said, ``No! For us, this is higher, nobler and important." <b>So they would balance people because they had this Power of Love within themselves.

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we are going to do the Pūjā of Ādi Śhakti.</b><br />
It's a difficult subject uuh to talk about Ādi Śhakti, because is not easy to understand that Ādi Śhakti is the Power of Sadāśhiva. Sadāśhiva is the God Almighty. She is His breath, as they some people call it. <b>Some say She is the Desire and some say that She's the Entire Power of Sadāśhiva and Sadāśhiva cannot do anything without Her Powers.</b><br />
......<br />
The first thing is, we must know, that She created a Kuṇḍalinī in the Mother Earth Itself and She created Śhrī Gaṇeśha out of the Mother Earth, it's very interesting.<br />
So, the Mother Earth becomes a very important thing for us. If we do not know how to respect the Mother Earth, we do not know how to respect ourselves.<br />
The expression of Ādi Śhakti within you is the Kuṇḍalinī, no doubt. That is the reflection of Ādi Śhakti in you. But the reflection in the Mother Earth is also expressed, as you all know, in different places, different countries, different cities as the manifestation of chakras and Ādi Śhakti's creations. It was very important first to create a very holy Mother Earth for human beings to be born on them [it]. So the reflection of the Ādi Śhakti as Kuṇḍalinī first was on the Mother Earth.<br />
Kuṇḍalinī is a, we should say, is a wee part of the Ādi Śhakti. <b>Or we can say that She is the desire, pure desire of the Ādi Śhakti. So Ādi Śhakti is the desire, complete desire of Sadāśhiva, and Kuṇḍalinī, Ādi Kuṇḍalinī, is the desire, complete desire of Ādi Śhakti.</b>"</font><br />

Is very important that this Pūjā must be performed.</b> Because that is how you grow, this reflection improves, and you grow more and more within yourself, through the Power of Ādi Śhakti or through the power of Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
As you know that: Ādi Śhakti has Her own Kuṇḍalinī, which is the Ādi Kuṇḍalinī, and the reflection of that, within you, is the Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
So you have to worship. And is the best way to please your own Kuṇḍalinī, your own mother, who has given you this birth."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we have gathered here to do the Kuṇḍalinī Pūjā, or the Ādi Śhakti Pūjā.</b><br />
There's a difference between the two: <b>Ādi Śhakti is the Total Power of God, of His Desire, while [Ādi] Kuṇḍalinī is the One that is reflected, part which is reflected in the human beings as Kuṇḍalinī.</b> So there's a difference between the Ādi Kuṇḍalinī and the Ādi Śhakti.<br />
<b>Ādi Śhakti is the Parāśhakti, is the Power which is beyond all the powers, which controls all the powers. And one of the powers of Ādi Śhakti is Kuṇḍalinī.</b><br />
For example, the Kuṇḍalinī which is placed within Me, in the triangular bone, is not [the] totality of Me. In the same way, the Kuṇḍalinī, which is placed within you, is not the totality. Of course, It is the power which is there to give you your Self-realization. Is the power that redeems you, that nourishes you, that enlightens your centers.<br />
But there are two other powers, as you know, very powerful, which are working through Iḍā and Piṅgalā. And the third one is Mahālakṣhmī which is in the center. "</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So, in that reflection that you are Me, in that rekflection [reflection] that the Mother Earth is Me</b>, in that beautiful creation within you, you have to become very sensitive to the need of the world, what is the need of the world. <b>Today, if you fail, the whole thing will fail forever.</b> Only very few will be there. So the need for you is: to spread Sahaja Yoga because this love is not only for you. Is not to be enjoyed [only] by you, but is to be enjoyed by as many possible in the whole world.<br />
<b>So, today we have to decide that, as the children of Ādi Śhakti, we have to go all out, everywhere, every corner, we have to shout and we have to tell loudly what is the time in which we are living and what is the responsibility that you have to fulfill as Sahaja Yogis.</b>"</font><br />

......<br />
So this Ādi Śhakti's Love is something so, so subtle, is so subtle. You cannot understand sometimes. I know you all love Me very much. It's tremendous love for Me, and when I get the vibrations from you, it is like the ripples that reach the shores and again they return back and lots of little, little sparkling drops are there, on the shore also. In the same way in My heart I feel your love echoing the beauty of this Divine Love ... which I cannot la explain to you the experience that it creates.

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we are all going to worship Me, first time. It has been always the Pūjā of [an] aspect of Me or a part of Me.</b><br />
Now, one has to know very clearly what is Ādi Śhakti. As we say, is the Pure Desire of God Almighty, of Sadāśhiva. But what is the pure Desire of God Almighty?<br />
If you see your own desires, come out of what? Not out of the Divine Love but out of carnal love, out of material love, of out of power love. Behind all these desires there is love.<br />
If you do not love something you will not desire it. So, these mundane types of love that you have, for which we spend so much of our time uselessly, actually they do not give you satisfaction, because that is not true love that you have. Just infatuation for the time being, and then you just get fed up with it, and from there you jump to another thing, to another thing, to another thing.<br />
So <b>Ādi Śhakti is the Embodiment of God's Divine Love, is God's Pure Love, and in His Love what did He desire? He desired that He should create human beings, who would be very obedient, would be sublime, would be like angels. And that was His idea: to create Adam and Eve.</b>"</font><br />

Because when the enthusiastic Deities start emitting vibrations with your im... asking. Because you are Saints, so They just, They are overenthusiastic. And They are sitting there, busybodies, you know [soft laughter]. They are sitting quietly waiting for a chance, you see, to emit vibrations, to save you, you see, They want to just rush. They emit so much [laughing:] that They lose, 'Just wait, just wait.' They want to save you, They want to give you, They're so anxious, in Their anxiety to save you. I like it, to see the way They are anxious. But [laughs] ... but you don't suck it and I have a problem there. Once They've given They don't want to take it back. You don't suck it, so it has to go to the atmosphere, it has to disappear somewhere. Is directed towards you and you don't take it, so where does it go? It hangs into My tissues, it pains Me.<br />
So, sucking should be more. Sucking should be more. <b>And just before the Pūjā you should say: 'Mother, make me such that I suck more of the Divine!' Just pray that, with sincerity from your heart, just say that.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"It's nice today it's Mother's Day, and You find so many people waiting for You.<br />
And also You see Yourself as a Mother, the heart which is pining to meet, then You can't get out of some things. And then You enjoy that pining, that longing to see Your own, Your own children whom You love so much. Is such a great joy.<br />
In these modern times, it is described that in this Kali Yuga everything will go upside down because people will not recognize the motherhood. The mothers won't be respected and won't be respectable either. Is a fact.<br />
And imagine now this has brought this Mother's Day to this country. It's something, such a recognition from the Divine that one has to remember that motherhood is very important.<br />
......<br />
<b>So the power that your Mother has, of giving birth, the spiritual birth, be bestowed upon all of you so that you do this work with the same grace and with the same patience and love and enjoyment.<br />
May God bless you.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"[Mother's is] a very special institution ...... especially in this country [Italy], they have such respect for their mothers.<br />
<b>Mother is the Source of Love.</b> In the Qur'ān they asked Muhammad Sāhab whom should we bow after Allah? So He said "to Mother" -- "to the Mother."<br />
Then again they asked Him, He said: "Only the Mother." Again they asked Him, He said: "Only the Mother."<br />
I'm sure He must have said about the Divine Mother, because worldly mothers may not be complete mothers, perhaps. They are a[n] embodied, or, we can say, examples of Mother's Love, of the Divine Mother's Love, but they are human.<br />
So they can be conditioned, influenced or could be egoistical, especially if they are living in a particular country for a long time and have no idea of Divine Love.<br />
<b>In Divine Love there is no expectations, it just flows, it doesn't think how to judge a person or what to do for a person, it just flows.</b>"</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Today is ... I like the day when it is the Mother’s, I should say, Mother’s Day also. Because I think only a Mother can work it out that way. One has to have a lot of patience with people.<br />
.......<br />
But mother’s position is different. She’ll go on struggling and fighting for her child. She’ll fight it out to the last to see that the child gets all the benefits and this patience and this love and this forgiveness is innately built-in in a mother, because her attitude is very different. Not any achievement, not any big name or what you call a sort of an award or anything. It is just she does it because she is a mother. And that is what is the sign of any mother, if she is a real mother, at least for her own children, she will go all out, she will work out everything for day in day out and to save the child from disaster. But Sahaja Yoga is a much bigger family and for that you really had to be worked out through the Mother’s Principle. You cannot take any other principle.<br />
......<br />
So, in your own way, when you are doing Sahaja Yoga, there also you have to be a mother. <b>More mother’s quality than the father’s quality, that there’s no ambition, there’s no competition, there’s no jealousies, nothing.</b> Just you want your children to come up and to grow into their spirituality. If that is the only attitude we have then you’ll be amazed how satisfied you’ll feel, because this is a very, very joy-giving thing, to see people growing in spirituality. Not only talking about it, not only reading about it, but actually happening, actualizing within yourself. So this quality is very helpful and that really helps every Sahaja Yogi to be patient, to be kind, to be humble."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is a very great day, I must say, to celebrate Sahasrāra, the Pūjā of Sahasrāra.</b><br />
It’s a very unique thing that has happened, that your Sahasrāras were opened out.<br />
......<br /> 
So it's a very great day because collectively this Sahasrāra has been opened. Every one of you have got it. Also all over the world, you have many people who have got their Sahasrāras open. Of course, we need many more for them to understand what is this great event of such a collective opening of Sahasrāra.<br />
Some have grown very much, after getting their Realization, very much. They have understood Sahaja Yoga very well, and they have developed their depth, and their consciousness is really a great awareness of Oneness with the Divine.<br />

<font color="DarkRed">"I have to tell ... I'll have to tell you the story about the Sahasrāra Day, about which it was decided, long time back, before I incarnated. They had a big meeting in the Heavens, all the thirty-five karoṛs [350 millions] of Gods, the Deities were there present to decide what is to be done. <b>'This is the ultimate that we have to do to human beings: is to open their Sahasrāra, to open their awareness to the Spirit, to the Real Knowledge of the Divine, to remove the darkness of ignorance.'</b> And it had to be spontaneous because it has to work the living force of God. Also, it had to be very quick. So all the Gods requested that now, I, the Ādi Śhakti has to take the birth.<br />
They all tried Their best. They did whatever was possible. The Saints were made by Them but very few. They incarnated and people made religions out of Them which were perverted, brought Them bad name. No reality in those religions. These religions were money-oriented or power-oriented. There was no Divine Force working, actually, it was all anti-Divine."</font><br />

The deity of Sahasrāra is a very simple person, extremely simple, and can be moved with very little actions,<br />
can be pleased with very few little actions here and there.<br />
Not much is needed to please the deity of Sahasrāra.<br />
It’s a very simple person. Little things make Her happy."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"It has been such a great pleasure and glorification of Sahaja Yoga today, I remember the day when it started, on the 5th May 1970. And today I see all of you so much engulfed in the Divine Love and Divine Power.<br />
<b>The whole thing shows one very great, fundamental thing, of Sahasrāra: that people from so many countries integrated together.</b><br />
Integrated. It was Sahaj, spontaneous, but every way and there was no confusion, there’s no quarreling, no fighting, nothing. Such an integration, spontaneous, whether it is on the stage or stage of life.<br />
Now, as we are all global personalities, we are all integrated and those who were acting were enjoying as well as the ones who were looking at them were also enjoying in the same manner.<br />
It was such a good also integration between the one who was acting, or the all those who were there, and all those who were watching – I couldn’t understand whether the people who are seeing them are also acting, or also those who are acting are also seeing.<br />
It was a beautiful blending I must say, and I congratulate all the leaders of all these five countries, who have contributed so well to this deep sense of integration.<br />
Not that is the integration within that is important – of course that’s very important for a personality, but for our work, for our global emancipation we need integration of all the nations, and understanding of all the nations, because these barriers are created by human beings, not by God Almighty.<br />
So we have transcended those barriers, and the way we are all sitting together in a complete integrated mood is – you don’t know what your Mother feels, I, I just can’t believe that in such a short time this we have achieved, in My lifetime I can see all these things happening.<br />
So it was such a beautiful sahaja, spontaneous, creation of the Spirit of this integration, and I congratulate all the leaders for this, and we all should thank them, for giving us this beautiful integrated, Sahaj spontaneous illustration of [the] Sahaj character.<br />
Thank you very much.<br />
May God bless you all."</font><br />

Let us see what is the quality of the cells of Sahasrāra. These are specially created cells through the working of the Swādhiṣhṭhāna.

<font color="DarkRed">"So after so many days, the Sahasrāra has been opened out. We have to open out our Sahasrāra again.<br />

<b>Once you jump in the Ocean of Love there’s nothing to be done! Just to be enjoyed: every wave of it, every hue of it, every touch of it. That is what one has to learn by reasoning that, ‘Sahaja Yoga is nothing but is Love.'</b><br />

You have to rise into that new realm, which is the Realm of God Almighty, what you call the Kingdom of God.<br />
And He said it very clearly to Nicodemus that, "You have to be born-again." And when he asked: "Am I to enter back into my mother's womb to be born again?" And He said it so clearly! It's so clear! Those who don't want to see can remain blind! But he said it very-very clearly that, "No! That is, whatever is born of the flesh is the flesh, but whatever is born of the Spirit is the Spirit."<br />
I mean, nothing could be more clear than that, that it has to be born of the Spirit."</font><br />

We will adulate Him by singing His praises<br />
<b>Hrudi mam basale prabhu majhe vijayi zhale</b><br />
He has now created a permanent abode in my heart because of His glorious victory over death.</font>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Now, as you know that He created all the Brahmāṇḍas. Brahman means an [a] universe.<br />
Now, the universe of the Sun, out of that universe has come out this Earth. Out of that you have come out.<br />
And in your Āgñyā chakra He has created a small Virāṭa, as they call it. He exists within your Āgñyā chakra.<br />
<b>This sacrifice is very, very significant. And, though it is gross, in subtle it has happened. To take the awareness through this center of Āgñyā was done by Christ, by His crucifixion.<br />
He came as a gross person, just like a gross human being.<br />
His body died, but did not die, because that body was also made of that imperishable Divine Vibrations, as you call, a Radiations or this Brahma. They did not die. And that's why the body did not die and He resurrected with His body.<br />
He had to die to show that the body though [it] dies, can be saved. That's why He had to be crucified.</b> Otherwise He could not have shown you.<br />
But it's actually it was experimented in the Vaikuṇṭha, as you call it, that He died and then resurrected to show that this does not die.<br />
Kṛiṣhṇa has said, "Nainaṃ chindanti śhastrāṇi, nainaṃ dahati pāvakaḥ" [Bhagavad Gītā 2.23, line 1]. "It is not killed by any weapon, neither it is burned by any fires, nor it is blown by any wind." "Na chainaṃ kledayanty āpo, na śhoṣhayati mārutaḥ"[Bhagavad Gītā 2.23, line 2]. "Neither, nothing can suck in." That Spirit is He.<br />
......<br />
But again you cannot crucify Him. Now He has become Ekādeśha Rudra as described, the Eleven Rudras as you know very well. These are all the Powers of Śhiva given to Him.<br />
<b>Up till now, till He was born, Kṛiṣhṇa had given Him His Powers, and that He became Mahāvirā[ṭ]. He was even placed above Kṛiṣhṇa.</b><br /> 
But now, when He will come, He'll be bestowed with the Destructive Powers of Śhiva, eleven of them. One is sufficient to finish all the universes. And that's what is described as the coming of the Christ. You cannot crucify Him anymore.<br />
And the time has come for all of us to be prepared for us to receive Him. We are not yet ready to receive Him. Unless and until you are realized, you cannot receive Him, because if you remain unrealized till He comes, you'll be finished, you'll be gone, you'll be destroyed. He'll just come to destroy all the nonsensical things. So this short time should be used for your emancipation and for your development.<br />
......<br />
<b>For us, Sahaja Yogis, it is important to understand the significance of Christ's life. That His body was the only body who was made of these Radiations.</b><br />
All other bodies were human bodies. All the Incarnations, even that of Kṛiṣhṇa's when He came on this Earth, were having human qualities that Mother Earth existed in the body."</font><br />

So we celebrate Easter to show Christ resurrected Himself. The Spirit that is Christ has to resurrect out of the material manifestation of the Divine Itself. The matter is manifested because we ourselves have created it. Not that we are born out of matter, our body, but we are attached to it, we want it, we want to have it. Whatever you want, that sustains itself, by your desire, because now you are on the stage. If you want to sustain the matter, if you want to keep the matter as the first priority, it will remain. It cannot disappear. It has to go out of your mind that matter cannot hold you any further.<br />
Christ rose out of the matter, came out of the tomb which symbolizes the matter which has enclosed us within, which has to be opened out with our spiritual power. Throw away the stone that is covering this grave. Get out of that and stand outside it. This is the message of Christ's Resurrection."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are celebrating Hanumāna's Jayanti [birthday].</b><br />
What to say about Hanumāna? <b>The more powerful and wise, he was equally devoted and dedicated.</b> Generally, such a powerful person becomes right-sided and considers himself so high that he would not listen to anyone else. But <b>Hanumāna is a special Deity, a typical Deity full of qualities. There was a perfect balance between his devotion and power.</b> How could he achieve this balance is a thing to be understood.<br />
In Sahaja Yoga, when we are enlightened, we get many powers. Then we have to keep balance. We love others and with the power of the love, we keep on doing our duties.<br />
Śhrī Hanumāna was very powerful. He had many Divine Powers in Him Navadhā, that is Garima, Laghima, etc. He could be as big as he wanted to be and as small as an atom. He had achieved all these powers. Without attaining balance and coming to the central path. Such a powerful person generally goes crazy.<br />

<font color="blue">"<b>What we have to learn from Śhrī Hanumāna is this devotion (bhakti) and the power that he has given to you. If your devotion is real, then no one dares touch you. No one could touch.</b><br />
There are thousands of examples in Sahaja Yoga. People call them miracles. But I say that it is no miracle, it is the blessing of Śhrī Hanumāna.<br /> 
<b>So My blessings and Love to you all. Love yourself, also love others.</b><br /> 
Do not confine your love to “my son, my this, my that.” No! Love means selfless love (Nirvāja Pyār) love that expects no return, love that is not confined to relations only. You have been blessed with such unfathomable Power of Love. Use it.<br />
Infinite blessings."</font><br />

<font color="blue">"It is such a joy today, and the whole atmosphere seems to be bubbling with it as if the angels are singing.<br />
And <b>the specialty of Hanumāna was that He was an angel.</b> Angels are born like angels. They are angels, and they are not human beings.<br /> 
They’re born with the angelic qualities. But now, you all have become angels from the human beings. It’s a very great achievement of Sahaja Yoga.<br /> 
The qualities that are born with the angels are seen from their very childhood."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Hanumāna’s whole life was spent in serving Śhrī Rām. And He was such a dedicated bhakta of Śhrī Rām.</b><br />
Now here the contrast is also that Hanumāna had Navadhā, Navadhā uh-uh Siddhis, Navadhā Siddhis, Nine Siddhis: the Aṇima, Garima, Raguma [Laghima], and all sorts of things, that He could become small, He could become big, He could ... it so many things He had. Despite all these siddhis and the amount the [of] power He had, that Śhrī Rāma once asked Him that, “My s... My ah-ah-ah brother now, uh Lakṣhmaṇa, is being hit and He’s very sick. I mean, He’s just dying, so you go and get a particular kind of a sañjīvanī, a kind of a[n] herb, is which I want to rub on His head.” So He went there and He found He couldn’t find it so He brought the whole of the mountain on His hand and [laughing:] gave it to Rāma, “Now You select! I don’t know, I can’t find it.” [Soft laughter.]<br />
<b>That is the Hanumāna Śhakti! And with all that power, He was such a humble person and such a dedicated person.</b><br />
<b>This is the sign of a powerful Sahaja Yogi. Anybody who is powerful has to be humble and nonviolent.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"I hope by today’s Pūjā, that enthusiasm, that venturesome nature will vibrate your Piṅgalā, and without feeling any ego about it, in the most humble manner as Hanumāna was, you will do the jobs.<br />
Obedience is the only thing that helps to carry out your work and you’ll become humbler and humbler.<br />
But if you think, ‘Oh I am doing this,’ then finished. <b>But if you know that it’s done by the Divine – ‘Paramachaitanya is doing everything, I am just an instrument,’ the humility will be there and you will be an effective instrument.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Now, <b>He’s the one who protects also all the deities, He protects.</b> Now, there’s a difference between Shri Ganesha and Him. The Shri Ganesha gives energy Shakti, but the one who protects is Shri Hanumana. So you’ll find that when Shri Krishna was the chariot[eer] of Arjuna then on top of the chariot was sitting Hanumana, not Shri Ganesh. Hanumana was sitting there looking after Him. Also in a way that Shri Rama Himself becomes Shri Vishnu, so He has to look after Him."</font><br />
