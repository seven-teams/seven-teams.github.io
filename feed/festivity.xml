<font color="DarkRed">"Today we have come here to do Hanumāna's Pūjā. 

Śhrī Hanumāna is a great character in our being and He runs all the way from Swādhiṣhṭhāna to your brain and He supplies all the necessary guidance we need in our futuristic planning or in our mental activities. He gives us guidance and protection.<br />
......<br />
It is very surprising how a Deity like Śhrī Hanumāna, who is an eternal child, because He was like a monkey. His head was that of a monkey, if not of an elephant.<br />
So He was an eternal child and He was the one who was used to run the right side of human beings. He was told that, ``You must control the Sun," to begin with He has to control the Sun, that the Sun in the people, if there is too much Sun then He must try to control it and make it cooler or smoother."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"It is such a joy today, and the whole atmosphere seems to be bubbling with it, as if the angels are singing. And the speciality of Hanumāna was that He was an angel. Angels are born like angels. They are angels, and they are not human beings. They're born with the angelic qualities. But now, you all have become angels from the human beings. It's a very great achievement of Sahaja Yoga. The qualities that are born with the angels are seen from their very childhood."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are celebrating Hanumāna's Jayanti</b> [birthday].<br />
What to say about Hanumāna? The more powerful and wise, He was equally devoted and dedicated.<br />
Generally such a powerful person becomes right-sided and considers himself so high that he would not listen to anyone else.<br />
But <b>Hanumāna is a special Deity, a typical Deity full of qualities. There was a perfect balance between his devotion and power</b>. How could he achieve this balance is a thing to be understood. In Sahaja Yoga, when we are enlightened, we get many powers. Then we have to keep balance. We love others and with the power of the love, we keep on doing our duties.<br />
Śhrī Hanumāna was very powerful. He had many Divine Powers in Him Navadhā, that is Garima, Laghima, etc. He could be as big as he wanted to be and as small as an atom. He had achieved all these powers."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So in the left side we have gaṇas, on the right side we have angels. And translated in Sanskrit language or in any Indian language as Devadūt -- means they are the Ambassadors of Gods.<br /> 
So now you are the same, you are all angels now.</b> Only thing you are not aware that you are angels while they were aware from their childhood. If you know that you are angels, all your qualities will start shining through, and you'll be amazed that the quality of standing by the Truth at any cost is so easily managed for you, because you have been given the right, you have been given the special blessings, the special protection from the Divine that if you stand for the right, and if you stand for the righteous, and if you stand for the Truth, all kinds of help to protect you will be given."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Even His sevaka [most obedient worshiper] Śhrī Hanumāna was an ideal disciple to be emulated by all the Sahaja Yogis. He was of Great Powers. He is an innocent personality of a very high order, always keen to perform the task set out for Him by Śhrī Rāma. Later on also He appeared during the Incarnation of Śhrī Viṣhṇu as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa and used to ride on the top of the chariot of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br />
<b>He is known as Chirañjīv, an eternal being, one of the seven eternal personalities. He also comes and helps and performs all the tasks assigned to Him. He is always present in all My Pūjās</b> and on one occasion He had been visible in vibratory form, in one of the Photographs taken in Bombay [Mumbai]."</font><br />

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"We say that Sahaja Yoga is the work of Divine Love. It's right, whether we know it or not, Its power is innate. It is Divine Power. <b>When a human being bows before someone and regards him higher, it is the expression of that Divine Power.</b> But when a person is respectful to his guru then he gets blessed with the grace and power of the guru.<br /> 
So <b>the devotion and the power (bhakti aur śhakti) are not different things. It is one. We shall say that the right side is the source of power and the left of bhakti. Śhrī Hanumāna had in Him this harmony of bhakti and śhakti</b>."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Śhrī Gaṇeśha and Śhrī Hanumāna are the Incarnations of this Divine Wisdom.</b> Śhrī Hanumāna was very powerful and fast and Śhrī Gaṇeśha is cool-natured. But when required, both are very big hitters. They remain with you every moment. Whenever anyone troubles you, your protectors are there. Often you see that security moves with the ministers and VIPs. The security of Sahaja Yogis also moves with them; that is, the security of gaṇas. Gaṇas have many things to do. Gaṇapati -- <b>Śhrī Gaṇeśha keeps them informed about you as to where is the problem, from where you are getting attacked and troubled. You do not know that if anybody wants to attack you secretly, even then these God's gaṇas stand by you. When Śhrī Gaṇapati informs about it, Śhrī Hanumāna sets them right</b>. So Sahaja Yogis have no need to be frightened. No need at all to be frightened."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So that is very important, especially <b>in the West where it's being really dangerously destroyed, the idea of auspiciousness and of holiness. So that is the power of any angel and that has to be fully established within us, and then on that power will work out, which gives you discretion, which gives you egolessness.</b><br />
I hope today both these things will work out within us in such a manner that we really become absolutely self-confident realized Souls whom I call as angels of modern times."</font><br />

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"I hope today you have understood the subtle side of your being which is there, which is exhibiting, which I can see clearly and that you will, all of you will, <b>in your meditation become aware of what you have within yourself.

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are going to celebrate the birthday of Mahāvīra.<br />
Mahāvīra is the Incarnation of Bhairavanāth, or you call Him as Saint Michael.</b> Now these two Saints as you know one as the Gabriel, Hanumāna, and another is Saint Michael. One is placed on the Piṅgalā nāḍī and another one, Saint Michael, on the Iḍā nāḍī.<br />
So, Mahāvīra had to go through lots of search. Of course He was a[n] angel, but came as human being and He had to find out the thing of the left side, and how the left side acts. It's a very complicated thing, left side, is much more complicated than right side. On the left side we have also seven nāḍīs, and these seven nāḍīs are placed one after another. They are described in books and given different names to them. Now these seven nāḍīs that are on the left side, as you know, they cater to our past. Say for example, every moment becomes a past. Every present becomes a past. Then we have past of this lifetime, and also we have past of our previous lives. Then all the past is built in within us since our creation."</font><br />

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="blue">"Now, Mahāvīra also was one of Them, who ... who was born again and again, and He was Mārkaṇḍeya, and He was Kabīra.<br />
The way Kabīra lashes people, you can see that He is tremendous! <b>He is like Bhairava!</b>"</font><br />

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"The ascetic life of Mahāvīra was of a very, very extreme nature. He was the one who was born in a ... uh ... clan of warriors, Kṣhatriyas. And then He was also married, also He had a daughter. And then He decided, because He knew He had to do the work of the Divine, He decided to take a saṃnyāsa. So He took uh the permission of His brother because His parents were dead. He was a king, so He gave up all His uh material wealth, everything and He beg ... became a complete saṃnyāsī. And the He left His family, His left His ... house, everything behind and went alone with a little bowl for begging alms. And there people who joined Him were very few, and He asked them that, "You have to also become ascetics," Munis.<br />
He was a Reincarnation of Saint Michael and He resides on the left side, on the Iḍā nāḍī. And He looks after the whole of it, right from Mūlādhāra onwards up to the Sahasrāra. So Saint Michael was born as Mahāvīra, meaning The Greatest Warrior. But when He was born, the whole place got lot of uh prosperity, that's why <b>He was called as Vardhamān, to begin with.</b>"</font><br />

</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>After they get their Realization, that He called as Kevalagyān: only the knowledge, only knowledge, means Pure Knowledge.</b> They will develop some Samyak Darśhan, means Integrated Personality and all the Collective Consciousness. He talked of all, all these things.<br /> 
But as He belonged to the left side, He has described Hell very clearly. Fundamentally, basically there are Fourteen Hells according to Him. And is horrible to read all that, what He has described about Hell. Because He wanted to tell people that, 'If you do all these wrong things, you'll go to Hell.'<br /> 
And He talked about, not about Form, Formly God, but Formless God, because He didn't want people to again start ritualism but get to right ... right to the position where they could get their Self-realization to cleanse themself.<br />
So you can imagine: how difficult, in those days at Mahāvīra, was even to be one of the candidates for Self-realization. It's frightening for you! <b>That's why I never had this uh Pūjā. Because to do all these things, first of all, and to become absolutely pure, then only He would give Realization.</b>"</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"That's why, <b>I think, this Mahāvīra Jayanti is a very great thing for us to observe.</b><br />
Now, why was He called Mahāvīra? Because only a person like Him -- Vir means a person who is brave, who is chivalrous -- because only He could do this, so only He could enter into the being fully and could kill or, you can say, destroy those horrible rākṣhasas, devils, all these negative things that come to us.<br />
Now, as you know, we use left side very much for so many negativity that is torturing us, but if there is no help, say, from Mahāvīra, we cannot do it. You call the name of Mahāvīra -- you could call Him Saint Michael, you can call Him by any name, but Mahāvīra because He was a human being. All this works out because of Him and He's such a great identity."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Even though Saraswatī has created all the Swaras, so what! <b>But the emotions it contains, the bhakti it contains it is due to the blessings of Mahāvīr.</b> Mahāvīr has really worked hard for this because he scared people that if you go to the wrong way, you go to hell, and on taking this correct way you will be overwhelmed and you all are actually witnessing it. Like this <b>we all should increase our bhakti and growing bhakti in the work of Mahāvīr. I am happy that on this day of Mahāvīr Jayanti you all are doing Mahāvīr's work</b> ......<br />
In Sahaja Yoga we recognize Lord Mahāvīra as the Incarnation of Śhrī Bhairavnāth. He also incarnated as Imam Husayn. Saint Michael is the same who is also called Saint George [the Guardian angel of London]."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>We have gathered here on the occasion of Rām Navamī.</b> Everybody has said, "Mother please tell us about Śhrī Rām."<br />
You know that Śhrī Rāma has a very important place on our chakra, He is situated on our right Heart. Śhrī Rāma has taken the place of father, hence if there is lack in the responsibility or love from father this chakra is caught.<br />
In Sahaja Yoga we too understand that Śhrī Rāma and all other Deities have taken the form to fulfill Their divine work, in all Śhrī Rāma had a special task. As it was said by Socrates that the Benevolent King has to come the same way Śhrī Rāma had come on this Earth as benevolent king, He came in the form of human being, He even forgot that He was Incarnation of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, forgot about Him but for all world He was Puruṣhottama Rāma.<br />
In Sahaja Yoga we need to know when we pray any Deity, we have imbibed the specialties and qualities of the particular Deity within us, Śhrī Rāma had many qualities.<br />
You all know his childhood life and you have already heard about his qualities, he was Puruṣhottama he had another quality that in his ruling, he did not care for his wife or children's in front of his subjects view."</font><br />

<font color="DarkGreen">"Śhrī Rāma Himself was born on the right side. Great example for all of you is Śhrī Rām who was on the right side, who works the right side. When He was born and He was a child ... <b>He is a Sūryavaṃśhi, He is the son of Sūrya, I mean, Sūrya's everything comes from the Sun to Him.</b> When He was born and was a little child, He asked His mother that, ``I would like have uh like to have the Moon." The [He] started crying, and nobody knew how to satisfy. He said, ``I want to have the Moon." They gave Him any toys, He threw away. Said, ``What a child it is‽ Funny thing! He wants to have the Moon, now how to get Him the moon?" They did not know how to solve the problem. He said, ``Somehow you get Me the Moon. I don't want to eat or anything, I want to have the Moon." Here the Moon represents the Ātmā, the cooling [smiling:] capacity. He asked for the Moon.<br />
You are all on the right side, so ask for the Moon. Ask for the Spirit.<br />
And they didn't know how to satisfy this Śhrī Rāma, who was the [laughing:] Incarnation of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, [laughing:] asking for the Moon of all the things, not for anything else. What's so important? So, the mother has always a[n] intuition. She brought a -- it's a, it's a māyā, it's a beautiful drama -- she brought a mirror and showed Him the Moon in the mirror. He [she] said, ``Now, you can get the Moon here." [Laughter, laughs.] So sweet! And He was satisfied! Even the reflection of that can satisfy.<br />
You are like the mirrors and I want to see the reflection of Moon [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] in you. "</font><br />

The idea of a king related to God came from Śhrī Rāma.</b><br /> 
But the modern kings are not like that, they have no relation with God. On the contrary, they are horrid people. Some of them are nothing but satanic people, absolutely Satan is there and you can see from the way they lead their lives, and they have led their life before. So the benevolence of Śhrī Rāma is here [shows the right Heart] to be followed by all the political leaders and all the people who are at the helm of affairs. He is the ideal that was created for human beings, to run their authority as the head, or the loving compassionate benevolent leader of the people, who has to govern them by making them respectful, by respect. And if human beings create such things who are not respectable, those who have no human values, those who have no moral courage, those who are selfish, those who are self-centered, then they have nothing to do to be there.<br />
<b>So this is the position of Rāma who is the Father. So the head of every state has to be the father of his subjects, that's what He has tried to show by His life. So much so that He had to sacrifice His beloved Wife, whom He loved so much.</b>"</font><br />

All these Powers are there for us to ascent. If these Powers are properly used and understood, then your ascent can be permanent. Once you achieve your ascent and enter into the Kingdom of God, all these Powers get enlightened.<br />
And these Powers which are enlightened are absolutely filled with Love. Enlightenment, we have to understand that we get completely enlightened by Love. So after enlightenment, after Realization we use only one Power which is of Love."</font><br />

All these powers which are present in the dormant state are endless, nor anybody can guess their limit because as an example there are 35 crores [350 million] Deities seated within you. Apart from that there are several powers that are running them, but at least we can understand that the Self-realization that we received today, certainly <b>some Śhaktis must have worked this out.

On this day Devī is worshiped as Śhailaputrī, means the daughter of Himalaya.</b> Devī has many other names also but first of all She incarnated as Śhailaputrī in the cold of Himalayas. She incarnated and whatever She was to do, She started there.<br />
Further story is known to you. [King] Dakṣha did not invite Lord Śhiva in the Havana that he performed and Śhailaputrī was the consort of Lord Śhiva. She is called Satī because She entered the Holy fire of Havana and ablated Herself. But by then Lord Śhiva reached there. He lifted Her burnt up body from the fire. Burnt pieces of the body of Śhailaputrī fell at many places. All these places are considered to be Śhakti Pīṭhas, the places of worship, as there is in Vindhyāchala and many other places. Her power moves there and it is said that it Sanctifies everything.<br />
Her seventh power is considered to be the Power of Destruction. Śhakti manifested Itself on the right side as Sāvitrī and Gāyatrī but the destroying force was manifested in the center.<br />
In the form of Durgā and Her other forms manifested in Heart chakra. She is present there.<br />
If some one hurts you, confuses or disturbs you then this power will protect you and destroy your enemy.<br />
When Kuṇḍalinī rises and reaches the Heart chakra then it manifests and becomes more powerful and effective because Kuṇḍalinī is Jagadambā. In Sahaja Yoga when Kuṇḍalinī is awakened it settles in Heart chakra. It protects you and takes care of you nicely."</font><br />

But the symbol of Śhālivāhana used to be guḍhī means a flag and above that a pitcher having a particular shape, which represented the Kuṇḍalinī.

That is the reason that they have made this thing like that and all those, who accept it, put up a 'guḍhī' in their houses. They [Śhālivāhans] wanted to welcome Kuṇḍalinī on this day and Kuṇḍalinī [in the form of pitcher] was exhibited specially on that day."</font><br />

With respect to the Guḍhī Pāḍavā the shawl has great significance. The Śhālivāhan Kings always carried the Goddess's shawl with them. You know the significance of Devī's shawl. You know it gives Her beauty. With the shawl She protects Herself from cold and wind. Also with it She protects Her chastity, as well as if any dirt is about to touch Her body it is prevented. So, a shawl which is offered to Goddess symbolizes Her protection, meaning, 'As You protect us we offer You this.' Further if the children are sleeping or are sick or have a problem, then She covers them with the shawl. So shawl is very important. You know, in the past it was a practice with all people in Maharashtra to take [put a] shawl over their bodies. Now that we have become modern we do not take it."</font><br />

So they were the worshipers of Kuṇḍalinī and followed it. That is the reason they made this symbol in this way. All those who follow Kuṇḍalinī put up a guḍhī in their houses and also put a flag on it and thus it is indicated that they welcome Kuṇḍalinī and exhibit it in a special way."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"As you know, <b>on the Day of Holī, Holikā was burnt</b>. Agni [God of Fire] had a very big blessing and task, because Agni Devatā had given Holikā a boon that in any circumstance, she will not burn, that death could come to her in any form, but not by fire. And after giving this boon, he regretted a lot because she took Prahlād in her lap and sat in the fire. And Agni Devatā had a big dilemma, that, "I have given this promise to her, that I will not burn her and how can I fulfill this promise? And Prahlād, is Himself innocence personified, He is Himself an Incarnation of Śhrī Gaṇeśha and how can I burn Him? Nobody can burn Him. And He is also beyond my powers. He is formed from my power." So he thought, "What is this ego? that in front of such a Great Power what can I talk about my power? I have no such power which can face Him. His Power is so great that I cannot burn Him whatsoever I may try. But at this time I have a very big dilemma in front of me."<br />
So in between duty and dharma the dilemma is in between these two. In this situation we must understand that dharma is higher than duty. <b>The duty of dharma is higher than a normal duty and even higher is the Dharma of the Ātmā.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Holī was started during the time of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.</b> Before Him in the time of Śhrī Rāma ... He was very austere. Because of that the society became very peaceful but people were devoid of all joy. So He thought that there should be a way by which people should be able to laugh freely and be joyful. And like it happens to all such ventures it happened in the case of Holī also that it produced an opposite effect.<br />
......<br />
<b>The story of how it started is like this.</b> There was a demoness called Holikā. She was the sister of Prahlād and Prahlād's father used to trouble him a lot. Holikā had a boon that she would not be burnt by the fire. Prahlād's father wanted to kill him and told Holikā to take the child [Prahlād] and sit on the burning pyre thinking that she would not die. But it is surprising that she died and Prahlād was not hurt in the fire and came out of it unscathed.<br />
This is a very big happening which demonstrated that it is very wrong to be cruel and aggressive. She had the boon but still she got burnt. That's why we have this custom on Holī.<br />
In our country [India] all such things have a lot of truthfulness. We have to understand that if we do wrong things, trouble others ... then these are demonic qualities.<br />
......<br />
We should not have these demonic qualities because we are Sahaja Yogis. We are a special race of people who have taken birth to transform this world and we should pay our attention towards that. We are very highly placed, higher than all others and we have to save all others from such tendencies. These days it has spread a lot. That's why all such hateful, cruel behavior by which we dominate others, torture others is very, very bad and there is no need to do all that in Sahaja Yoga."</font><br />

Why the joy of Holī?

Like in My family, in Lucknow, from where My family belongs, these people are landlords. So the sweeper does not dare to enter inside the house. People don't like them coming even their threshold, to that extent. They reprimanded them.<br />
But <b>on the Day of Holī, any person, whether he is a master or a servant, anybody, they all play Holī together</b>.

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Birthday of your Mother, and all such celebrations, have a very deep significance. Because on such occasions, special vibrations flow in the atmosphere.</b> When all the celestial bodies, the Eternal Personalities, Gods and Goddesses, s-s-sing the praise, and that's how the whole atmosphere is filled with mirth and happiness.<br />
Human beings also, express their gratitude. Expression of gratitude and love is done in different, different ways in different countries, but the substance remains the same and the forms change.<br />
The substance is like the ocean which flows continuously towards the shores, and the ripples which touch the shores are again repelled back, and a nice pattern is formed. It is such a spontaneous thing, and is so beautiful, creates such a beautiful pattern in the atmosphere. All these waves when they weave together the pattern of love, they soothe human beings, they enchant human beings, and the whole thing is very blissful.<br />
On such occasions a special type of feelings develop, which we cannot express in words so the expression could be in any form. But the main thing is the expression. <b>God has expressed Himself by Creation, by creating this Creation. While the Creation has to express its gratitude by glorifying Him, and this play must go on eternally. It's the most beautiful play.</b> Those who indulge into this play lead an eternal life. That life is unending, never breaks and binds the whole universe with its beautiful music. "</font><br />

And that the Ocean itself is going to strengthen them and look after them. It's the Ocean that is going to nourish them. And the same Ocean is going to guide them. So the connection between a drop and an Ocean has to be fully established. So the limitations of a drop have to be absolutely dissolved into the greatness of the Ocean.<br />

Out of the Highest Realm of Divinity, You have come on this Earth only because of Your infinite love, compassion and benevolence.<br />
Your powers, which created all the universes, are insurmountable.<br />

One has to only pray for the spiritual ascent. Because as you ascend, you get all the rest of it.<br />
Because you do not ascend, you not ... you do not get what is needed. That's why there are problems. And even today I had to solve some problems before I could come to Pūjā.<br />
But if you decide that, 'We have to ascend spiritually within us,' then everything that you have to receive, all the blessings that God wants to shower upon you, to make you the citizen of His Great Kingdom, where you are no more judged, you are no more chastised, you are no more put to any test, but where you'll reside in Eternal Love of God and in His glory.<br />

<b>First of all: you have to know you are Prophets and you must know that I am the Holy Ghost. I'm the Ādi Śhakti.

<font color="DarkRed">"We have all assembled here to worship Lord Śhiva. <b>Śhiva Pūjā is a very great and special Pūjā.<br />
The ultimate aim of human beings is to attain that Śhiva Tattwa.</b><br />
Śhiva Tattwa is beyond the brain. It cannot be known through the brain. Till you have got your Self-realization you cannot know the Self, Ātmā or the Śhiva Tattwa.<br />
Too much falsehood, myth and blind faith has taken place in the name of Lord Śhiva.<br />
Till a person is self-realized he cannot know Lord Śhiva because his nature is such that to know Him, a person has first to attain that height where all the great virtues themselves enshrine within.<br />
......<br />
These Śhaktis reside within us through the Śhiva Tattwa.<br />
To attain the Śhiva Tattwa, Self-realization is essential. Kuṇḍalinī is the Śhakti and the chakras are the steps. One has to ascend all the steps to attain the Śhiva Tattwa.<br />
This is the revelation of all the Gods and Deities. This is Their job and They are completely absorbed in it. Unlike human beings, They do not think about themselves or their rank, etc. They are a part and parcel of Lord Śhiva. To facilitate human ascent to the Śhiva Tattwa is Their nature.<br />
They need not be lectured or told anything, They are completely submerged in Their task. They work in a karma. They do not think They are doing anything. They are thoughtless and unmindful for their powers, like sugar gives sweetness to food, but is unaware that it is sweet.<br />
Similarly, when Sahaja Yogis act, they are not aware of the Śhakti within which is behind their actions. If the consciousness comes that, 'I am the doer,' 'I am a leader,' etc. then you are not a Sahaja Yogi. Through Sahaja Yoga one becomes akarmi. He keeps performing without even remembering that he is doing anything. He does not even realize that he is loving though others find him very loving.

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we are going to do Pūjā to Śhiva, Śhrī Śhiva.</b><br />
As you know, Śhrī Śhiva is the reflection of Sadāśhiva within us. I've already told about the reflection. Sadāśhiva is the God Almighty, the One who sees the play of Ādi Śhakti. But He is the Father who is watching each one of His Creation, or Her Creation.<br />
His support to Ādi Śhakti is entirely, fully, strengthening. There's no doubt in His mind about the capability of the Ādi Śhakti. But when He finds that in the play of Ādi Śhakti, the people or the world as such, try to disturb Her or spoil Her work, then He gets into His wrathful mood, and He destroys all such people, and maybe, He destroys the whole world.<br />
On one side He's wrathful, no doubt, on the other side, He is the Ocean of Compassion and Joy. That's why, when He's reflected within us, we get our Self-realization, we get the light of our Spirit, and we get into the Ocean of Joy."</font><br />

It is said about Śhrī Shivjī that He is very easy and very innocent. This is why it's very hard to know Him.<br />
<b>The work of Kuṇḍalinī is the work of Goddess. Goddess is the One who creates this universe and in the end She takes the form of Kuṇḍalinī and helps you to reach Śhrī Śhiva. When you worship Śhrī Śhiva you must remember that, `Did we have Śhrī Śhiva's qualities established within us or not?' That's why first of all we should understand the workings of Kuṇḍalinī.</b><br />
When Kuṇḍalinī is awakened, then foremost it heals your body to health because it is very important for the body to be healthy."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"When we worship Śhiva, we praise him. You are this you are that, you are that. When you worship Me also you praise Me, you are this. I am not aware of all that that you say. But you say all right, if you say so, it's all right. You are this you are that, the thousand names of Śhiva, thousand name of the Goddess, thousand name of Viṣhṇu. These are their names you are worshiping, what about you people, how many names you can have? Actually in the Pūjā when you take the names of these Śhaktis they also get awakened within, no doubt. After Pūjā you do feel that way but you don't utilize them. <b>So many people I've seen have come in the Pūjā and they have got that power within themselves, same powers. But by the time they are out, it's finished, it's gone.<br />
So, surrendering has another side: assumption. Assumption that I am a Sahaja Yogi and I can absorb all these powers within myself. So one side is surrendering. Why to surrender? To absorb. Automatically when you are surrendered you absorb. But once you have absorbed, then you should retain and assume within yourself, know that you have these powers.</b> There, where Sahaja Yogis fail more."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>When Śhiva closes His eyes, He is called a destroyer</b> (saṃhārak). <b>He only is the state and He only is the laya [extinction], because He can be a state, He can also be laya</b> [extinction]. I had told you about Śhiva's place in Kuṇḍalinī Śhāstra. In a man's heart, He always enlightens like the light of a lamp. Because of which the knowledge of right-wrong, discretion remains awakened, which goes on forbidding us, `Don't do this, this is wrong, this is unrighteous. This is wrong, this is deceitfulness, this is is greed, this is pride, this is jealousy, this is adharm, this is below the dignity of a man, this is not worthwhile.' But the independence that a man has, is used by him very badly and he disregards Śhiva.<br />
Śhiva drinks the poison of the whole world. Whatever amount of poison is settled in our heart, aversion towards others, evil, etc., very impure thoughts, our heart becomes poisonous, when Śhiva awakens within us, He drinks that poison. Śhiva's food, His drink is poison, whatever intoxicating things are there, the intoxicants, etc., all that is injurious to consciousness is consumed (prāśhan) by Śhiva."</font><br />

I forget everything else. I leave it in Your holy hands. You raise me up. I forget all that was in me before, just lift me up. You raise me up. Everything I have dropped out, no other desire but just lift me higher. Make me Your servant. The rest of it is not important. All the other manifestations of this desire are over. Now I am absolutely surrendered to You, my Spirit. Lift me higher and higher and higher. Away from all the thoughts and things that were not the Spirit. Make me complete Spirit.</b><br />
Forget all that was there. That elevation, that ascent becomes fast quick trip. A very fast thing. If you just try this every moment, anything that goes against the Spirit must be given up. And that Spirit is what? The pure desire.<br />
We have to be one with the Spirit, and all the rest is not important. You are in the beautiful Kingdom of God where all ugliness drops out like when the lotus opens out; all the mud drops out from it.<br />

Dear All,<br />
Today, on the Mahasamadhi Day of the complete Incarnation of Śhrī Ādi Śhakti Śhrī Mātājī Nirmalā Devī, with folded hands and bended knĪs and in complete love and awe and gratitude, we remember the Earthly life of our Divine Mother and all She has done for the evolution, redemption, and spiritual uplifting of mankind.<br />
<br />
It is a time to re-commit and re-dedicate ourselves to Her Visions expressed in Her teachings, to the work of Sahaja Yoga, and to the advancement of Vishwa Nirmala Dharma and of Sahaja Culture.  We pray to Śhrī Mātājī to help us to accomplish all Her Divine Visions. 
With all these in mind, we propose to watch the documentary"Vision"<br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we have the idea to do Saraswatī's Pūjā.</b> ...... I have seen that here people worship Mahākālī and Saraswatī, people worship Devī and people are simple natured. We should worship Saraswatī as well.<br />
Saraswatī's work is very great. <b>First, Mahāsaraswatī created the entire universe. The earth element is special in this. The earth element has been placed in such a way between the Sun and the Moon that any living work can easily happen on it.</b> From this living work, slowly and gradually human beings have been generated.<br />
But we should know our own great power. That power is what we call creation power, it's also called creativity.<br />
<b>This creation power is the blessing of Saraswatī by which many arts have been generated.</b> The evolution of art is due to the blessings of Saraswatī."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Today I thought we should have Mahāsaraswatī's Pūjā, would be a good idea. Because we did Mahālakṣhmī, let's have Mahāsaraswatī's.<br />
So, Mahāsaraswatī Principle is on the right side as I'd ... you all know. <b>First is the Brahmadeva's Principle, which is the Saraswatī Principle, and then this Mahāsaraswatī takes you to the Principle of Mahābrahmadeva called as Hiraṇyagarbha.<br />
Now this Hiraṇyagarbha Principle is very important for Sahaja Yogis.</b><br />
First of all, those who think too much or those who create too much without Realization, those who express themselves in poetry or in literature or in music, you can say, in paintings, in all kinds of arts; if they are not realized Souls, then they go to the left to the extreme or to the right."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"With the realization of the Ātmā, itself, the brain gets the incandescent of Śhrī Saraswatī and even the children who are weak in reading and writing start doing good work. After this, the growth of art begins. If one wants to develop art without Self-realization the art is not treated with respect [is unrecognized] and there is no name or sign of it and is eventually lost.<br />
So, first of all, <b>getting the Self-realization and then doing Saraswatī Pūjā is in itself a great thing</b>."</font><br />

<p style=" text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"Because Saraswatī had a <b>vīṇā in Her hand. And that vīṇā is the Primordial Instrument which She plays, like music. And the music penetrates into the heart.</b> You don't know how it goes into you and how it works out. <b>And that's how a person who is a Sahaja Yogi should permeate, like music, into everything.</b><br />
She has so many qualities as I told you which cannot be described in one lecture. But one of the greatest quality of Hers is: that She ends up into subtler things.<br />
Like the Mother Earth will end up into fragrance. Music will end up into melodies. Like that, whatever She creates ends up into something greater."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Saraswatī cleanses all that is impure in nature, while with our brain activity we are spoiling all that.<br />
All our brain activity goes against pure intelligence. And that's what one has to understand: that this pure intelligence is not to be soiled by our thinking. Our thinking can make us so bumptious, so ego-oriented, so impure that we can really eat the poison and say, `What wrong?' Just the opposite of Saraswatī. If Saraswatī will be in u ... is within us, <b>She gives us subuddhi, wisdom.<br />
And that's why, to worship Saraswatī, to worship Sūrya, we must have that clear vision as to what we have to be, what we are doing, what filth we are living in, what our mind is getting into. After all, we are here for emancipation and not for just pampering our ego and living with our filth that is with us.<br />
So, this Light has come within us and we should try to rise above our own mental filth, which is being created around us</b>."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"And as love will increase, your creativity will develop. So the basis of all creativity of Saraswatī is Love. If there is no love there's no creativity.<br />
It's even in the deeper sense, if you see, people who have created all the scientific things are also out of love to the masses, not for themselves. Nobody has produced anything for themselves. If they make something for themselves, it has to become for universal use, otherwise it has no meaning.<br />
......<br />
<b>So, all the activity on right-hand side of Saraswatī, basically has to end up in love: starts with love and ends up in love. Whichever does not end up in love, coils up and finishes off. It just disappears. So you can see that even matter which is not used for love just finishes off. The basis has to be love.</b>"</font><br />
