<font color="DarkRed">"<b>In India, Navarātri falls twice in a year. Once it is in the month of Chaitra as it is today.</b> On this day Devī is worshiped as Śhailaputrī, means the daughter of Himalaya. Devī has many other names also but first of all She incarnated as Śhailaputrī in the cold of Himalayas. She incarnated and whatever She was to do. She started there.<br />
..When Kuṇḍalinī rises and reaches the Heart chakra then it manifests and becomes more powerful and effective because Kuṇḍalinī is Jagadambā. In Sahaja Yoga, when Kuṇḍalinī is awakened it, settles in Heart chakra. It protects you and takes care of you nicely.<br />
No one could harm you at all if you keep the Mother in your heart. The power of the mother always protects the children. Whenever there is some danger, it is mentioned in medical terminology that the sternum bone starts shaking and antibodies that are present all around get alarmed. In Sahaja language, these antibodies are called gaṇas. They get ready to fight it out. She is the empress of these gaṇas. They follow her commands as there is no difference between Śhrī Gaṇeśha and Devī. Both are so identified.<br />
Gaṇeśha is Her Son and She is His Mother. In Sahaja Yoga, She protects all those who have awakened Śhrī Gaṇeśha in themselves. She protects them just like Her own children at every step. She supports them because She is the Mother and you are the Gaṇeśha. But the Gaṇeśha within you should be fully awakened and pure. If there is obstruction in this chakra, it should be removed."</font><br />

All our dates and festivals are decided according to it, particularly our festivals. We follow the Moon calendar whereas foreigners follow the Sun calendar. That is the reason that the dates of their festivals never get changed. But all our festivals depend on the position of the Moon. That is why their dates keep changing and all our festivals are celebrated on different dates."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is new year's day and the beginning of the Moon.</b> That is why this day is given so much significance. It is known as Guḍhī Pāḍavā. A flag is put on a stick and on it is put a small pitcher. This pitcher represents Kuṇḍalinī. It is taken as a symbol. The Śhālivāhanas were the devotees of the Devī [Goddess] and it is told that they used to offer shawl to the Goddess. In the beginning they were called Sāt[a]vāhans because they worshiped Seven Plexuses and this Sāt[a]vāhana was ultimately changed into Śhālivāhana. But the symbol of Śhālivāhana is the same. They put up a ‘guḍhī’ means a flag and a small pitcher is put on it as a symbol. This pitcher has a particular shape which represents Kuṇḍalinī. So they were the worshipers of Kuṇḍalinī and followed it. That is the reason they made this symbol in this way.<br />
All those who follow Kuṇḍalinī put up a guḍhī in their houses and also put a flag on it and thus it is indicated that they welcome Kuṇḍalinī and exhibit it in a special way."</font><br />

So the establishment of the Gaurī is taken place during these nine days.<br />
But Gaṇeśha has to be established before anything else.<br />
Though first Gaurī had to come, you can see that. Gaurī had to come first to establish Gaṇeśha."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Kuṇḍalinī is Gaurī, today is Gaurī Pūjan, Gaurī Pūjan in the month of Chaitra is special.</b> Means before installation of Gaṇapati we have installed Gaurī in the month of Chaitra. Gaurī who created Gaṇapati is the Gaurī from Chaitra and we all believe that.<br />
In the same way our Śhālivāhans have given it so much importance that Guḍhī Pāḍavā starts on the first day of Chaitra month, because Gaurī first is Śhakti, who started the work, to start any work first we worship Gaṇeśha, this is also done by Gaurī.<br />
Gaurī has put Gaṇeśh in the temporal world or universe so that the innocence which Gaṇeśh has should spread in the whole world. And before anyone else, She established Chaitanya in the form of Gaṇeśh for the whole world and spread it everywhere. Then we will do whatever is required but first is the Spirit, the Chaitanya. The world’s Kuṇḍalinī, Mother Gaurī has done this work.<br />
The importance of this day is that this is the beginning, creating Śhrī Gaṇeśh on Her on own, no contribution from Sadāśhiv, She has not yet met Sadāśhiv, so the Virgin Gaurī, She created Gaṇapati from Her Powers, because She is Śhakti Swarūpa, She can do anything. And that Gaṇapati is pure, holy, which is in the form of Chaitanya, was made."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>We have known about the importance of this day.

We should express and behave in a very sweet manner so that we do not hurt others. If at all we have to lay emphasis on some thing that should also be done very lovingly. You have to think as to how to speak with others. It’s a routine for Me. Such and such person is coming, how shall I talk to him and make him understand? When we see this love all around, it fills our heart. Exchange this love with others and talk to them sweetly. Sahaja Yogis should not be angry with anyone. Meet people very affectionately. You should be pure within and this purity of heart should be visible. There should be no anger and hatred. Only then people will appreciate you. Now you are all self-realized and I am telling you, how your personality should become magnetic. I hope you follow this advice and look within with love, not with hatred. You will be able to see your powers and you will become a sāttvik [pure] person and Sahaja Yoga will spread all around.

And that the Ocean itself is going to strengthen them and look after them. It’s the Ocean that is going to nourish them. And the same Ocean is going to guide them. So the connection between a drop and an Ocean has to be fully established. So the limitations of a drop have to be absolutely dissolved into the greatness of the Ocean.<br />
With care and with nice things to say we can improve the depth of the collectivity, and with sincere desire to be collective. The desire to be collective has to be very sincere. So, this expanse of your being will start.<br />
The first thing is needed: a sincerity to yourself."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, the great day of Holikā Dahana</b>, where the symbolism of this occasion is that the satanic forces were burnt by the innocence of Prahlāda. And that is what we have to remember, that when the Sahaja Yogis take to innocence and complete dependence on to their vibratory awareness, which is the indication of God’s Manifestation through them, they are completely protected, and even a satanic person like Holikā could not burn him [them].<br />
And this is the day today, we have to recognize that, as Sahaja Yogis, we stand no dangers in life. We are fearless people, but we are humble people, loving people, and anxious to save as many as possible. To raise the whole humanity into another awareness, in the process of your evolution, you have to achieve ghaṭ, for which you have to work hard."</font><br />

<font size="+0"><b>1983-0328 Message (Holikā Dahana), New Delhi, India</b></font>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkGreen">"Śhrī Rāma incarnated before Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. He was Maryādā Puruṣhottama and as such lived a very austere life. As a result of the austerities practiced by the King Himself, the whole society turned sober and serious. The element of joy and gaiety was completely missing. In Dwāpara Yuga, when Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa incarnated, He wanted to put an end to this extreme seriousness prevalent in the society. He thought of having a festival in which everyone could laugh heartily and have fun and joy. So the festival of color Holī, was started with this purpose. People, however, took undue liberties and misused the festival to the extent of defaming it. I had also to tell that “I do not play Holī at all.”<br />
The myth behind it is that there was a demoness named Holikā. She was the sister of Hiraṇyakaśhipu, the father of Prahlāda. Since Prahlāda was the devotee of Lord Viṣhṇu, his father, the demon king, used to harass and trouble him. Hiraṇyakaśhipu wanted to kill Prahlāda. Holikā had the boon that fire won’t burn her. Hiraṇyakaśhipu asked Holikā to take the boy Prahlāda in her lap and sit on the burning pyre, thinking that she could not be burnt. But to his surprise Holikā was burnt to ashes and no harm done to the child devotee of Śhrī Viṣhṇu! It was a significant incident which proved that it is sin to be cruel, arrogant and aggressive. Despite her boon, Holikā was burnt down and no harm done to the innocent child – devotee!<br />
Such is the myth and traditionally we burn Holī every year. There lies a lot of truthfulness in all our traditions. We have to understand that misdeeds, cruelties and troubling others are evil tendencies. Right-sided people develop these devilish traits in them. We should not allow such thoughts to dominate our brains and should give no significance to them. We should love all. It is very important to understand otherwise we shall all be demonic like Holikā. Now right-sided people develop this problem. It is a big lesson for them. No harm was done to the innocent child Prahlāda. God Almighty saved him, but this demonic woman, who got a boon as a result of her severe penance was reduced to ashes. One should understand that all these demonic tendencies are destructive. We should give them up and be generous and loving towards all. Quarreling and fighting with each other are not virtues. These are demonic tendencies.<br />
We should not take to these evil traits, we are Sahaja Yogis. <b>We are special people, we have incarnated to change this world, to transform it completely. We should put our attention on that. We are very highly placed, higher than all others. We have to save this world from falling to these tendencies.</b> These are much in vogue these days. It is unworthy to say these abhorrent things and to be cruel and dominate others. It is unnecessary in Sahaja Yoga.<br />
You are powerful enough. You have such powers within you that if someone endeavors to trouble you, you will be protected like Prahlāda. No one could destroy you. You are so much protected! No such thing could destroy you."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>As you know, on the Day of Holī, Holikā was burnt.</b> Agni [God of Fire] had a very big blessing and task, because Agni Devatā had given Holikā a boon that in any circumstance, she will not burn, that death could come to her in any form, but not by fire. And after giving this boon, he regretted a lot because she took Prahlād in her lap and sat in the fire. And Agni Devatā had a big dilemma, that ``I have given this promise to her, that I will not burn her and how can I fulfill this promise? <b>And Prahlād, is Himself innocence personified, He is Himself an Incarnation of Śhrī Gaṇeśha</b> and how can I burn Him? Nobody can burn Him. And He is also beyond my powers. He is formed from my power." So he thought, ``What is this ego? that in front of such a Great Power what can I talk about my power? I have no such power which can face Him. His Power is so great that I cannot burn Him whatsoever I may try. But at this time I have a very big dilemma in front of me.""</font><br />

It’s a very great privilege for all of us to understand about Śhrī Mahādeva. Unless and until you have got your Self-realization you cannot understand what is the great personality, the character, and the Powers of Śhrī Mahādeva.<br />
Is not easy to conceive, also to reach the depth, of His greatness unless and until we are humble. We have to be very humble to reach at the Lotus Feet of Śhrī Mahādeva. As you have seen that one has to cross even the Sahasrāra to be at the Lotus Feet of this great personality. He is beyond, beyond all our conception, but He resides in our hearts as the Spirit, and is reflected very well when you get your Realization."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"I have told you about the origin before.<br />
<b>Because on the Day of Mahāśhivarātri, when there is a talk about Śhivjī, then it has to begin with origin.<br />
How much He is Primordial, means when there is a first manifestation of form of God Almighty.</b><br />
He is called as Sadāśhiva when He is enlightened from Brahma.<br />
That is why the one who is Śhivjī is called as Ādi [Primordial].<br />
You see, before the complete manifestation of any tree its seed has to be seen first and that is why it has to be called ‘Bīj Swarūpa’ – form of the seed.<br />
That is why the glory of Śhiva is very important.<br />
After that, after His manifestation, the power within Him gets Her form and is called as Ādi Śhakti."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we are going to worship Śhiva Tattwa within us, Principle of Śhiva.</b><br />
For all Sahaja Yogis it’s very important, for [as] Śhiva is the ultimate we have to achieve. Śhiva is represented in our Spirit, so to become Śhiva is the ultimate aim of everything else. The rest of it is all created, like Viṣhṇu Tattwa and Brahmadeva, just to create human beings, to evolve them, and then ultimately lead them to Śhiva. That’s the Ultimate.<br />
But human beings get so involved into the Brahmadeva’s Tattwas that even to get into Viṣhṇu Tattwa is difficult. They get into involved into the five elements which have created us. That is the outermost being within us. All the chakras have the outermost, we can say, the ... just the vessel. But the desire to be the Spirit is of primal importance in Sahaj Yog."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"We have all assembled here to worship Lord Śhiva. <b>Śhiva Pūjā is a very great and special Pūjā. The ultimate aim of human beings is to attain that Śhiva Tattwa.</b> Śhiva Tattwa is beyond the brain. It cannot be known through the brain. Till you have got your Self-realization you cannot know the Self, Ātmā or the Śhiva Tattwa.<br /> 
Too much falsehood, myth, and blind faith has taken place in the name of Lord Śhiva. Till a person is self-realized he cannot know Lord Śhiva because his nature is such that to know him, a person has first to attain that height where all the great virtues themselves enshrine within.<br /> 
...... These Śhaktis reside within us through the Śhiva Tattwa. To attain the Śhiva Tattwa Self-realization is essential. Kuṇḍalinī is the Śhakti and the chakras are the steps. One has to ascend all the steps to attain the Śhiva Tattwa. This is the revelation of all the Gods and Deities. This is their job and they are completely absorbed in it. Unlike human beings, they do not think about themselves or their rank, etc. They are a part and parcel of Lord Śhiva. To facilitate human ascent to the Śhiva Tattwa is their nature.<br /> 
They need not be lectured or told anything, they are completely submerged in their task. They work in karma. They do not think they are doing anything. They are thoughtless and unmindful for their powers, like sugar gives sweetness to food, but is unaware that it is sweet. Similarly, when Sahaja Yogis act they are not aware of the Śhakti within which is behind their actions. If the consciousness comes that I am the doer, I am a leader, etc. then you are not a Sahaja Yogi. Through Sahaja Yoga one becomes a karmi. He keeps performing without even remembering that he is doing anything. He does not even realize that he is loving though others find him very loving."</font><br />

Also He is the Ocean of Knowledge, so those who get self-realized get the Knowledge of the Divine, which is very subtle, permeating into every atom and molecule, the Power of this Knowledge is there. His style is such that, in his compassion, He forgives even very cruel rākṣhasas, if they dedicate themselves to Him.

Śhrī Ādi Śhakti has created all these planets, worlds, rivers and seas, humans, animals, and plants, in the eternal play of creation - only to be pleasing to You. And in complete joy, and complete detachment, You witness it all. She did all of this out of great kindness and mercy so that we, Your bhaktas, could find You again and again in the depths of our being.</b><br />
O Lord, You are the Absolute, the Fundamental Principle, the Transcendent and Unchanging Truth. You have neither beginning nor end. You are the very origin of the Self, You are both formless and omnipresent in every form. We worship You as the first syllable Auṃ. Verily You are the Creator and the Preserver. You are the Source of all knowledge. All sublime Arts and aesthetics flow from You.<br />
<b>Salutations to The Eternal Yogi, whose pale skin has the dazzling brilliance of ten million suns. You are eternally and blissfully in meditation. You reside in the snowy white peaks of Mount Kailasha, and You reside in our heart chakra; Your love sustaining each particle of creation. Verily You are the embodiment of innocence, utterly beautiful to behold.  Salutations to The Ascetic One, detached from all worldly comforts, whose radiant form is smeared with ashes. The skin of a fierce and majestic tiger adorns You. Your trident is poised to destroy all evils. And the rhythmic drum beat of Your damaru controls the beating hearts of each living soul.</b><br />
Verify You are Śhrī Neelkant whose throat has turned blue from consuming all the poisons of this entire world. You are the one who defeats the seven enemies of the soul, thus ending all worldly desires and delusions. You wear a rosary of holy Rudraksha seeds said to be made from Thine own tears of compassion. Salutations to Trilochana whose Lotus Eyes brim with love.<br />
<b>To meditate upon You is to drop into the ocean of Sachchidānanda, so that the meditating Saints and Sages of all times sing Your glories. Salutations to the One with disheveled and matted locks that billow in the mountain breezes carrying forth Thy divine fragrance; for verily You are the Lord of the Wind. You are our life breath and our lifeline. The shining crescent moon is worn as a jewel in the midnight black of Your hair, and You wear a necklace of glittering stars. From the sacred crown of Your topknot, the River Gaṅgā cascades in a joyful, purifying stream into our upturned palms as Cool Vibrations.</b><br />
We praise You as Śhrī Paśhupati, Lord and protector of animals. Your faithful servant Nandi, the bull calf, is Your Vāhana.  All creatures great and small seek Thy refuge, even those animals most feared by man. In Thy benevolence, You offer even the serpents the warmth of Your body to protect them from the icy chill of the Himalayas. Verily You are Śhrī Nnāgabhūṣhaṇa wearing a garland of snakes in three coils, representing the primordial Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
<b>We praise the One who stands on one foot, poised beyond and above the three worlds. The wise beings of all kalpas, lokas and yugas, who only exist by Your will, bow down in great thankfulness and ask for forgiveness at Your Lotus Feet. We worship Lord Naṭarāj whose cosmic Tāṇḍava Dance, in the never-ending cycle of time, eventually brings the whole universe to an end.  And we pull our ears now, we seek forgiveness for any mistakes we may make in this Pūjā. We pray that Śhrī Gaṇeśha and all the deities be present. We ask forgiveness for our attention straying from the blissful realm of spirit. And pray, please remove all ignorance, egoism, attachments, and delusions, that hinder our spiritual growth as Sahaja Yogis. Oh, Mahādeva, O Giver of Boons, please bestow auspiciousness, wisdom, and peace upon us all, may we be completely drenched by the pure joy of Bhakti.</b></font><br />

Saraswatī’s work is very great. First, Mahāsaraswatī created the entire universe.<br />
The earth element is special in this. The earth element has been placed in such a way between the Sun and the Moon that any living work can easily happen on it.<br />
From this living work, slowly and gradually human beings have been generated.<br />
But we should know our own great power.<br />
That power is what we call creation power, it’s also called creativity.<br />
This creation power is the blessing of Saraswatī by which many arts have been generated. The evolution of art is due to the blessings of Saraswatī."</font><br />

She also functions as the thinking power of the Primordial Being, and this process generates the Cosmic Ego (Ādi Ahaṅkāra). The channel carrying this power is the Ādi Piṅgalā Nāḍī, and it expresses the Primordial Preconscious Mind (Ādi Chitta).

So we must know what are in the books, means in the Scriptures.

Kids are of two types: one loves studying and the other don’t enjoy studying. Some kids have less brain and others have more.<br />
<b>Brain is also the gift of Saraswatī but the Ātmā gives us wisdom. Whatever knowledge you get from your brains, until you weigh it on your wisdom, then that knowledge becomes harmful.</b><br />
...... <b>With the realization of the Ātmā, itself, the brain gets the incandescent of Śhrī Saraswatī</b>, and even the children who are weak in reading and writing start doing good work. After this, the growth of art begins.<br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Śhrī Gaṇeśha was made out of the, they say, it is a beautiful poetic way of saying it, out of the mud that was covering the Mother Pārvatī</b> or you can say the Gaurī at that time. Because She was not married in the sense that She was a virgin just finished her marriage and She was to meet her husband and this virgin wanted to have a bath before meeting her husband, so She cleanses her hands properly and makes this Deity of Śhrī Gaṇeśha which is bestowed on this center. If you really develop your proper insight through meditation you can see Śhrī Gaṇeśha settled down there very clearly.<br />
<b>Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the Embodiment of Innocence</b> and that’s why He is a child, that’s why His head is that of an elephant because an elephant being an animal doesn’t grow into ego and superego like human beings do. That’s why He is a child. <b>He is the Embodiment of Childhood</b> and He incarnated on this Earth once which is described in Devī Bhāgavat[am] if you read as Mahāviṣhṇu."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is a very important day for all of us Sahaja Yogis because today Shrī Gaṇesha was born.</b> Shrī Gaṇesha is whom we worship and because of whom we got our realization. However much you may remember Him, until you do not know His special qualities, you cannot attain Him. His special quality is that He is the embodiment of purity (shuddha swarūp) and complete Master of the Universe. He is the incarnation of the Supreme, of Brahman.<br />
By coming into this world He has created music (sangeet), rhythm (tāl), and notes (sur). By His Grace, only people become one with music (talleen)(engrossed). A small boy who came into the world and did such great work! He has given so many things to everyone and even today He is active. Shrī Gaṇesha’s Pūjā, no matter how much you do it, it is not enough. A lot of people say we don’t see Shrī Gaṇesha, even after worshipping Him so much, we do not attain Him."</font><br />

The first blessing of Śhrī Gaṇeśha, which is, I think is the highest, is the wisdom, that we learn what is good for us and what is bad for us, what is constructive and what is destructive, what should we do to achieve our Self-realization.

By taking His name alone any disease or any pain will disappear. He is eternal. He is always present within us, when you get your Realization, you can feel Him.
And if you are not realized, you cannot understand Him. That is why people get misled and do wrong things. But with Śhrī Gaṇeśha’s blessings, you can do so many things and neither you will feel greedy, nor will you have any problems. Because He does all the work for you."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"For Sahaj Yogis, it is very important, because if say, there’s a cloth or a sāṛī which is blown off by the wind, even if you can hold it on one corner, you can hold it, and after some time the whole thing can subside.<br />
And this is what has to happen actually to the world, when Sahaj Yogis will hold the sāṛī, we can call, or this Universe with their wisdom and firm faith in Sahaja Yoga.
Otherwise, they can be blown off also. If they are not rightly placed, if they are not grounded, if they are not fixed to their own enlightened faith of Sahaja Yoga,<br />
they can be blown off with this wind which is there to torture the whole world, to destroy the whole world.<br />
<b>So the responsibility of Sahaja Yogis is very important that their Gaṇeśh Principle should be all right.<br />
If it is not all right, then the whole of Sahaja Yoga movement can collapse.<br />
For ladies and for men, I have to make a humble request: that they should try to put their Śhrī Gaṇeśh in a very respectable position in their lifestyle.<br />
That should be the highest, the most important, and also every day to be remembered that we are very much blessed by Śhrī Gaṇeśh to get your Self-realization.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are celebrating here a special day called Makar Saṅkrānt.</b> For the information of the foreign Sahaja Yogis, I will explain to you what it means.<br />
......<br />
It means the day, today is the day the Sun crosses over from the Tropic of Capricorn to the Tropic of Cancer. It is a very big day for us because, now during the summertime we have the harvest, and we look forward to the rain and so many things that happen in every country. The Sun falls at right angles in this country during the summer season and so we welcome the Sun. We eat something -- that you must have eaten already -- what we call as tīḷ and jaggery. It is to prepare your body and your mind to give it sufficiency to receive the Sun. Because if you are living in the cool season, then all your body, mind becomes lethargic and you become also sometimes very lazy about things in the sense, that the day is so small, that you cannot achieve many results. So the body has become cold as we call it. We take these things, which give us heat so body is prepared to receive the heat of the Sun to welcome."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"The meaning of Makar Saṅkrānti is saṅkramaṇ, that is, the day that brings about some change. <b>On this day the Sun starts its movement toward the Northern Hemisphere. In India, all the festivals are according to the position of the Moon. That’s why their dates are different in different years. Makar Saṅkrānti is based on the position of the Sun and that is the reason this festival is celebrated every year on fourteenth January.</b><br />
Makar Saṅkrānti indicates the day when the Sun becomes warmer. The heat of the Sun is benevolent for the human race. It is because of this heat that we can walk, we can talk. The heat of the Sun makes a human being angry. This is the reason why we take jaggery on this day so that we talk sweetly. The heat of the Sun is responsible for all the vegetation and wealth of the Earth. On this day we offer fruits and vegetables to the Devī and receive Her blessings. With the blessings of Ādi Śhakti the earth element cools down and the human race progresses."</font><br />

You have to think what is your mind doing. There are many people who are waiting to come in Sahaja Yoga.<br />

The Guru of all the Gurus -- Ādi Guru Śhrī Dattā Mahārāja. I bow to Him, He is My Guru also. He has taught Me quite enough on Sahaja Yoga all through My many births. And because of that only I have been able to do some work in this birth also, continuing to do.<br />

<font color="DarkRed">"All your ancient Scriptures are singing praise of the Incarnations as Gurus. Dattātreya, the three fold innocence that guides the Path of Dharma. There are Ten basic Dharmas of human beings. They must be guarded, respected and are to be identified with Tādātmya.<br />
<b>There is no compromise but human intelligence gives ideas by which human societies have gone into horrible conditions.</b> They play of mind takes us to sin and we become insensitive to sin.<br />
<b>Today I want you to resolve that you all will become absolutely dhārmik. It is hard to be a dhārmik. The society and the environment forces you to be adhārmik. You are born in innocence and later you go on compromising and accepting adhārmik patterns as normal.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="DarkGreen">"And this G... Dattātreya is the One who is comprising all these forces: say, the existence force and the evolutionary force and the creative force, all of them, in Its innocence.<br />
I don't know if you understand it, but there is a story about Them is, that there are Three Deities, which belong to these Three Forces: the left one is Śhiva's Force, then the right one is Brahmadeva's Force, and the center one is Viṣhṇu's Force."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"All these people can feel it within themselves: is the religion in their stomachs, they can feel it. <b>They can find out where is the religion. Because, I say, there, religion in the stomach is looked after by the Deities of Primordial Master whom we call as Dattātreya, in the Sanskrit language.<br />
But does't mean Hinduism. It doesn't mean Hinduism at all. But it is called as Dattātreya in the Sanskrit language, in English is Primordial Master.</b><br />
He is the same who incarnated on this earth: as Moses, as Abraham, and, say, incarnated as Muhammad Sāhab, as Rāja Janaka, as Nāṇaka, and also as Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth. Can you believe that Muhammad Sāhab is the same as our Nāṇak?<br />
......<br />
...... the living religion is within us ...... So your religion automatically awakens and you just don't have to bother. Nobody has to tell you ......<br />
So this is a religion that is within you which is enlightened through Kuṇḍalinī and then it works out. But it is an Absolute Religion in the sense that you all feel the same thing. If you feel one finger the other is also going to feel the same thing."</font><br />

<font color="DarkGreen">"Today is the day of Guru Pūrṇimā. It is a Full Moon Day. That's why ... it is called as Pūrṇimā. The guru has to be like a Full Moon. Means completely grown, completely matured.<br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Dattātreya is the innocence of all these Three Powers.<br />
And this Guru uh was the One whose ... who then had a big tradition of Gurus.</b><br />
In the same tradition we had many Gurus in our country and specially in the area near Bombay [Mumbai], which is called as Maharashtra.<br />
They came as Nāth. <b>They were called as Nāth.</b> So the first one was Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], then Dattātreya, then Macchindranāth, then Gorakhnāth, like that a tradition of these Gurus came.<br />
But all their knowledge was kept as a guarded secret. It was a Gupta Vidyā, is absolutely guarded secret, a secret knowledge about Kuṇḍalinī. They never talked about it; they never told about it. Because they thought that, 'Just now let us experiment with it fully and then we will give some idea about it to people.'<br />
But as you see everywhere it happens, even it happens with us here sometimes that we get people who do not get Realization or are half-baked and they cannot rise much higher. Then they get, sort of you see, very angry or sometimes they take this half-baked knowledge and start working on it and they go absolutely wrong on this side or that side."</font><br />
