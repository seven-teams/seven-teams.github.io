<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we are worshiping Ādi Śhakti.</b><br />
I think this is the most important Pūjā, because it is the Power of Ādi Śhakti that has given you Self-realization, that has given you the Truth, that has given you the Power of Compassion and Love.<br />
That’s the power that separated from Sadāśhiva. And this Power wanted Herself to create this Complete Universe: universes after universes. She’s creating and loving. With Her love, She did this Great Creation, Creation of this world also.<br />
This is a specially selected planet, which was very beautifully brought in the center, between the Sun and the Moon, for the creation of, ultimately, the human beings."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we are all going to worship Me, first time. It has been always the Pūjā of [an] aspect of Me or a part of Me.</b><br />
Now, one has to know very clearly what is Ādi Śhakti. As we say, is the Pure Desire of God Almighty, of Sadāśhiva. But what is the pure Desire of God Almighty?<br />
If you see your own desires, come out of what? Not out of the Divine Love but out of carnal love, out of material love, of out of power love. Behind all these desires there is love.<br /> 
If you do not love something you will not desire it. So, these mundane types of love that you have, for which we spend so much of our time uselessly, actually they do not give you satisfaction, because that is not true love that you have. Just infatuation for the time being, and then you just get fed up with it, and from there you jump to another thing, to another thing, to another thing. So Ādi Śhakti is the Embodiment of God's Divine Love, is God's Pure Love, and in His Love what did He desire? He desired that He should create human beings, who would be very obedient, would be sublime, would be like angels. And that was His idea: to create Adam and Eve. "</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So, today we have gathered here to worship Buddha.</b><br />
Lord Buddha, as you know, was Gautama: the One who was born in a royal family.<br />
And then, He became an ascetic. Because He was very much hurt to see three types of problems from which human beings suffer. And He came to [the] conclusion: ‘All these three types of problems are because we have desires.’ So He said that, “If you become desireless, then there will be no problem for you.”<br />
So He studied Vedas, He studied Upaniṣhadas, He studies [studied] all kinds of things, He went to many Saints and many people, [but] He could not get His Realization.<br />
Actually, He was an Incarnation.
The Incarnation also has to reach a point of Realization in a different way. Like the whole potential has to open out. But the Incarnation has tremendous potential. And that expresses itself once the door is opened outward."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we have decided to celebrate the Buddha Jayanti, it's the day of Buddha's birthday.</b> In the whole map of time, Buddha came to this Earth at a time when it was so important for Him to come. That time, especially in India, we had two types of people: one, who were very ritualistic, trying to be extremely strict and disciplined; and the another were the people who were too much conditioned and were full of so-called devotion to God. So these two types of people were occupying the area of seekers. So it was necessary to neutralize these two styles of seekings. "</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now Buddha was one of the very Great Incarnations in the sense that He was the son, one of the sons of Rāma who incarnated on this earth, Buddha, to occupy the highest life on this earth.</b> So He had to take saṃnyāsa because without that He could not show that. But there was no need for anybody else to take saṃnyāsa. But in His case mistakes, I mean, why there were some mistakes about things, because when He tried all these tricks of saṃnyāsa, going here and there He never realized that this is all not needed. He was so tired and fagged out, that suddenly, spontaneous, the Primordial Mother Herself gave Him the Realization because He was so tired."</font><br />

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So the people who today are worshiping Buddha should know that His Message of Truth, which we know through our right side, through our attention, must be applied to ourselves, first of all.</b><br />
...... The problem with Sahaja Yogis sometimes is that they don’t know the importance of what they are, they are not aware. If their ego was correct, in that ahaṅkāra, ego, the essence of it is aham-bhāva, is that, ‘I am a Sahaja Yogi.’ I am a Sahaja Yogi.’ Now keep the point of honesty with it. ‘Honestly, I’m a Sahaja Yogi and I’m a follower of a religion, which is a Universal Religion, which is innately built myself. There’s no hanky panky about it. Is my experience, and I believe in it fully, and is innately within myself.’ This is the aham-bhāva. I don’t know what is it in the English language, is could be ‘I’-ness, ‘I’-ness.<br />
Then, “I am on this Earth now, this life is for the work of God. And for that, I have to be a pure person because I belong to Vishwa Nirmal Dharm. I have to be pure. I have to achieve my purity: through meditation through every way watching myself, ‘I have to be a pure person.’ And if I am a Sahaja Yogi, if I am united with that All-pervading Power of Love, I should be the medium to give that love to others and compassion. I have no time for other things. Other things are of no value. My attention has to be pure. My life has to be pure."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So, this special thing is that we are worshiping a Deity on the right Āgñyā which makes you think too much, first of all, and also it makes you aggressive, and also it makes you a very right-sided.</b> By this worship, you will become very mild, very gentle, very beautiful people and you’ll be able to see things much more clearly.<br />
Now, this right side gives you a kind of a ego which troubles everyone, but you could never feel the trouble till you get into a very serious state. It gives you the overactivity of the brain and conscious mind works too hard. For that you are, you are not very hard-working people, but you can see, first of all, that your mind is more active than your body. So, this Āgñyā chakra has to be controlled by Buddha, and that’s why we do Pūjā today."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is a very great day, I must say, to celebrate Sahasrāra, the Pūjā of Sahasrāra.</b><br />
It’s a very unique thing that has happened, that your Sahasrāras were opened out.<br />
......<br /> 
So it’s a very great day because collectively this Sahasrāra has been opened. Every one of you have got it. Also all over the world, you have many people who have got their Sahasrāras open. Of course, we need many more for them to understand what is this great event of such a collective opening of Sahasrāra.<br />
Some have grown very much, after getting their Realization, very much. They have understood Sahaja Yoga very well, and they have developed their depth, and their consciousness is really a great awareness of Oneness with the Divine.<br />
<b>To be one with the Divine is the greatest blessing for human beings.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So this Sahasrāra Day or, we can say, on the day the Sahasrāra was opened out, is a very important one, it’s very subtle.</b> We just know about the Kuṇḍalinī, that She’s coiled up in three and a half, and She’s lying in the triangular bone known as sacrum. But we don’t know what She works, how She works, what happens to us. She rises in six centers and breaks the seventh ... I should say She breaks the sixth center because Gaṇeśha’s center doesn’t play any role. So when She breaks the sixth center, which is the
Sahasrāra, then She connects you to the All-pervading Power of Divine Love.<br />
But what is this Divine Love? What does this do? It is the Energy of the Mother. We can say it is the Energy of Ādi Śhakti, which is all over, works through vibrations. But what are these vibrations? It’s a very subtle energy that starts flowing through your Sahasrāra. All the thousand petals of the Sahasrāra get slowly enlightened and it starts flowing throughout your body, throughout your hands, feet, throughout your body. And the more you are ... I mean your attention is, on the Sahasrāra, the more it works faster."</font><br />

Sahasrāra was definitely opened and Mother had to do it, because formerly those people who came on this Earth tried to teach people about dharma, to bring them to the central path, to the straightforward path of ascent. They tried everything, whatever way They thought was good for a particular community, particular area, particular country. They talked about it and lots of books came out of it, but instead of all these books creating people of religious, spiritual and a united nature, created people who were all against each other."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So, opening Sahasrāra was the most important part of the evolutionary process.</b> All the evolution process brought human beings to what level? We had wars, we had all kinds of silly programs by which we really ruined the so many countries, so many people.<br />
Now, when you are one with that All-pervading Power – it’s a pure power, it’s a nirmal power, absolutely pure power – that gives you complete sense and complete understanding as to how you should move, how you should live and what you should have. This is what is Self-realization, they say."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"It’s very gratifying to see so many Sahaja Yogis have come to celebrate the Sahasrāra Day.<br />
Without breaking the Sahasrāra, we could not have achieved the ascent en masse. But the Sahasrāra which is the brain has gone into too much complications in the West. And the thoughts are very much twisted, one upon the other. To keep Sahasrāra open should be very easy if the Western brains could understand and be aware about your Mother.<br />
<b>When your Mother is the Deity of Sahasrāra, the only way to be able to keep the Sahasrāra open has to be complete surrendering.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is a unique combination of Mother’s Day in many countries and Sahasrār Day for Sahaj Yogis. I think this is the most important day in the history of human evolution</b> because all other events, Incarnations and ventures in the spiritual atmosphere have been of no avail. On the contrary, they have gone into a kind of a cocoon which has no door, banging themselves against the walls, creating problems out of something very auspicious and extremely, beautifully spiritual.<br />
Is not possible to find faults with the Incarnations in whose names all the religions came in. But this cocoon is the Mahāmāyā, I think, cocoon is the one which is ignorance. We can say that Māyā ... Mahāmāyā does not create it. This cocoon is created by the basic ignorance of human beings and their misidentifications."</font><br />

So far, the blessings of God came to human beings individually as Grace and they received their Self-realization individually, one by one. And the method for individual Realization was just the opposite of the collective. First, they had to establish their dharma, cleanse themselves fully, desiring all the time for their salvation, putting their attention to their salvation, as you call it Īśhwarapraṇidhān [desire for God], thinking of God, asking for His Grace and acting in a scrupulous, dhārmik ways to keep themselves pure. They had to control their mind, control their desires, control their action in such a manner that they absolutely kept to the center path.

<font color="red">"<b>It's a great day for all of us, the seekers, that the last work of the Divine, of opening the last center in the Great Primordial Being, was done on the fifth of May 1970. It is the greatest event of all the spiritual happenings of the Universe.</b> It was done with very great care and great adjustments.<br />
It is not in the limits of human understanding, how things are worked in the heavens. It is your fortune and God's Love that has worked out this wondrous miracle. Without this happening, there could not have been a possibility to give [en] masse Realization to people. One could have done it for one or two persons here and there, but to give such a masse awakening could not have been possible.<br />
As you know, in the Sahasrāra there are the seats of the seven main chakras. There are 1,000 nāḍīs or, as they call it, flames, and they all have each Sixteen Thousand Powers. Every nāḍī deals with a particular type of a person and, with the permutations and combinations of all these nāḍīs, human beings are looked after.<br />
As soon as Sahasrāra was opened, the whole atmosphere was filled with tremendous Chaitanya [vibrations]. And there was tremendous light in the sky. And the whole thing came on this Earth as if a torrential rain, or a waterfall, with such a tremendous force, as if I was unaware and got stupefied. The happening was so unexpected and so tremendous that I was stunned and I became completely silent at its grandeur. I saw the Primordial Kuṇḍalinī rising like a big furnace. And the furnace was very silent but burning uh appearance it had. As if you heat up some metal and it has many colors, in the same way, the Kuṇḍalinī showed up like a huge furnace, say of a, you can say, of a furnace which is like a tunnel, where you see these plants you have for uh coal burning to create electricity. And it stretched like a telescope one after another, it came out, tchue, tchue, tchue, like that. And the Deities came and sat on their Seats, on their Golden Seats, and then They lifted the whole of the head, like a big dome, and opened it. And then this torrential rain completely drenched Me, and I started seeing all that and got lost into the joy. It was like an artist seeing its own creation fulfilled, I felt the joy of great fulfillment."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"As a result of Sahasrāra being opened out, one thing: the illusions have vanished. What you call in Sanskrit is bhrānti. Illusions have vanished. You should have no illusion as to the existence of God Almighty, the Power of His Will and the Truth about Sahaja Yoga. You should have no doubts at all! Minimum of minimum should be like that.<br />
But while using this Power, you should be aware that this Power is given to you because you are capable of handling it. This is the Highest Power that you could think of.<br />
Take any governor, take any minister, anyone, they can be removed tomorrow. They can become corrupt. They can become absolutely devoid of any knowledge of their own powers. There are many people who just get elected without knowing what they have to do.<br />
<b>So this is not just a conversion of people, is not only even transformation, but it is a new fashioning of a new human being which has come forward and which is capable of carrying the Will of God further.</b><br />
So, as a result of your Realization, what you have got?<br />
The first thing that has happened is that your illusions have gone. You should have no illusions about God Almighty, His Will, and that He is omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient. All His omnipotence has done this work.<br />
And, as Collective Consciousness, you should also know that you are also omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient. Omniscient is the thing, that He sees everything, knows everything. Part of it, that Power, is also within you. So, to prove His omnipresence, you have to be all the time aware that you are Sahaja Yogis.<br />
So the Omnipotent God who is everywhere, who has done all this, the Will of God that has worked it out, has to work through you people. And you have to be very strong, very sensible, very wise, also very effective people. The more effective you become the more energy you'll get.<br />
But still I feel that the Sahaja Yogis are more, not taking the responsibility of understanding that they have to represent this God Almighty who is omnipresent, omniscient, who knows everything, who sees everything and who is potent, means Almighty.<br />
If you understand that this is what has happened after opening the Sahasrāra, that you have now got the Power which has these three qualities in it."</font><br />

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Sahasrāra is your awareness. When it is enlightened you get into the technique of the Divine.</b><br />
Now there are two techniques: the technique of the Divine, and the technique that you follow. You cannot act as Divine, but you can use the Divine Power and maneuver it.<br />
For example, Divine looks after all the universal happenings. Every minutest particle is controlled by Divine.<br />
When your Sahasrāra opens out and your Kuṇḍalinī touches the fontanel bone, sort of a igniting force is ready in your Sahasrāra, and as soon as the fontanel bone area opens up through the Brahmarandhra, the Grace of your Spirit ignites that igniting force and your nāḍīs get enlightened. Not all of them, quite a lot of them; not all the length, but quite the peripheries. That's how you get your enlightenment."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Had a very nice Pūjā in Pune which I had to perform on the thirteenth because it is the date called <b>Akṣhaya Tṛitīya, means un-destructible [indestructible] third day of the Moon. That's actually nobody knew, but it is the Pūjā of the Kuṇḍalinī.</b> That day everybody felt very, very clear. Very clear. Pūjā was hardly for about half an hour, the real Pūjā of the Kuṇḍalinī. But everybody felt extremely clear and beautiful.<br />
So, that sort of Pūjā we should do tomorrow also, if possible, so that we'll have the feelings of Sahasrāra completely opened out because even if Sahasrāra is opened, the rest of the chakras, if they are caught up then you have problems. It's better to clear out all the chakras and then the Sahasrāra. So, tomorrow we'll do the Pūjā in that fashion and I hope it will work out very well for all of you."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"So first, your vibrations must improve, to receive. If the reception is not good what’s the use of any Pūjā or projection? So first of all we, sort of, prepare our instrument or prepare our projecting instrument.<br />
<b>That preparation is done by praying to different Deities, as we call that: a Kuṇḍalinī Pūjā. By praying to My Kuṇḍalinī you improve your reflection. Because then the vibrations from Me start flowing into yours and they awaken it. This is the projection as far as you are concerned.</b><br />
Once the instrument is all right, then you project outside. And now how do you project? By worshiping the Goddess as the Protector of the whole Universe, praising Her different attributes, even Her Face, Her Hands, everything has a meaning. Praising Her Powers."</font><br />

First of all, I think this is the most important thing to understand about your own Kuṇḍalinī, as Self-realization is Self-knowledge. And the one who gives you Self-knowledge is this, your own Kuṇḍalinī, because when She rises She points it out what are the problems on your chakras.<br />
Now, we say that it is pure desire, but we do not know what purity means. It means your chaste desire. It means it has no lust, greed, anything in it. That power is your own mother and is settled in your triangular bone. She’s your own mother. She knows everything about you, it’s like a tape recorder. She knows everything about you and She is absolutely the knowledge – because She’s so pure."</font><br />

I have to tell people every day. So, what should be told to each one? How do I explain this? But this Power of Love is seen all around. This love is within Me. This give and take happens with love.

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are celebrating the great event of the Resurrection of Christ.</b> On the same pattern is your Resurrection, that you have risen to the new life of Divine Love. You were all in the knowledge that there is something higher that has to happen, that you have to be born-again. But, nobody knew how it works?<br />
The subtle side of your being was never told to you. The Saints only talked as to how you should behave. They only said how you should try to keep a very pure life, sincere life but they didn’t tell you how it will work out. Of course, people knew in India about it, very few of them, very very few. But, now it’s a worldwide knowledge through you people.<br />
<b>Now when your Kuṇḍalinī rises, She is your mother, She is your individual mother and She gives you the Second Birth. That’s how you get connected to the Divine Paradise. All this, if it is told without Realization has no meaning but people are given great ideas about it and also were promised that one day your Resurrection will come.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we have gathered here to do the Pūjā of Easter.</b><br />
In the history of spirituality, it is one of the greatest days when we find Christ rose from the dead. It is very significant and symbolic that in Sahaja Yoga, also what we have done, is to rise from the dead into life. It is to be understood that Resurrection is the message for all of us, for the whole world. We have to resurrect ourselves. There was no need for Jesus to do that. But He was a model: model of a Saint, model of a realized Soul, model of a person who came all the way from the Heavens to save us.<br />
So this Resurrection is also part and parcel of our lives. It is so symbolic, so very symbolic, that we were, in our consciousness, lost people. We had no control over ourselves as to know the way our mind told us to go.<br />
...... <b>He knew when the Resurrection takes place, the Kuṇḍalinī rises and connects you to the Divine Power, which is all-pervading. Then you start understanding that there’s a life beyond the life that you have made. There’s another type of life, a higher type of life, which connects you to the Divine Power.</b> And then this Divine Power gives you the Absolute Truth. If you grow more and more, you will know Absolute Truth because so far you don’t know."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Happy Easter to you all.<br />
So we celebrate Easter to show Christ resurrected Himself. The Spirit that is Christ has to resurrect out of the material manifestation of the Divine Itself. The matter is manifested because we ourselves have created it. Not that we are born out of matter, our body, but we are attached to it, we want it, we want to have it. Whatever you want, that sustains itself, by your desire, because now you are on the stage. If you want to sustain the matter, if you want to keep the matter as the first priority, it will remain. It cannot disappear. It has to go out of your mind that matter cannot hold you any further.<br />
Christ rose out of the matter, came out of the tomb which symbolizes the matter which has enclosed us within, which has to be opened out with our spiritual power. Throw away the stone that is covering this grave. Get out of that and stand outside it. This is the message of Christ’s Resurrection"</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"I have told you how Christ was created first in the Heavens. In the ‘Devī Māhātmyam, if you read that, He was created as Mahāviṣhṇu and is mentioned very clearly that first He was created as an egg. It is written in this book, which perhaps was written about fourteen thousand years back. It’s a book that predicts about Christ and that is why people, in the West specially, offer an egg to each other as a friend. So, first the existence came on this Earth as an egg, that was Christ, and part of it was kept in that stage and the rest of it was used by the Holy Ghost, by Mahālakṣhmī, to create Christ out of it.<br />
In that ancient book He was called as Mahāviṣhṇu: means the Greater Form of Viṣhṇu. But actually Viṣhṇu is the Father and He is the Son created by the Holy Ghost.<br />
After My lecture, I would like, if you have the book, to read it out to them the whole text of how Christ was created.<br />
And when He was created, He cried for His Father, as He cried also on the cross once. And He cried for years. And then <b>Christ, in Mahāviṣhṇu State, was blessed by His Father, who said that “Your position will be placed higher than Mine and You will be the Ādhāra,” means the Support of the Universe.</b> See, how from Mūlādhāra He becomes the Ādhāra. This was all done at the heavenly stage, Vaikuṇṭha Stage you can say.<br />
Then He was given birth by the Holy Ghost who was the Mother of Christ on this Earth, who was nobody else but was the Incarnation of Mahālakṣhmī, means She was Rādhā. Rā-dhā. Rā means energy, dhā means the one who sustains energy."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>The Redeemer was necessary, that's why Christ was established here, who was Rādhā's Son.</b><br />
You would be surprised that Mary Herself was Rādhā. There is a reason for this, a great reason.<br />
Sītājī was Śhrī Rāma's wife. Was married. The injustice that was done to Her by the society, made Her leave the house, by accusing Her falsely, disgraced Her. Why back then these great people had a blindfold on? Why didn't they say, that, `She is our Mother? You are asking Her to leave the house?' She already had passed the test, bypassing the fire, why were they dumbfounded then? What happened to their vigor [light] back then? All were so-called very great then. Nobody raised any point on that.<br />
To teach them a lesson Rādhājī did not marry Kṛiṣhṇa under the societal norms. But still, the whole world knows Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa as Rādhā-Kṛiṣhṇa. But for Him, the formal marriage is important, that's why there was no child.<br />
But in the next life, She came as Mary and Her Child glorified Her, who was a virgin."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Today we have come here to do Hanumāna’s Pūjā.<br />
Śhrī Hanumāna is a great character in our being and He runs all the way from Swādhiṣhṭhāna to your brain and He supplies all the necessary guidance we need in our futuristic planning or in our mental activities. He gives us guidance and protection.<br />
......<br />
It is very surprising how a Deity like Śhrī Hanumāna, who is an eternal child because He was like a monkey. His head was that of a monkey, if not of an elephant.<br />
So He was an eternal child and He was the one who was used to run the right side of human beings. He was told that “You must control the Sun,” to begin with He has to control the Sun, that the Sun in the people, if there is too much Sun then He must try to control it and make it cooler or smoother."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Today we are celebrating Hanumāna’s Jayanti [birthday].<br />
What to say about Hanumāna? The more powerful and wise, he was equally devoted and dedicated. Generally such a powerful person becomes right-sided and considers himself so high that he would not listen to anyone else. But Hanumāna is a special Deity, a typical Deity full of qualities. There was a perfect balance between his devotion and power. How could he achieve this balance is a thing to be understood. In Sahaja Yoga, when we are enlightened, we get many powers. Then we have to keep balance. We love others and with the power of the love, we keep on doing our duties.<br />
Each cell of Śhrī Hanumāna’s body was filled with power and devotion. Because of this speciality today we worship Śhrī Hanumāna all over the world. Small, small foreign children, when they start painting, I am surprised, first of all paint the picture of Śhrī Hanumāna."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"And the specialty of Hanumāna was that He was an angel. Angels are born like angels. They are angels, and they are not human beings. They’re born with the angelic qualities. But now, you all have become angels from the human beings. It’s a very great achievement of Sahaja Yoga. The qualities that are born with the angels are seen from their very childhood.<br />
<b>So in the left side, we have gaṇas, on the right side, we have angels. And translated in Sanskrit language or in any Indian language as Devadūt – means they are the Ambassadors of Gods. So now you are the same, you are all angels now.</b> Only thing you are not aware that you are angels while they were aware from their childhood. If you know that you are angels, all your qualities will start shining through, and you’ll be amazed that the quality of standing by the Truth at any cost is so easily managed for you because you have been given the right, you have been given the special blessings, the special protection from the Divine that if you stand for the right, and if you stand for the righteous, and if you stand for the Truth, all kinds of help to protect you will be given."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"He is an angel as you know, according to Christian, we should say, according to Bible, that He is the angel called Gabriel. Now, Gabriel is the one who brought the message, because He’s always a messenger, to Maria and surprisingly the words He used were “Immaculeta Salve.” That’s My name. My first name is Mātājī Nirmalā Devī, means Immaculeta and surname is Salve. He said those words to Her.<br />
So Maria has to do quite a lot with Hanumāna all Her life. That means Maria is the Mahālakṣhmī.<br />
Mahālakṣhmī being the Sītā, Sītā, then Rādhā, Hanumāna has to be there to serve Her. And that is why, you see, sometimes people say, “Mother, how did You know? Mother, how did You come to know? Mother, how did You send the message? Mother, how did You work it out?” Can you imagine?<br />
This is Śhrī Hanumāna’s headache, He does it. Anything passes through My mind He just takes it up and it’s done because as I told you that His whole organization is so well planned, all these messages from where do they get? Many people say, “Mother, I just prayed to You.”"</font><br />

When a human bowing before someone and regards him higher, it is the expression of that Divine Power. But when a person is respectful to his guru then he gets blessed with the grace and power of the guru.<br />
So the devotion and the power (bhakti aur śhakti) are not different things. It is one. We shall say that the right side is the source of power and the left of bhakti. Śhrī Hanumāna had in Him this harmony of bhakti and śhakti."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"The dignity of your power lies in becoming the guardians of poor and downtrodden. You have no need to fight with those who harass them and put them to trouble. Only bandhan will do the whole work for you. The power that you have achieved should be used to finish the negativity. But like Hanumāna you do not have to take Sword and Gadā in your hands. Your power is within you. By your experiences, you could see that anyone harassing you is automatically finished, whether you take up weapons or not. Thus you are protected and with you, other Sahaja Yogis will also be protected. In it, Śhrī Hanumāna has an important role. You do not know that he is with you. His nature is as pure and innocent as that of a child.<br />
But he is very discreet and full of all the qualities. He was blessed with Divine Discretion with which he could judge and understand everything with love."</font><br />

There are thousands of examples in Sahaja Yoga. People call them miracles.<br />
But I say that it is no miracle, it is the blessing of Śhrī Hanumāna.<br />
<b>So My blessings and Love to you all. Love yourself, also love others.</b><br />
Do not confine your love to “my son, my this, my that.” No!<br />
Love means selfless love (Nirvāja Pyār) love that expects no return, love that is not confined to relations only.<br />
You have been blessed with such unfathomable Power of Love. Use it.<br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Such dedication for Śhrī Rāma that by the time He grew up He got Nine Siddhis, Navadhā Siddhis. Nine Siddhis He got.<br />
These siddhis are like this that He could become big, He could become so heavy that nobody could lift Him, He could become so sūkṣhma that nobody could see Him, He could become so subtle that nobody could see Him.<br /> 
There are Nine Siddhis that He got.<br />
So, a person who has got the right side too much in him, He controls him with these Nine Siddhis.<br />
He has got another siddhis, which are very interesting is that He can extend His – He doesn’t have many weapons, He has only one gadā in His hand and He can extend His tail to any extent and He can handle people with His tail, He does not have to use His hand. Sitting down here, He can put the tail around anywhere.<br />
If He wants He can just make a mountain of His tail and sit on that.<br /> 
Like He has all these monkey tricks as you call them, you see, and all these tricks He has within Himself is to control a person who is extremely right-sided, to begin with.<br />
Then He can fly in the air. Just ... He doesn’t have any wings, but He can just fly in the air.<br />
That means He can become so big that the amount of air He displaces has much more weight than His own weight ......"</font><br />

Mahāvīra is the Incarnation of Bhairavanāth, or you call Him as Saint Michael. Now these two Saints as you know one as the Gabriel, Hanumāna, and another is Saint Michael. One is placed on the Piṅgalā nāḍī and another one, Saint Michael, on the Iḍā nāḍī."</font><br />

<b>Auṃ Twameva sākṣhāt Śhrī Mahāvīra sākṣhāt Śhrī Ādi Śhakti Mātājī Śhrī Nirmalā Devī namo namaḥ!</b><br />
O Divine Mother, You are verily Śhrī Mahāvīra! Salutations to You! 
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>In Sahaj we very much respect and understand Mahāvīrjī and we also accept that He is the Incarnation of Śhrī Bhairavnāth and not only this he took birth many times and later also came as Hasan and Husayn.</b><br />
In Bible, Bhiaravnāthjī is addressed as Saint George and some refer him as Saint Michael. It is very surprising that London which we understand as Heart has Saint George as its angel. That is! They accept Bhairavnāth so it’s correct. Because if Śhivjī resides in heart then having Bhairavnāth is important. There are so many things which if we read with understanding then they are all interconnected and how is their relation automatically established. In Sahaj Śhakti you get overwhelmed and you enjoy it and this makes Me happy. God has created this universe for you so you should enjoy it, what else do you want. In you, there are many powers and you use them and you have also shared it with others. In this way, the family of our Sahaj should grow. We should save as many possible, most important our children. We should take care of them because a wrong type of culture has started and the children are getting affected. So we should pay attention to it and to them and take care of them. When they are established in Sahaj then they will not go around."</font><br />

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">So we have to thank really very much Mahāvīra, who has given us this power to remove our left-sided problems, who has given us this light in our hand, which He Himself vibrates and He Himself tries to throw some light on the obscure things about Me also. Because of Him only, we can get cured of so many physical and mental troubles.<br />
<b>You know that the left side can be easily cured if you use three-candle treatment. That shows Mahāvīra is only fond of light. He doesn't like darkness</b> and His idea is, I think that way, is to now fully go all the way to clear the left side as far as possible, to help Sahaja Yoga to establish in countries where I find still lot of this negativity is there -- a lot of it. </font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"The ascetic life of Mahāvīra was of a very, very extreme nature. He was the one who was born in a ... uh ... clan of warriors, Kṣhatriyas. And then He was also married, also He had a daughter. And then He decided, because He knew He had to do the work of the Divine, He decided to take a saṃnyāsa. So He took uh the permission of His brother because His parents were dead. He was a king, so He gave up all His uh material wealth, everything and He beg ... became a complete saṃnyāsī. And the He left His family, His left His ... house, everything behind and went alone with a little bowl for begging alms. And there people who joined Him were very few, and He asked them that, ``You have to also become ascetics," Munis.<br />
He was a Reincarnation of Saint Michael and He resides on the left side, on the Iḍā nāḍī. And He looks after the whole of it, right from Mūlādhāra onwards up to the Sahasrāra. <b>So Saint Michael was born as Mahāvīra, meaning The Greatest Warrior. But when He was born, the whole place got lot of uh prosperity, that's why He was called as Vardhamān, to begin with.</b><br />
But His asceticism was there because of the Brahminism that was so prevalent in those days, and people were absolutely drowned into it. "</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Now Mahāvīra also was one of them, who was born again and again and he was Mārkaṇḍeya and he was Kabīra, the way Kabīra lashes people you can see that he is tremendous, he is like Bhairava and the Power of Bhairava, Kabīra has used in his language, but for Hindi poets it is Sadhukaddi [vernacular dialect of Hindi+Punjabi+Māravāṛī in medieval North India] and they have made fun of it."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"So today I am saying this, <b>that this left side which is music, art which has this emotions (bhāvanā) shows it.</b><br />
Even though Saraswatī has created all the Swaras, so what!<br />
but the emotions it contains, the bhakti it contains it is due to the blessings of Mahāvīr.<br />
Mahāvīr has really worked hard for this because he scared people that if you go to the wrong way,<br />
you go to hell, and on taking this correct way you will be overwhelmed and you all are actually witnessing it.<br />
Like this, we all should increase our bhakti and growing bhakti in the work of Mahāvīr."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>We have gathered here on the occasion of Rām Navamī.</b> Everybody has said, “Mother please tell us about Śhrī Rām.”<br />
You know that Śhrī Rāma has a very important place on our chakra, He is situated on our right Heart. Śhrī Rāma has taken the place of father hence if there is lack in the responsibility or love from father this chakra is caught. In Sahaja Yoga, we to understand that Śhrī Rāma and all other Deities have taken the form to fulfill their divine work, in all Śhrī Rāma had a special task. As it was said by Socrates that the Benevolent King has to come the same way Śhrī Rāma had come on this Earth as benevolent king, He came in the form of human being, He even forgot that He was Incarnation of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, forgot about Him but for all world, <b>He was Puruṣhottama Rāma</b>."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Today is Rām Navamī. I should say it was not started, we should say, but it was very much in vogue when Rāma lived and they used to do Yagñyas at that time. The reason was, that the people had just started realizing that “there is something higher and you have to worship that higher Self,” the Seers said, and they thought that the best thing is to do Yagñyas. The same thing.<br />
On the left side, of course, the people started the worship of God and the dedication to God and all those things. That is ‘bhakti’ [devotion]. But mainly what they did before Rāma was the Yagñyas, the Vedas, with which they prayed to different elements. Elements have made our chakras, and they tried to evoke the Deities of the Elements. But actually it amounts to the same [thing].<br />
So, as a child, Rāma was studying with a very great Saint, and when he was studying with him, Vasiṣhṭha was the name of the great Saint. And Vasiṣhṭha had an āśhram where Rāma and His brothers studied."</font><br />

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"...... the story of Rāma they say was written before He was born. Even before there was any inkling of it, the Seer, Vālmīki, wrote the whole story of Śhrī Rāma.<br />
Śhrī Rāma’s birth and all that are brought forth by the Agni, the fire, and He was born in the Dynasty of the Sūrya, is the Sun. So, with all that, with born out of the blessings of the Agni, that is fire, and also was born in the dynasty of Sūrya, He was one of the mildest Avatāras you have ever had. He’s known to be a very – something for, I mean English language – formal person, in the sense, saṅkoch, that He  would go to any extent to bear upon Himself the problems than to tell others to do something."</font><br />

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image940.png" /></div>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="blue">"Śhrī Rāma was also a great Devī bhakta, that is, devotee of Śhakti.<br />
Before attacking Sri Lanka He performed Devī Pūjā for which He needed a Brahmin for conducting various rites to please the Devī.<br />
He then sent for Rāvaṇa the King of Sri Lanka, who was a Brahmin and Devī bhakta.<br />
He readily responded and helped Śhrī Rāma in performing the Pūjā of the Devī with all nine types of rites.<br />
Had Śhrī Rāma been of a cunning disposition, <b>He could have killed Śhrī Rāvaṇa then and there but He was a Maryādā Puruṣhottama.</b><br />
He did not do such a mean and irresponsible act.<br />
They were enemies but while performing the Pūjā the enmity was completely forgotten."</font><br />

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So Śhrī Rāma’s another great quality was once given a promise – is to be kept.</b> This is another quality we have to have that, if you have promised anything, you have to keep it. If you have said, “I will do this,” you must do it. You should not find out excuses to avoid it. It’s absolutely an anti-God activity to avoid doing things that you have promised. Your Deities will never be happy. You must see that, whatever you have promised you must do."</font><br />

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"And this is another quality of Śhrī Rāma, is a saṅkoch. There’s no word in English language because you have ‘formality’ which is a very insipid word to describe saṅkoch. Because, there is no integration between your heart and formality.<br />
...... So that saṅkocha, that understanding comes if you love someone and understand. Now, you have to love all the seekers of the world. They have done wrong, they have done all kinds of ego trips, they have done all kinds of mistakes but your Mother loves them and you have to love them. If they are to be corrected I’ll do that. You just don’t do that way that they feel hurt. Put a saṅkocha. While talking to each other educate yourself, train yourself to say things which are sweet and nice, which will make another person feel that this person is a properly brought up person in Sahaja Yoga tradition. So we have a Sahaja Yoga tradition also, in which, when we speak to each other, we have that saṅkocha within us of Śhrī Rāma. And if you do not have that saṅkocha you get the right Heart [catch]."</font><br />

He is beyond birth and death, His powers have no limits and through His own Divine Play (Līlā),He has incarnated to destroy all the negative forces and to protect this world.</font><br /> 
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"In Sahaja Yoga when we worship any God, what quality we gain from them, which qualities we will receive? Śhrī Rāma has many. One that <b>He was ideal, another that He is a king. He kept His people higher than Himself, than his wife and children. If politicians today understand this point, they wouldn’t be called selfish, they wouldn’t be selfish, would be follower of dharma</b>.<br />
Nobody has followed Śhrī Rāma as a role model till today. By singing His bhajans or building institutions and temples in His name, does Śhrī Rāma come to you? Do you get His light in your life? Only a Sahaja Yogi can bring the light of Śhrī Rāma into the attention."</font><br />

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So we have to create out of Sahaja Yogis great politicians. It has been predicted [in the Nāḍi Granth] that if Sahaja Yoga does not spread then the third world war is inevitable. People will suffer a lot with a third world war. It is possible to avoid it if people take to Sahaja Yoga in a big number. But if they do not, there will be a third world war and the effects of that will harm people so much that ultimately it is the Sahaja Yogis who will be called for a conference and not the diplomats. The Sahaja Yogis will be consulted, and they will decide what is to be done for the world and they will become the rulers of tomorrow’s world. So we must have a full idea [of] how to be rulers like Śhrī Rāma.<br />
We have to go too far with ourselves, to training up ourselves, educating ourselves, getting rid of our egos and understanding that we have to grow."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Today I said that Śhrī Rāma was born at twelve o’clock hence the Pūjā should be at time as such it is not long Pūjā but we have to understand that the human form within us in form of humanity in which we understand and make changes in our mind, curiosity and thoughts.<br />
Through the medium of Śhrī Rāma can bring change in our thoughts, he can bring change in our behavior because he is ideal for us, reaching this ideal we can reach other ideals since he is ideal of human being.<br />
<b>This is big thing that the God Himself came on this Earth and become ideal.<br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>This Kuṇḍalinī Śhakti is your pure desire. It is the Desire of God Almighty.</b> When it is awakened in you, you get contented. You get satisfied and think that instead of material desire now I have entered into such a beautiful garden which is fragrant, full of joy, peace, and love. When you achieve that state then you do not look back to material desires. To achieve this state in Sahaja Yoga is extremely beautiful. It happens very easily, you have to do nothing for it, give no money, do no rituals, no prayers, nothing. You should only have the pure desire to know the Spirit."</font><br />

All these Powers are there for us to ascent. If these Powers are properly used and understood, then your ascent can be permanent. Once you achieve your ascent and enter into the Kingdom of God, all these Powers get enlightened. And these Powers which are enlightened are absolutely filled with Love.<br />
Enlightenment, we have to understand that we get completely enlightened by Love. So after enlightenment, after Realization, we use only one Power which is of Love."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"The way different Deities manifest themselves to do certain thing, similarly the Goddess manifests Herself as Their Power, Śhakti. Without the Śhakti no Deity could work out things, whether it is Incarnation of Rāma, Kṛiṣhṇa, Jesus Christ or anyone else. All of them had a Goddess as Their Power (Śhakti). That is the reason so much importance and respect is given to mother in our country. Indians are worshipers of Śhakti, irrespective of all the difference and problems. They are the worshipers of Śhakti.<br />
Those who follow Viṣhṇu or Śhiva are also worshipers of Śhakti because Śhakti is the Mother and mother belongs to all. Mother is a very significant institution in our country. So we should always respect the mother."</font><br />

It is Her Grace that we find our culture the dharma of wife, dharma of husband, dharma of ruling, etc. which are nourished by Her Śhakti.<br />
<b>You all know the story of Satī Devī, I don't have to tell you in new way but She was Gangaur.</b> She was married and while She was returning after marriage with Her husband some of the bad elements surrounded them and killed Her husband. She came out of the bride's carriage, took the Rudra Form and destroyed all of them who attacked Her husband and then She finished Herself also. We should see in this that since childhood till marriage She did not disclose that She was Mahāmāyā in any condition."</font><br />

So she, in the morning she came and touched My Feet. And she said, "Mother, can I'p worship You?" I said, "Why?" "Because You are my Gangaur, really. That's just a statue." She made Me stand the same way, she did everything, she made Me eat betel. Uh I don't eat all that, but he, she said, "You have to, You are Gangaur, so You have to eat it."
