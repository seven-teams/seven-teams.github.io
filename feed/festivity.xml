Mahākālī, Mahāsaraswatī and Mahālakṣhmī, and three of Them put together in the brain, then become the Ādi Śhakti, the Primordial Mother. And that also we call it as the Ādi Śhakti's Seat, that is above your head."</font><br />

[<font color="orange">unclear</font>] I have seen that here people worship Mahākālī and Saraswatī, people worship Devī and people are simple natured.<br />
We should worship Saraswatī as well.<br />
Saraswatī’s work is very great. First, Mahāsaraswatī created the entire universe.<br />
The earth element is special in this. The earth element has been placed in such a way between the Sun and the Moon that any living work can easily happen on it.<br />
From this living work, slowly and gradually human beings have been generated.<br />
But we should know our own great power.<br />
That power is what we call creation power, it’s also called creativity.<br />
This creation power is the blessing of Saraswatī by which many arts have been generated. The evolution of art is due to the blessings of Saraswatī."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"Hiraṇyagarbha (Prajāpati) is the creator aspect of God Almighty.

(The way this Void was created is covered later.) <b>Hiraṇyagarbha’s Power incarnates as Mahāsaraswatī, and the entire material creation is the product of Her power and activity:</b> She created all the galaxies, stars, and planets including our own Sun, Moon, and Earth. She also functions as the thinking power of the Primordial Being, and this process generates the Cosmic Ego (Ādi Ahaṅkāra). The channel carrying this power is the Ādi Piṅgalā Nāḍī, and it expresses the Primordial Preconscious Mind (Ādi Chitta). It acts like a postman who carries messages to the intellect of the Almighty."</font><br />

So we must know what are in the books, means in the Scriptures. We must know how it relates to the Scriptures like it should not be something just coming like a mushroom knowledge, but it should be related to the books, means which is already written down, which is already being typed, being printed.<br />
But that doesn’t mean that it is a bookish knowledge, but it is whatever you have found out, whatever you have discovered has to be related to the books. And that is the Power She gives us, that She relates.<br />

<font color="DarkRed">"In school, our kids are absorbing knowledge. But we should be careful that without Self-realization whatever knowledge you get will be impure knowledge.

Kids are of two types: one loves studying and the other don’t enjoy studying. Some kids have less brain and others have more.<br />
<b>Brain is also the gift of Saraswatī but the Ātmā gives us wisdom. Whatever knowledge you get from your brains, until you weigh it on your wisdom, then that knowledge becomes harmful.</b><br />
...... <b>With the realization of the Ātmā, itself, the brain gets the incandescent of Śhrī Saraswatī</b>, and even the children who are weak in reading and writing start doing good work. After this, the growth of art begins.<br />
If one wants to develop art without Self-realization the art is not treated with respect [is unrecognized] and there is no name or sign of it and is eventually lost.<br />
So, <b>first of all, getting the Self-realization and then doing Saraswatī Pūjā is in itself a great thing</b>."</font><br />

<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Today is a very big day because the actual Pure Spirit has taken birth today.</b> And He already had such an eternal state, that many people could not comprehend it or write about it. They wrote only what they understood, but now that you are realized you can understand that by the Power of Śhrī Gaṇeśha’s name, you can get your Realization. By taking His name alone any disease or any pain will disappear. He is eternal. He is always present within us, when you get your Realization, you can feel Him.
And if you are not realized, you cannot understand Him. That is why people get misled and do wrong things. But with Śhrī Gaṇeśha’s blessings, you can do so many things and neither you will feel greedy, nor will you have any problems. Because He does all the work for you."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"For Sahaj Yogis, it is very important, because if say, there’s a cloth or a sāṛī which is blown off by the wind, even if you can hold it on one corner, you can hold it, and after some time the whole thing can subside.<br />
And this is what has to happen actually to the world, when Sahaj Yogis will hold the sāṛī, we can call, or this Universe with their wisdom and firm faith in Sahaja Yoga.
Otherwise, they can be blown off also. If they are not rightly placed, if they are not grounded, if they are not fixed to their own enlightened faith of Sahaja Yoga,<br />
they can be blown off with this wind which is there to torture the whole world, to destroy the whole world.<br />
<b>So the responsibility of Sahaja Yogis is very important that their Gaṇeśh Principle should be all right.<br />
If it is not all right, then the whole of Sahaja Yoga movement can collapse.<br />
For ladies and for men, I have to make a humble request: that they should try to put their Śhrī Gaṇeśh in a very respectable position in their lifestyle.<br />
That should be the highest, the most important, and also every day to be remembered that we are very much blessed by Śhrī Gaṇeśh to get your Self-realization.</b>"</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are celebrating here a special day called Makar Saṅkrānt.</b> For the information of the foreign Sahaja Yogis, I will explain to you what it means.<br />
......<br />
It means the day, today is the day the Sun crosses over from the Tropic of Capricorn to the Tropic of Cancer. It is a very big day for us because, now during the summertime we have the harvest, and we look forward to the rain and so many things that happen in every country. The Sun falls at right angles in this country during the summer season and so we welcome the Sun. We eat something -- that you must have eaten already -- what we call as tīḷ and jaggery. It is to prepare your body and your mind to give it sufficiency to receive the Sun. Because if you are living in the cool season, then all your body, mind becomes lethargic and you become also sometimes very lazy about things in the sense, that the day is so small, that you cannot achieve many results. So the body has become cold as we call it. We take these things, which give us heat so body is prepared to receive the heat of the Sun to welcome."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"The meaning of Makar Saṅkrānti is saṅkramaṇ, that is, the day that brings about some change. <b>On this day the Sun starts its movement toward the Northern Hemisphere. In India, all the festivals are according to the position of the Moon. That’s why their dates are different in different years. Makar Saṅkrānti is based on the position of the Sun and that is the reason this festival is celebrated every year on fourteenth January.</b><br />
Makar Saṅkrānti indicates the day when the Sun becomes warmer. The heat of the Sun is benevolent for the human race. It is because of this heat that we can walk, we can talk. The heat of the Sun makes a human being angry. This is the reason why we take jaggery on this day so that we talk sweetly. The heat of the Sun is responsible for all the vegetation and wealth of the Earth. On this day we offer fruits and vegetables to the Devī and receive Her blessings. With the blessings of Ādi Śhakti the earth element cools down and the human race progresses."</font><br />

What should you do to make Her happy? You distributed sesame seeds and jaggery. That is for love. To increase the love between each other, we give sesame seeds and jaggery.<br />
Today the Sun left its place and, in its northward movement, came towards us. At this moment we should be very thankful to the Sun. It is by the grace of the Sun that so many things take place in our country. <b>We have to do namaskār to the Sun today and His Power and His knowledge should come to us.</b><br />

So this is a religion that is within you which is enlightened through Kuṇḍalinī and then it works out. But it is an Absolute Religion in the sense that you all feel the same thing. If you feel one finger the other is also going to feel the same thing."</font><br />

In the same tradition we had many Gurus in our country and specially in the area near Bombay [Mumbai], which is called as Maharashtra.<br />
They came as Nāth. <b>They were called as Nāth.</b> So the first one was Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], then Dattātreya, then Macchindranāth, then Gorakhnāth, like that a tradition of these Gurus came.<br />
But all their knowledge was kept as a guarded secret. It was a Gupta Vidyā, is absolutely guarded secret, a secret knowledge about Kuṇḍalinī. They never talked about it; they never told about it. Because they thought that, 'Just now let us experiment with it fully and then we will give some idea about it to people.'<br />
But as you see everywhere it happens, even it happens with us here sometimes that we get people who do not get Realization or are half-baked and they cannot rise much higher. Then they get, sort of you see, very angry or sometimes they take this half-baked knowledge and start working on it and they go absolutely wrong on this side or that side."</font><br />

<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Today is the birthday of Śhrī Guru Nāṇaka.</b> It is being celebrated throughout the world with so much of zeal that I have not seen in India. For the first time it has been advertised in so many papers and by different means.<br />
Guru Nāṇaka always talked of Sahaja Yoga. ``Everything else," He said, ``is just showing off." About religion He said that, "Observing fasts, going on pilgrimage, etc., are just meant to show off. Now you have to discover the power that is within you and establish it." Guru Nāṇaka kept on repeating the same thing again and again.<br />
......<br />
But Guru Nāṇaka always talked of the Spirit. He explained it very clearly, but no one heeded what he wrote. They will just put a finger on the couplet and read it out. Could we understand him this way? If we go through his writings properly and absorb it, then the whole śhabda jālam [web of words], in which most of the people are caught, will come to an end. See the condition of Sikhs!<br />
Without looking within and experiencing the innate energy, how could one follow Sikh religion? Only this is the teaching of Guru Nāṇaka, this is what is called `Sikh' [learning]. All the Saints of that age had the discretion to know who is a Saint and who is not. All the gurus incorporated their poems and experiences in Guru Grantha and that is why Guru Grantha is revered so much. Only the renowned gurus contributed to it. They were so spiritual that they did churning of all the religious Scriptures and put the substance in Guru Grantha.<br />
That is what we do in Sahaja Yoga. <b>We do not follow any particular Saint or Incarnation; we respect all of them and strike a balance.</b>"</font><br />

Of course, the people who were there at His time were so useless and gross people that they actually tortured His life and nobody followed Him. After His death is a different point.

Actually Mussulman means the person who is realized and Pīr is a person whose Realization is established so much so that he said that those who have become Mussulman should be buried and not burnt, because he thought they are all realized Souls, but Realization finished off with his son-in-law and his daughter, after that he had two sons who were great Souls who are really the Reincarnation[s] of Lav and Kuśh."</font><br />

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNeQY2lnjko">video</a><br />
Guru Nāṇak Dev has imagined the entire universe decorated as a prayer platter on the altar of the almighty. The starting verses of the Āratī are as follows:<br />
"Gagan mein thaal, rav chand deepak bane, taarka mandal janak moti dhoop malay aan lao, pawan chavro kare sagal ban raai phulant jyoti kaisi Āratī hoye, bhavkhandana teri Āratī.<br />
anhat sabad bajant bheri kaisi Āratī hoye, bhavkhandana teri Āratī."<br />
Means: "The sky is the prayer platter, the sun and the moon are the lamps, and the stars and the constellations are the pearls and jewels. The air coming from the sandal-laden Malay mountain is the incense, the air is the fan, and the entire flora of the earth are the flowers ..... oh ... what an Āratī is it! O Destroyer of Fear!"<br />

And the purity of that relationship is to be maintained.<br />
It is not necessary that you should be born as brothers and sisters, not necessary.<br />
But you are born because if you are realized Souls you are born as brothers and sisters.<br />
So that purity must be maintained in the society of Sahaja Yoga. Very important, that we should try to develop this situation that brothers and sisters are something very pure. Their relationships are very pure. And they should not be at all challenged.<br />
It is so much so that even if you call somebody your brother, he is your brother and the more you develop this relationship, the better your left Viśhuddhi will be.<br /> 
Because left Viśhuddhi is the relationship with God as a brother or with a Goddess as a sister."</font><br />

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"But for a gṛuhalakṣhmī, the brother is very important.<br />
<b>And the brotherhood and sisterhood is the base of our Sahaj Yoga collectivity.</b> If you understand that brotherhood and sisterhood is love which is very pure, there is no expectation, is just love: is giving love and taking love. And Absolute Purity within us should exist between our relationships when we call them as Sahaj Yogi brothers and sisters. And as there is understanding, complete understanding between the brother and sister, in a family, one has to know we are all part and parcel of a family, born out [of] the same Mother.<br />
Nobody has to shoot off, you know, nobody has to become something great, nobody has to correct others, nobody has to uh say that, ‘I’m something unique.’ All of you have to work it out together and find out the solution working out together, in complete friendship and unison. Anyone who cuts off himself and goes out or becomes anything else goes out of circulation and useless for Sahaj Yoga. Such a person is completely useless: the one who tries to get out of the family. All of you have to be supporting as each other, helping to each other, not shouting at each other, [not] getting angry with each other, trusting each other, not finding faults, treating each other with respect [unclear and love].<br />
This is the most important thing, which Sahaj Yogis don’t understand, that you are Saints and you have to respect each other."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So the whole idea of celebrating today the Lakṣhmī’s day is to understand that in us She has become the Mahālakṣhmī.</b> By that we have so many powers of which we are not aware, I mean we do not know that we are realized Souls. Some of us, we do not know and that we have those powers within us that we can permeate into others. We can project our personalities to others. We can find out what’s wrong with them. We can find out about ourselves.<br />
We can go into ourselves, we can go into – our permeation is like water is moving, is flowing all the time.<br />
And this is a very important thing that we should be aware of: our powers that we have achieved.<br />
Mahālakṣhmī gives us dignity. And that’s how we start understanding the value of human dignity. We should have also the idea of human dignity that we cannot insult human dignity, like people who are nagging others all the time. It’s against or all the time asserting themselves about something making everybody’s life miserable. It’s against human dignity.

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So what is the Principle of Mahālakṣhmī? Is that first is of sacrifice.</b> Sacrifice their own children on the Altar of Truth. Of course that is not needed in Sahaja Yoga. You are all blessed people, you don't have to sacrifice anything whatsoever. But if you do not develop your children into proper ways, they will hold you responsible and they will say, "Why did you not give us a full scope to develop?"<br />
......<br />
So this Mahālakṣhmī Principle has to grow among men, as well as in women. We have families now and this has to work out, that, do the whole family people sit down and meditate? Do we teach our children the proper protocol of Śhrī Mātājī? Like a lady bringing a perambulator in the hall -- is absurd! I mean, can you bring a perambulator in the church? This is more than a church. Do you realize whom are you facing? <b>And this is what you have to tell your children because this is the greatest time. This is the greatest time when you are here, the greatest time of spirituality, of the complete manifestation of the Powers of the Goddess, where your children have to be the real flowers of beauty.</b> Please don't try to cover them up with their souls dying out there under the cover of so-called love for them."</font><br />

Now you do not keep this joy to yourself but you become generous about it and you go all out to give it to others. Generosity at another level, at a lower level is transformed into this Universal Love. Whatever you gain, whatever joy, satisfaction, vibrations, knowledge, all that you want to give it to others. You want to spread it because now you got the reality and you don't want to keep it to yourself, you think it is very important that everyone in the world should know about reality.<br />
This is significant in putting these lights, that now you are the lights. It is the darkest night today, tonight is the darkest night, in the same way these are the darkest days, this is the Kali Yuga and it is the core Kali Yuga, the worst time where the worst things are happening, human beings are going to the worst level and at this time we have to put Sahaja Yoga before them. You know what is the ordeal one has to go through to break the hard nuts of the brains of people, but it is working, it has clicked already. ......<br />
Now you have to enlighten many lights, we call it Dīpawali, Diwālī is dīpāwali, means the rows of lights, and by celebrating this Diwālī with so many of you I'm sure we'll have such a torch of light which will go around the whole world. Just remember you are not a small drop, now you have become the Ocean and you have to spread. Now you are sitting on your thrones and assume your powers.

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>You know that today is the Pūjā of Śhrī Lakṣhmī.</b> Here nobody performs Lakṣhmī Pūjā. So, it must be understood that today is a very important day. <b>Lakṣhmī gives you everything. She is Mother. She gives everything, all blessings, all comfort, and most important is that She enlightens your inner being.</b><br />
So somehow you recognize Lakṣhmī. Lakṣhmī doesn’t mean money. You have to understand that She is a Goddess, and you have to respect money like a Goddess. In our country, people do a lot for the sake of money; wrong things that are very bad. But you have got a responsibility to recognize Lakṣhmī as Devī, and worship Her and understand that you cannot make fun of Lakṣhmī. Lakṣhmī blesses you and will go on blessing you. Such evil people are a few only, and you should be contented that Lakṣhmī resides in your being and has accumulated many moments of joy and comfort for you. You are going to get all that and have already got it.<br />
...... I am sure that everyone will worship Lakṣhmī, and in the Lakṣhmī Pūjā, one should understand all forms of Lakṣhmī and what Her nature is. We cannot understand Her, and if we cannot understand Her, we will follow the wrong path. So it should be understood that She is Devī and that She is your Mother, and that She can do anything for you because She is very powerful and very affectionate, She doesn’t give you any problem.<br />
If you get trapped somewhere, She will save you. Such is the blessing of Lakṣhmī."</font><br />

<font color="DarkRed">"When this thing happens that you get some position, any power, even in Sahaja Yoga I was surprised. If somebody becomes leader, I don’t know what happens to him. It is a myth. There’s nothing like leadership in Sahaja Yoga, nothing like that. It’s just a myth. But suddenly people jump up. It is ego that gets pampered.<br />
But this ego can be easily managed if you worship the Rājalakṣhmī. She is the giver of balance. Firstly, She rides on the elephant. Is not easy for a lady to climb on an elephant, I have done it, it’s not easy. Without fear. And She sits straight with a complete balanced attitude. And Her blessings are tremendous.<br />
The first blessing one gets the imbibement of dignity. Dignity of a king, dignity of a queen. You are a queen so you can’t behave like street woman. With Her blessing, first of all, you get that dignity. That dignity is full of love, love for others. That personality emits nothing but love and benevolence for others, nothing else. Wherever She looks, in every glance She blesses people. She doesn’t expect anything. She is a queen, what can you give to the queen? She’s the highest of all in every way, what can you give it to Her?<br />
So <b>first thing is the sign, is that such a person has a personality that just blesses people, thinks of their benevolence, cares for each and every person who comes along. This is a blessing of the Goddess. Then the second blessing of the Goddess is that you develop a kind of a temperament, which is very dignified, but also very humorous and understanding what other people are like.</b>"</font><br />

Now there are eight Lakṣhmīs, which she will read it out. And I will tell you later on what is the meaning of all [them]. So one of them is Gṛuhalakṣhmī.<br />
<b>So the first is the form of a Gṛuhalakṣhmī. She is born as a Gṛuhalakṣhmī, to begin with. That means the awareness, of human beings also, started really getting into evolutionary process when they started their family life.</b> When they were vagabonds, moving about, then the awareness was just like animals.

So She is the first Lakṣhmī who was born, and that's why on that thirteenth day is the day of the Gṛuhalakṣhmī, of the housewife. And so, one has to go in the market and buy some utensils or something that she uses for cooking in the house. In India on the thirteenth day everyone goes and buys a pot or, say, we can say, what you call, a cooking utensil or something. Or they may buy a sāṛī or something or gold or something for the gṛuhalakṣhmī. That is the day of the housewife.<br />
So, to reach the Lakṣhmī one has to understand that motherhood is very important. The <b>motherhood as a gṛuhalakṣhmī is important</b>."</font><br />

<font color="DarkGreen">"Today is a very interesting day when you are worshiping the Gṛuhalakṣhmī here, with the Gṛuhalakṣhmī of this house.
In the same way, in your families, also in your houses, homes, you must do gṛuhalakṣhmī’s pūjā. 
The woman has to be a gṛuhalakṣhmī herself, and then she should be worshiped.
<b>“Yatra narya[stu] pujyante tatra ramante Devatā."</b> 
“Where the women are respected and worshiped, there reside all the Deities.” 
But they should be respectable also. If they are not respectable, then the Deities won’t reside there. 
It’s a big responsibility on a Gṛuhalakṣhmī to be the respectable so that all the Deities are happy in the family. 
And once she is respected, she will try to be respectable also. So, the respect of the gṛuhalakṣhmī is very important."</font><br />
