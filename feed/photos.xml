We are pleased to bring to your attention the oldest website of Photographs <a href="https://imageevent.com/sahaja"><font color="DarkGreen"><b>Jai Shri Mataji or Sahaja Image Events</b></font></a> which is managed since the end of 2021 by the Photo Subteam. We have just taken the small Step 4 of the database: the sharing of all photos Moments of Growth and of other related photos. To begin with about 230 photos uploaded yesterday and today we have just created 3 new folders with 12 galleries in total and we hope many-many more will follow out of the thousands and thousands of such photos currently in the CCT database. The Step 4 is part of the yearly long offering at the Lotus Feet of our Divine Mother and of the sharing celebrating the 100 years Birthday Anniversary and expressing our eternal gratitude and love to Her.<br />
You are all invited to either start dedicated new galleries or to contribute to the existing galleries on this website.<br />

<br />
Dear Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginīs,<br />
<br />
The website <a href="https://eternalmoments.smugmug.com/"> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Eternal Moments</b></font></a> has now 23,214 Photographs of Śhrī Mātājī, including versions and details (an increment of 2,150 since the last annual report), and 7,207 photos Moments of Joy (an increment of 3,724 since the last annual report). There are 26 (named) Collections with 21,753 Photographs of Śhrī Mātājī and 7,138 photos Moments of Joy.<br />
<br />
The XYZ Folder of the Collections shall be completed by May 5, 2023.<br />
<br />
So, there are more than 30.4K Photos and photos Moments of Joy uploaded to the website. When essentially completed, it is projected that the website will have between 60K and 5 million Photos and photos Moments of Joy, and each year we will reestimate these bounds.<br />
<br />
We will start having short posts announcing new events for which Photos have been just uploaded. They will be grouped under two numbered posts: one on early Photos (before 1976-0101) and one on special or less known events.<br />
<br />
Following in the footsteps of the Divine Cool Breeze website of Photographs, the download buttons for Photographs will be activated on May 5, 2023 (in the Chronology Folder to begin with). Accordingly, we will be using every opportunity to remind everyone about the delicate protocols that accompany the sharing of Photos. We really expect that all Photos downloaded from Eternal Moments will be exclusively used for worshiping and for the well-established Sahaja Yoga Projects, by which we mean projects which THROUGHOUT the history of Sahaja Yoga have been regarded as Sahaja Yoga Projects. Among these projects we explicitly mention the spreading of Sahaja Yoga via Public Programs or publications or dedicated, well-organized websites that have full self-control on their promotions. In particular, we do not regard websites or accounts that are either non-dedicated or are not well-organized or are promoted by third parties or mixed with other promotions as well-established Sahaja Yoga projects and as such our team would be very grateful to everyone if we could all refrain from downloading Photos and photos Moments of Joy and re-uploading them to such websites and accounts.<br />

Dear Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginīs,<br />
<br />
Jay Śhrī Mātājī!<br />
<br />
The photos of handwritings are very special photos Moments of Joy that are very relevant to multiple projects, searches, and studies. As such, we are pleased to make an offering at the Lotus Feet of Śhrī Mātājī and to let you know that Handwritings Galleries have been singled out from the Moments of Joy Galleries. They will be showing up in both the Collections Folders as well as altogether in the Moments of Joy Folder of the <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Eternal Moments</b></font> website of Photographs of Śhrī Mātājī.<br />
</p>

<p>The link to the website is:<a href="https://eternalmoments.smugmug.com/"> website</a></p>

<p>The direct link to the altogether Handwritings Gallery is: <a href="https://eternalmoments.smugmug.com/Moments-of-Joy/Handwritings/"> link</a></p>

<p>
Currently this gallery contains 108 handwritings (as photos) but we will gradually add more.<br />
<br />
We would be most happy to receive, enjoy, study, and share more handwritings of our Divine Mother. We thank you in advance for any help, support, and feedback. Please write to us at sahajayoga.compilations@gmail.com<br />

<p>Jay Śhrī Mātājī!</p>

<p>As part of the celebration of the 52nd anniversary of the <font color="DeepPink"><b>Sahasrāra Day</b></font>, we are pleased to offer at the Lotus Feet of our Divine Mother and to bring to your attention the search feature added to the navigation menu of the <font color="blue"><b>Eternal Moments</b></font> website of Photographs of Śhrī Mātājī.</p>

<p>The link to the website is: <a href="https://eternalmoments.smugmug.com/"> link</a></p>

<p><b>The search feature serves at least four purposes as follows:</b><br /></p>
<ol>
  <li>One can build its own gallery for the enjoyment of vibrations and blessings.<br /></li>
  <li>To help in identifying untitled (undated or unplaced or unspecified) Photos and photos Moments of Joy.<br /></li>
  <li>To help in identifying unedited or original Photos or photos Moments of Joy so that all edited Photos and photos that are inappropriately circulating on facebook, etc., could be identified, avoided, and hopefully eliminated.<br /></li>
  <li>To help all Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginīs involved in different projects to identify faster the Photos and photos Moments of Joy that would enhance their projects.
The searchable Keywords fall in two categories.<br />
a. coming automatically from the title of the Photos and photos Moments of Joy (such as Evening Program, Public Program, Pūjā, Talk, etc.); 
b. manually added.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>WARNING:</b> 
For a: ONLY Photos uploaded or re-uploaded after November 25, 2021 have the keywords automatically created from the titles (they are in thousands).<br />
For b: We are still working to manually add keywords to the Photos from 255 months of the years 1981 to 2010 and for photos Moments of Joy from the years 1983 to 2011.</p>

<p><b>Very important:</b> none of these keywords, that are automatic or manually added, are on the Photos or photos Moments of Joy (i.e., later on when the download button will be added, via download only the original keywords will be there.</p>

<p>We are constantly working on re-uploading and manually adding keywords, and as such it was felt that it is the right time to start the search feature.</p>

<p><b>Two ways to use the search feature:</b><br />
<i>A (a priori set up search):</i> i. clicking on SEARCH; ii. below the elongated horizontal box choosing the right category (basically Photos or Galleries, in most cases being actually Photos); iii. typing in the elongated horizontal box the keywords that would delimit the search most, the words ought to be separated by space (say, typing: public India)<br />
<i>B (inspired search or seeking to set up a search):</i> i. clicking on any Photo or photo Moments of Joy; ii. clicking on the top left little icon that is an i-circled (Photo Details); iii. From the details lists, click on anyone of the KEYWORDS of that Photo or photo Moments of Joy</p>

<p><b>SUGGESTED KEYWORDS FOR TYPING VIA COPY AND PASTE (to be enlarged):</b><br />
<i>I. Categories:</i> advices, art, comments, conversations, Havan, interview, press, conferences, letter, faxe, marriages, meetings, personality, public, address, talk, Public Program, workshop, Pūjā, quote, message, prayer, story, writing, guideline.<br />
