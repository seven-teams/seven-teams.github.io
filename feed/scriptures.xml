<b>Quotes</b><br />
<font color="red">The-ee ... great writer who is living now in England, his name is Doctor Mascaró, you might have heard his name, he has written lots of treatises about uh-uh Gītā, and Upaniṣhada[s], also Dhammapad, and also Bible. He is a master. And he is a master of Sanskrit language.<br />
I went to see him, and he gave Me a flower, such a beautiful couplet from Gītā, and he said that, ``Mother, give us light. Give them all light so that they can see. Please give them." I said, ``I'm doing that!"<br /> 
I'm doing that, but, somehow, people do not know what to expect within themselves.<br /> 
I'm doing that, but somehow people do not know what to expect within themselves. </font><br />

<br />
<font color="red">In any book whatsoever, take it Bible, or go to Qur'ān, or go to any book, Zen, go to Buddhist, uh-uh-uh books of a Dhammapad, or you go to any other Śhāstras, like Vedas, they have talked of Kuṇḍalinī all right.</font><br />

<br />
<font color="red">Is not like Buddha's time when they had to give up their whole kingdom. Everything to dhamma! Every pā'ī [1/3 of paisā], everything that they had, even their hair, I think. Everything to dhamma! And just come absolutely bare! No children, no wife, no father, nothing! That was Buddhism. That was Buddha's style.<br />
He had His disciples like this, and they used to walk miles together! [They walked] to preach from one place to another in thousands.<br />
What an impression it must be on people, when they see all this.</font><br />
<b>1989-0520 Śhrī Buddha Pūjā, Gautama, The Lord of the Ego, Open Air near El Farell Hotel, Barcelona, Spain </b><br />
<br />
<font color="red">The other day, I was reading about people who are now getting frustrated with Christianity and trying to go to Buddhism or want to go to Islam or anything. They are just the same! There's no difference.<br />
Because what Bible is, or what Christ is, is very different from Christians. What Islam is, is very different from Muslims. That's what all of them admit also. What Buddhism is, is very different from the Buddhist. So what they preach, what they talk about.<br />
The other day, I was reading a book on Islam, I was surprised: is saying the same thing!<br />
Also if you read, say, Buddha, Dhammapad, it says the same thing. Or, these Christian Sciences people, they say the same thing.</font><br />

</p>

<p>
<b>1.1 Translations</b><br />
<font color="DarkGreen">What we are today comes from our thoughts of yesterday, and our present thoughts build our life of tomorrow: our life is the creation of our mind.<br />
If a man speaks or acts with an impure mind, suffering follows him as the wheel of the cart follows the beast that draws the cart.</font><br />
<font color="blue">We are what we think.<br />
All that we are arises with our thoughts.<br />
With our thoughts we make the world. Speak or act with an impure mind<br />
And trouble will follow you<br />
As the wheel follows the ox that draws the cart.</font><br />
<font color="Peru">Mind precedes thoughts, mind is their chief,<br /> 
their quality is made by mind,<br />
if with base mind one speaks or acts<br /> 
through that suffering follows one<br />
like a wheel follows ox’s foot.</font>
</p>

<p>
<b>1.2 Transliteration</b><br />

<b>1.2 Translations</b><br />
<font color="DarkGreen">...... If a man speaks or acts with a pure mind, joy follows him as his own shadow.</font><br />
<font color="blue">...... Speak or act with a pure mind<br />
And happiness will follow you<br />
As your shadow, unshakable.</font><br />

<b>1.4 Transliteration</b><br />
<font color="Peru">"Akkocchi maṁ, avadhi maṁ, ajini maṁ, ahāsi me",<br />

</p>

<p>
<b>1.4 Translations</b><br />
<font color="DarkGreen">'He insulted me, he hurt me, he defeated me, he robbed me.' Those who think not such thoughts will be free from hate.</font><br />
<font color="blue">"Look how he abused me and hurt me,<br /> 
How he threw me down and robbed me."<br />
Abandon such thoughts, and live in love.</font><br />
<font color="DarkGreen">"He abused me, he struck at me,<br /> 
he overcame me, he robbed me,"<br /> 
those who bear not ill-will to others<br /> 
their hatred is surely appeased.</font>

<b>1.5 Transliteration</b><br />
<font color="Peru">Na hi verena verāni sammantīdha kudācanaṁ,<br />

<p>
<b>1.5 Translations</b><br />
<font color="DarkGreen">For hate is not conquered by hate; hate is conquered by love. This is a law eternal.</font><br />
<font color="blue">In this world<br />
Hate never yet dispelled hate.<br />
Only love dispels hate.<br />
This is the law,<br />
Ancient and inexhaustible.</font><br />
<font color="Peru">For not by hatred do hatreds<br />
cease at any time in this place,<br /> 
they only cease with non-hatred,<br /> 
this truth is surely eternal.</font>
</p>

<b>1.6 Transliteration</b><br />
<font color="Peru">Pare ca na vijānanti mayam-ettha yamāmase,<br />
ye ca tattha vijānanti tato sammanti medhagā.</font>
</p>

<p>
<b>1.6 Translations</b><br />
<font color="DarkGreen">Many do not know that we are here in this world to live in harmony. Those who know this do not fight against each other.</font><br />
<font color="blue">You too shall pass away.<br />
Knowing this, how can you quarrel?</font><br />
<font color="Peru">The others do not understand<br />
that we should restrain ourselves here,<br /> 
but for those who do understand,<br /> 
through that, their dissensions do cease.</font>

<p>
<b>1.8 Transliteration</b><br />
<font color="Peru">Asubhānupassiṁ viharantaṁ, indriyesu susaṁvutaṁ,<br /> 
bhojanamhi ca mattaññuṁ, saddhaṁ āraddhavīriyaṁ –<br /> 
taṁ ve nappasahati Māro vāto selaṁ va pabbataṁ.</font>
</p>

<p>
<b>1.8 Translations</b><br />
<font color="DarkGreen">But he who lives not for pleasures, and whose soul is in self-harmony, who eats or fasts with moderation, and has faith and the power of virtue -- this man is not moved by temptations, as a great rock is not shaken by the wind.</font><br />
<font color="blue">The wind cannot overturn a mountain.<br />
Temptation cannot touch the man<br /> 
Who is awake, strong and humble,<br /> 
Who masters himself and minds the dharma.</font><br />
<font color="Peru">Contemplating the unpleasant,<br /> with their sense faculties controlled,<br /> 
and knowing the limit in food,<br /> 
faithful, with energy aroused – Māra does not o’erthrow that one,<br /> 
just as wind does not overthrow<br />
a mountain made of solid rock.</font>
</p>

<p>
<b>1.12 Transliteration</b><br />
<font color="Peru">Sārañ-ca sārato ñatvā, asārañ-ca asārato,<br /> 
te sāraṁ adhigacchanti, sammāsaṅkappagocarā.</font>
</p>

<p>
<b>1.12 Translations</b><br />
<font color="DarkGreen">But those who know the Real is, and know that the unreal is not, they shall reach the Truth, safe on the path of right thought.</font><br />
<font color="blue">See the false as false,<br />
The true as true.<br />
Look into your heart.<br />
Follow your nature.</font><br />
<font color="Peru">Knowing the truth in what is true,<br /> 
and knowing falsehood in the false,<br /> 
they understand what is the truth,<br />

<p>
<b>1.14 Translations</b><br />
<font color="DarkGreen">But even as rain breaks not through a well-thatched house, passions break not through a well-guarded mind.</font><br />
<font color="Peru">Just as rain does not penetrate<br />
a house with thatching that is good,<br /> 
so passion cannot penetrate<br />
a mind that is well-developed.</font>
</p>

<p>
<b>1.16 Transliteration</b><br />
<font color="Peru">Idha modati, pecca modati,<br /> 
katapuñño ubhayattha modati,<br /> 
so modati, so pamodati,<br /> 
disvā kammavisuddhim-attano.</font>
</p>

<p>
<b>1.16 Translations</b><br />
<font color="DarkGreen">...... He is glad, he feels great gladness when he sees the good he has done.</font><br />
<font color="Peru">...... he rejoices, he greatly rejoices, seeing the purity of his own deeds.</font>

katapuñño ubhayattha nandati,<br /> 
"Puññaṁ mĕ katan"-ti nandati,<br /> 
bhiyyo nandati suggatiṁ gato.</font>
</p>

<p>
<b>1.18 Translations</b><br />
<font color="DarkGreen">He rejoices in this world, and he rejoices in the next world: the man who does good rejoices in both worlds. `I have done good', thus he rejoices, and more he rejoices on the path of joy.</font><br />
<font color="blue">Is joyful here and joyful there.<br />
In both worlds he rejoices<br />
And how greatly<br />
When he sees the good he has done.</font><br />
<font color="Peru">Here she delights,<br /> 
after death she delights, the righteous one delights in both places,<br /> 
she delights, thinking: "I have done merit,"<br /> 
gone to a good fate, she delights much more.</font>
</p>

<p>
<b>1.20 Transliteration</b><br />
<font color="Peru">Appam-pi ce sahitaṁ bhāsamāno,<br />
Dhammassa hoti anudhammacārī,<br /> 
rāgañ-ca dosañ-ca pahāya mohaṁ,<br /> 
sammappajāno suvimuttacitto,<br /> 
anupādiyāno idha vā huraṁ vā,<br /> 
sa bhāgavā sāmaññassa hoti.</font>
</p>

<p>
<b>1.20 Translations</b><br />
<font color="DarkGreen">Whereas if a man speaks but a few holy words and yet he lives the life of those words, free from passion and hate and illusion -- with right vision and a mind free, craving for nothing both now and hereafter -- the life of this man is life of a holiness.</font><br />
<font color="blue">Read as few words as you like,<br />
And speak fewer.<br />
But act upon the dharma.<br />
Give up the old ways -<br />
Passion, enmity, folly.<br />
Know the truth and find peace. Share the way.</font><br />
<font color="Peru">Even though reciting only few scriptures,<br /> 
but living in accordance with Dhamma,<br /> 
abandoning greed, hate and delusion,<br /> 
understanding aright, with mind released,<br /> 
that one, unattached here and hereafter,<br /> 
surely partakes of the ascetic life.</font>

<font color="red">The-ee ... great writer who is living now in England, his name is Doctor Mascaró, you might have heard his name, he has written lots of treatises about uh-uh Gītā, and Upaniṣhada[s], also Dhammapad, and also Bible. He is a master. And he is a master of Sanskrit language.<br />
I went to see him, and he gave Me a flower, such a beautiful couplet from Gītā, and he said that, "Mother, give us light. Give them all light so that they can see. Please give them." I said, "I'm doing that!"<br />
I'm doing that, but somehow people do not know what to expect within themselves.</font><br />

<font color="red">People say that, "In Gītā," I haven't read Gītā, "the one who is born in a particular caste belongs to that caste." I say, ``It's not possible."<br />
The author of Gītā, Vedavyās, whose son was he? A fisherwoman's.<br />
The author of Rāmāyaṇa, Vālmīki, who was he? A dacoit who wrote Rāmāyaṇa.<br />
Rāma who ate Śhabarī's berries, Kṛiṣhṇa who had food at Vidura, to understand all these Incarnations we must know that this outward superficiality we have created is all wasteful doings.<br />
We feel secure in all these false ideas we have created, that, `We belong to a certain sect or religion.' All this is a trick of our intellect, our mental projection, which does not spread around but goes only in one direction and then comes back again.<br />
All such beliefs are of adharma and not of dharma, just not possible. Any person who puts another person down, or says, `I am placed higher than others,' can't be right, or in dharma.</font><br />

<font color="red">The Complete Form of Viṣhṇu came to human beings six thousand year[s] back as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. That is at this chakra known as Viśhuddhi chakra.<br />
Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa is the Complete Form. Where ... why do we say the Complete? Because for Him the whole Play, the whole Līlā, was to be just seen. This whole creation was nothing but just a play created.<br />
He had reached that stage, and He talked of it. He said, "Nainaṃ chindanti śhastrāṇi, nainaṃ dahati pāvakaḥ": "You cannot be killed by any instrument, or by anything."<br />
And He did Saṃhāra. His greatest quality was that He killed many demons on this Earth.<br />
Now those who talk of nonviolence will say, 'How? He was a violent man.' There is a Divine Method which has to be employed to kill those demons. That was needed, and He did kill.</font><br />

<font color="red">So-o-o, His purpose was to come on this Earth, on the Āgñyā chakra, as you know that, to open it, and the ... to give a new dimension to our awareness by which we try to understand what Kṛiṣhṇa had said: that, "Nainaṃ chindanti śhastrāṇi, nainaṃ dahati pāvakaḥ." Kṛiṣhṇa had said that, "The Spirit cannot be destroyed, It cannot be killed, It cannot be wiped out, It cannot be blown off." "Na chainaṃ kledayanty āpo, na śhoṣhayati mārutaḥ." "It cannot be sucked in by any air." <br />
And when Kṛiṣhṇa said that, people said, "What sort of a Spirit is that? Where is that Ātmā? What are You talking about? Which One it is?"<br />
So, Christ came on this Earth because He is the essence.<br />
And He showed by His Resurrection that Spirit does not die. And He showed it very clearly what Kṛiṣhṇa had said, because He was, you know, He was Kṛiṣhṇa's Son, and that's how He did it.<br /> 
But before He could deliver the complete thing to human beings they crucified Him. And that is ... mhh ... that is [laughing:] the way they respected Him and that is the way they came to Him.</font><br />

And it has also been described that Kṛiṣhṇa has bestowed upon Christ His sixteenth right. That is, Christ would become the Support of the World and show the people what Kṛiṣhṇa had said, "Nainaṃ chindanti śhastrāṇi, nainaṃ dahati pāvakaḥ, Na chainaṃ kledayanty āpo, na śhoṣhayati mārutaḥ."

<font color="red">Then we come to Āgñyā chakra, which is the Light Itself. That is the one that enlightens your attention, Āgñyā chakra. That is the Light by which you see everything, after Realization. And when you know you are the Light, and when you know that you are the Eternal Light, that nothing can kill you: "Nainaṃ chindanti śhastrāṇi, nainaṃ dahati pāvakaḥ."<br /> 
Once you know that in your Āgñyā, then all the fears and domination disappear [snapping Her fingers:] just like that. Because it is the Light of Love that does not dominate nor is afraid because it knows it is eternal, it is not afraid of death or of crucifixion or of anything.</font><br />

<font color="red">Uh [laughing:] only trouble with Sahaja Yogis is that they take things [a] little lightly. Of course, that is their character. But not Sahaja Yoga. Other things you can take lightly: if somebody shouts at you, somebody gets angry with you, somebody even slaps you, take it lightly. Doesn't matter. Makes no difference to you. Because you are the Spirit: nothing can destroy the Spirit. "Nainaṃ chindanti śhastrāṇi" ["Weapons do not cut It": first part of the first verse of Bhagavad Gītā 2.23].<br />
But when it comes to Sahaja Yoga, your attitude should be different. If you are relaxing on one side, another side you have to be dynamic. And that side is: where you have to put forward the theories of Sahaja Yoga, and you have to talk to people, you have to organize a press conference, or whatever sort of things you want to do.</font><br />

<b>2.47 Quotes</b><br />
<font color="red">So many people I have met who tell Me that, "Mātājī, I only perform my karmas and the fruit I leave at the Lotus Feet of God." You will find these kind of self-satisfied people a lot.<br />
It is not possible. This is diplomacy.<br />
What is the essence of diplomacy? Let Me tell you the essence of diplomacy which is that, 'Put the absurd condition in front.' A person will fall trap into his own web.<br />
Now, see the play of the words here where He said that, "You do your karma and leave the fruit at the feet of God." It's an impossible situation where this is an absurd condition.<br />
Now human being is trying to do it like stupid. All right, keep on doing. Unless and until you are [<font color="orange">unclear</font> detached/broken], until your karma becomes akarma, until you become empty from within, this can't be achieved because ego and superego are sitting on your head. Whatever you will do it will be either by the force of ego or by superego.<br />
So how can you surrender to God unless you have a connection with God?<br />
He in fact said: "Karmaṇy-evādhikāras te mā phaleṣhu kadāchana." Kṛiṣhṇa said this and that too by putting this absurd condition because it's not easy to get human beings to the right understanding.<br />
I am watching that even after six thousand years the situation is still the same.</font><br />

<font color="red">For karma, He said: that, "Do all the work and put it at the Lotus Feet of God Almighty." 
That's not possible. Many people say: that, "Mother, all my work, I put at the Lotus Feet of God." Even the murders, I think! [Smiles.] It['s] just a mental idea: that, 'I am putting it at the Lotus Feet of God.' You cannot! Because you are not at that state.<br />
But say, a Sahaja Yogi, he will not tell Me, that 'I am raising the Kuṇḍalinī,' he'll say, 'Mother, it doesn't come up. Is not coming, it ...', in the third person he talks. He will say: 'This won't go that side,' in the third person. Because he is no more there.<br />
So, this is what is the karma: automatically is at the Lotus Feet of God Almighty, if He is doing everything! We are just instruments!</font><br />

<font color="red">The second one was the karma, that you do your work. You go on doing your work, with a 'detached mind'. I mean it's not possible, but that's what they say. And we are doing our karmas, good karmas, we do all kinds of good things, go to various places for our cleansing, meet many great people of spirituality, go to all various places, and pray. Visit all auspicious places which are being described, all kinds of rituals, we do for that.<br />
That is the ... Karma Yoga.<br />
And that is what: the Karma Yoga, according to us, is the right side.<br />
Many people, as you know, are right-sided. Right-sided people are the people who are, as you know, full of ego, arrogance, and think no end of themselves. Very difficult to correct them. They also never see anything wrong with them. Whichever way they act, they think, 'Is all right.'<br />
That is the Karma Yoga.<br />
But He has said that: "Whatever karmas you do, whatever its fruits are, that you cannot say." He said it in a very uncertain manner. Because, definitely, if He had said it with certainty, people would never have understood Him. So He said: "It's not possible! That whatever karmas you are doing could be the karmas which will get you the blessings of the Divine." "Karmaṇy-evādhikāras te phaleṣhu mā kadāchana" [mā phaleṣhu" reversed], He has said it.<br />
So then, 'Which karmas we should do? Or should we give up all the karmas? All the action, we should give up?' People were in two minds.<br />
This is the style of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa: is to put people in two minds, so they use their discretion.</font><br />

<b>2.55 Quotes</b><br />
<font color="red">So at this time, what is your first job is to try to be more exposed to Me, so that automatically you'll go into your sattvaguṇa. This is the best!<br />
But if I am not there, and when you are alone, or when you are with other Sahaja Yogis, you must now compete in rising higher and higher: from tamoguṇa to rajoguṇa, and from rajoguṇa to sattvaguṇa.<br />
But, actually, by Realization you have gone beyond these three guṇas. You have gone beyond it. Actually that is what has happened to you.<br />
But, like clouds, they cover you again and again.<br />
And when the sky is covered with those clouds, you cannot see the sun, you cannot see the moon, you cannot see the stars.<br />
So we have to know how these clouds are coming into us. And that's how we go into our complete analysis: 'How these clouds are coming to us?'<br />
You find out about our different chakras: 'What are the chakras we are catching?' Here comes the another constant attention towards our chakras. 'Are our vibrations all right or not? Are we getting our vibrations? If not, what chakra am I catching? What must be the catch? I must raise my Kuṇḍalinī, see for myself, where is the catch. Do I do my meditation or not? If I do it, am I doing it just dozingly or am I ... am I really in it? Am I really feeling it or not? Am I alert or not?'<br />
All this is to be assiduously, sincerely, absolutely, truthfully should be worked out. Because it is a process between your Self: "Ātmane evātmanā tuṣhṭaḥ." You see, it's so very funny, it is so funny relationship: that it is the Ātmā is satisfied with Ātmā! You have to be satisfied with your Self.<br />
There's nobody, Mātājī is not concerned, nobody is concerned. It is you [that] are concerned with your Self. </font><br />

If it is some Sādhu then it's all right. "Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṃ vināśhāya cha duṣhkṛutām."<br />

<b>9.22 Translations</b><br />
<font color="Peru">Those men who, meditating on Me as non-separate, worship Me all around, -- to them who are ever devout, I secure gain and safety.</font><br />
<font color="blue">Those people who, thinking on Me with singleness of purpose, offer service unto Me, and who are constantly putting forth effort (in that service); for their sake I take upon myself (the burthen of all) earning, and saving.</font><br />
<font color="DarkGreen">But to those who adore me with pure oneness of soul, to those who are ever in harmony, I increase what they have and I give them what they have not.</font>

<b>9.22 Quotes</b><br />
<font color="red">We sometimes ask for worldly things, power, money: you are still entangled in little things.<br />
The Supreme Self that I am talking of is all seeing. "Yogakṣhemaṁ vahāmyaham": Yoga and kṣhema are looked after by Him.<br /> See now, there is nothing superior to Him in this world. What in this world can stand in comparison to the Lord‽ The entire world is functioning because of this Superior Entity.</font><br />

<font color="red">Looking at his country, of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, when we torture women in the name of religion are we capable of us being Indians? We go on trumpeting about Indian culture. But are we capable of calling ourselves where we go out [abroad] and project ourselves about burning and killing our daughters-in-law? And so the outsiders say that, `Your country is such spiritual place, so much knowledge is there, people talk about righteousness and lecture about it, then how is it so that such horrible events happen?' What answer do we have on this?<br />
Only one answer is there, that Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa has said, "Yogakṣhemaṁ vahāmyaham."<br />
There is a catch in this. `First there should be Yoga, and then I will look after their benevolence.' Why Did He not say, 'Kṣhema-yoga'?<br />
First there will be Yoga, and then benevolence. This is the depiction of dharma. So first you achieve your Yoga.<br />
So if you glorify the Indian culture, then the most essential and important essence of this culture is that you achieve your Self-realization.</font><br />

<br />
<font color="red">But the second thing He said, that, you should do [laughing:] bhakti: "Whatever fruit or flower or water you give Me, I'll take it. But you must do bhakti which is ananya."<br />
Now if you know Sanskrit, ananya: when you are not the other. When you are a realized Soul!<br />
If you are not connected, what is the bhakti on you? Many people complain: "Mother, I have been fasting, I have been doing this, I did this, and see my condition. I've become a nervous wreck." Is not the mistake of God: you are not yet connected.<br />
Is-s, simple thing like a telephone: is [if] the telephone is not connected, wha[t']s the use of telephoning? You spoil the telephone.<br />
So, bhakti without the connection is wrong. That's why Kṛiṣhṇa has said it: "Yogakṣhemaṁ vahāmyaham": "First Yog, then kṣhema." First you must achieve your Yoga, and then your benevolence will come. Otherwise, it won't work out.<br />
Very subtly He has put Yoga first. Why didn't He say, 'Kṣhema-yoga'?<br />
So, for bhakti He said like this.</font><br />

<b>18.66 Quotes</b><br />
<font color="red">Today I am openly telling you. As long as you do not accept Me, this work will not be done. This thing I did not say earlier.<br />
Like Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa said, "Sarva dharmān paritajya Mām ekam śharaṇam vraja," the same is My saying.<br />
As Christ had said, "I am the Light, I am the Path," same is My statement, "I am the Destination, not only the Path."<br />
I did not say this to you because I had very bad experiences. This is the only reason. You people have to come to My refuge (śharaṇāgat). You have to accept Me as Mother and live like My sons. Without that your work will not be done.</font><br />

......<br />
<font color="red">Kṛiṣhṇa has said in His Gītā, kī [that], "Sarva-dharmān parityajya Mām ekaṃ śharaṇaṃ vraja." "Forget about all your dharmas." Dharma means in His meaning that we have a dharma of a wife, of a husband, of a uh-uh-uh-uh member of the society, all of them have their own dharma. But He says, "Leave them! And leave it them to Me, and I'll manage."<br />
This is it, we have to learn: is to say that, 'Is this Divine Power which will solve our problems.'<br />
As human beings, it's a very difficult state.<br />
And this state only can be achieved through meditation. But I am say... not saying that you go on meditating for hours altogether: not necessary. But with full faith in yourself and in the Divine Power, if you work it out, I'm sure, is not difficult to rise to that state of consciousness. </font><br />

<font color="red">So much has been said in the Qur'ān. My father who translated the Qur'ān has mentioned it, which I have read.<br />
The whole of Namāz depicts the awakening of Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
And in it, He mentioned Allah hu Akbar, that Akbar is Himself Śhrī Virāṭa.<br />

<font color="red">So, it is all described iking uh-uhb uh Qur'ān. There's a complete Sūrah describing about the Sent One, means the Avatāra, means the Incarnation. And also said that, "You won't believe," "You won't accept," and all those things.  </font><br />

<br />
<font color="red">Even in the Islam they showed Me a complete Sūrah written about Me, that the Sent One, they call Me a Sent One, and, 'That person will give you Realization, that would make you Pīrs, that will give you Collective Consciousness,' everything written in that, so beautiful, you won't believe it.

<br />
<font color="red">The other day, I was reading about people who are now getting frustrated with Christianity and trying to go to Buddhism or want to go to Islam or anything. They are just the same! There's no difference.<br />
Because what Bible is, or what Christ is, is very different from Christians. What Islam is, is very different from Muslims. That's what all of them admit also. What Buddhism is, is very different from the Buddhist. So what they preach, what they talk about.<br />
The other day, I was reading a book on Islam, I was surprised: is saying the same thing!<br />
Also if you read, say, Buddha, Dhammapad, it says the same thing. Or, these Christian Sciences people, they say the same thing.</font><br />

<font color="red">Muhammad Sāheb, who was a great personality, said, "At the Time of your Resurrection, your hands will speak," which is known as Qiyāmah, the Resurrection Time.</font><br />

<font color="red">Like there's one boy who has fished out lots of things from Qur'ān, [he] is German, from Qur'ān, what it has to say for Sahaj.<br />
And they said, "Thes ... there is a Sūrah called Saishta [Śhāsti] Yoga, Saishta [Śhāsti] Yoga" [Sūrah 36: Yāʾ-Sīn], and that Sūrah is dealing with Me. Because eve... will be ... it is said that: "We are going to send, and the Sent, the One who is sent, will not be acceptable to you. You will deny, you will defy." Everything is described. Even, that's, "Your hands will speak," at the Time  of your Resurrection, all that in that Sūrah is given. It's very interesting, that Sūrah is.</font><br />

<font color="red">Whatever is said about the Last Judgment, this is the time for that Last Judgment.<br />
Also in Qur'ān it is said: that, "At the Time of your Resurrection, your hands will speak, and they will give witness against you." Exactly this happens in Sahaja Yoga. The Sūrah that is in Qur'ān called as Sashtī [Śhāsti] Yoga [Sūrah 36: Yāʾ-Sīn], is surprising how Muhammad Sāhab clearly said about it.</font><br />

<br />
<font color="red">In the Qur'ān there is one beautiful Sūrah called Saishta [Śhāsti] Yoga [Sūrah 36: Yāʾ-Sīn]. In that they have described all about it, that, "Your hands will speak, at the Time of your Resurrection. And they will give witness against you."</font><br />
<b>1990-0319 Public Program, Canberra, Australia</b><br />
<br />
<font color="red">In Qur'ān, there's a Sūrah [36] called Ee uh-uh-uh ... Yāʾsīn, meaning ... they say that Yoga Sajadā [Prayer] is the name of that one, in which Muhammad Sāhab has clearly described: "At the Time of Resurrection, your hands will speak."<br />
Now, if Muhammad Sāhab was the last Man [see 33:40], why did He talk of Resurrection? Why did He talk of the future? Why did He say, "Your hands will speak"?</font><br />

<p>We would like to begin the scriptures’ posts with a collection of quotes from Shri Lao Tze and Shri Confucius, two primordial masters who incarnated in present day China, around 500 BC.</p>

<p><strong><em>“The Primordial Master is always placed in looking after our Void, in sustaining us, and giving us a model of an ideal master…Confucius has taught the humanity how we can improve our relations with other human beings. But Lao-Tse in China has very beautifully described Tao, meaning the Kundalini.” - Shri Mataj Nirmala Devi</em></strong></p>
