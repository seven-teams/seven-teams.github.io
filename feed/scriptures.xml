<b>Quotes</b><br />
<font color="red">Śhrī Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya lived in sixth century A.D. He wrote many texts: Saundaryalaharī, Upadeśhasāhasri, Vivekachūḍāmaṇi, Ātmabodh, etc. In most of these texts, there are various references to Kuṇḍalinī awakening, as some of the following stanzas [10 and 9 from Saundaryalaharī] will illustrate:<br />
[Having in-filled in the pathway of the nāḍīs with the streaming shower of Nectar flowing from Thy pair of Feet (Lotus Feet), having resumed Thine own position from out of resplendent lunar regions, and Thyself assuming the form of a serpent of three and a half coils, sleepest Thou in the hollow of the Kulakuṇḍa.] [Kulakuṇḍa=the hollow of the Mūlādhāra -- sacrum bone.]<br />
[Thou art diverting (residing) in secrecy with Thy Lord (the Spirit) in the thousand-petalled Lotus, having pierced through the Earth situated in Mūlādhāra, the Water in the Maṇipūra, the Fire abiding in the Swādhiṣhṭhāna, the Air in the Heart (Anāhata), the Ether above (the Viśhuddhi) and Manas between the eyebrows (Āgñyā) and thus broken the entire Kula path.]<br />
Śhrī Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya propounded that it is the Kuṇḍalinī who has to be awakened and unless and until you get your Realization you are nowhere near religion. Śhrī Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya also had given a very befitting answer to the so-called proponents of Haṭha Yoga, Gyān Yoga, Karma Yoga or Rāj Yoga. "Neither by Yoga, nor philosophy, nor by work, nor by learning but by the Realization of one's identity with the Brahman is liberation possible and by no other means. </font><br />

<br />
<font color="red">What you have to get? Is Collective Consciousness, which is called in the Sanskrit language Sāmūhik Chetanā.<br />
It's written all over!<br />
Now, if you have to listen to anyone, you go and read Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, He was the last word, in His book Vivekachūḍāmaṇi.</font><br />

<br />
<font color="red">Imagine: they challenged Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya I must say. When He wrote His Vivekachūḍāmaṇi, they got after His life. So He gave up everything. He said, "All right. I will just sing the praise of the Mother, finished! I'm not going to talk." He was very clever man though.</font><br />

<br />
<font color="red">The second person who was very well equipped with this knowledge, was Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya who has written many books. The first book He wrote was Vivekachūḍāmaṇi, in which He describes this fourth dimension and explains why we should try to attain this fourth dimension. An intellectual, one Mister Sharma, challenged Him and told Him that, "He could not do anything as an ascetic and win over my intellect." Thus He felt that for the common people all this discussion might just seem to be mental acrobatics. So He decided to write books just praising the Primordial Mother, especially in Saundaryalaharī, where He described all the Divine Vibrations as the vibrations of the loving beauty of the Primordial Mother. At that time all this was written in the Sanskrit language but the common people did not understand this language, except for a very few learned people, who also did not want to go into the details of this exposition.</font><br />

<font color="red">Now we will talk about Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya.<br />
Hindus have not done anything except ridiculing great people.<br />
He said, "Na Yogen na Sāṅkhyen": "You will not get it in any other way, you will get it only through Mother's grace."<br />
He has written a great book Vivekachūḍāmaṇi, a book full of wisdom. He has shown His wisdom in the book. Later, He described only His Mother in the book.<br />
People asked Him, "Why are You praising [the] Mother?" He said, "There is no other cure, this is everything. All the mantras are in this."</font><br />

<b>Quotes</b><br />
<font color="red">References to Kuṇḍalinī awakening abound in many of the Indian Scriptures. Some of these are Vāsiṣhṭha Yoga, Ṛigveda, Puruṣha Sūkta, Upaniṣhads of Atharvaveda, Yogopanishad, Yogaśhikhā Upaniṣhad, Kaṭhopaniṣhad and Yoga Kuṇḍalinī Upaniṣhad. In the Purāṇas are Devī Bhāgavat[am] Purāṇa, Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa, Śhrī Bhāgavat[a] Purāṇa, etc. In Sanhitas: Haṭh[a] Yoga Sanhita, Laya Yoga Sanhita, Rāj Yoga Sanhita, Śhiv Sanhita. In the Yoga tests: Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā, Saundaryalaharī, Śhubhodayam, Lalitā Sahasrānam, and by Saints such as Bhakt Kabīr, Nāṇak, Gyāneśhwar, etc.</font><br />
<b>1900-0000 Quote from the book Divine Knowledge through Vibrations (1992) by P.T. Rajasekharan and R. Venkatesan, Pages 73 and 74</b><br />
<br />
<font color="red">Above this chakra is the Āgñyā chakra, which is a very, very important chakra, which is the Door, which is the Door of the Sahasrāra. At the Āgñyā chakra resides Mahāviṣhṇu.<br />
Those who have read about Mahāviṣhṇu, in the Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa or in the Devī Bhāgavat[am], you will know what I am talking about. But you will not know when He incarnated and who He was.<br />
He was nobody else but Jesus Christ.</font><br />

<br />
<font color="red">If you read the Devī Bhāgavat[am] although you do not read such things, if you read Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇ, all such things are mentioned in it. His name was Mahāviṣhṇu. His Father was none other than Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, the Virāṭ. The person He keeps talking about, His Father, is Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.</font><br />

<br />
<font color="red">Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, of course, the greatest son of our country has described it so elaborately, but those who call themselves also Hindus, do they know the word Kuṇḍalinī? While throughout in the Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇ, such a Great Sage, the one who has not read the Mārkaṇḍeya, I would not call him an Indian at all.<br />
One of the greatest Sages of this country is Mārkaṇḍeya who has written a complete knowledge about the Devī to such a little extent, to such a small detail that you will be so surprised, `How He could see all these things? Did He enter into the body of Devī to find out these small small minute things?' </font><br />
<b>1979-0328 Public Address, Inauguration of The Advent (Guḍhī Pāḍavā Day), FICCI Auditorium, 1 Tansen Mārg, New Delhi, India from Anant Jeevan, Issue 1 (July 1979), Pages 5--12</b><br />
<br />
<font color="red">Two Great Powers are combined in Jesus Christ. The first Power is that of Śhrī Gaṇeśha, who is recognized as His Original Power, and the other is that of Śhrī Kārttikeya.<br />
Because of this, the Incarnation of Jesus Christ is of complete Brahman Tattwa or Oṃkār.<br />
Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, He being the Father of Jesus Christ, bestowed a number of boons on Jesus Christ prior to His birth.<br />
One of these boons was that, ``You would dwell on a plane higher than that of mine."<br />
This could be explained to mean, that while the plane of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa is the Viśhuddhi chakra, located at the base of our neck, the plane of Jesus is Āgñyā chakra, which is located at the junction of the optic thalamus.<br />
The second boon granted by Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was that, ``You would be the support of the whole universe."<br />
The third boon was, that, ``You would be the first to receive one-sixteenth part of all the offerings made to Me in Pūjā."<br />
In this way, after bestowing a number of boons, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa permitted Śhrī Jesus Christ to incarnate on the Earth.<br />
You would understand these things better, if you read `Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa'. Śhrī Mārkaṇḍeya, the author of the Purāṇa has beautifully explained a number of such subtler points.<br />
In the same Purāṇa, there is a graphic description of Śhrī Mahāviṣhṇu. If you would listen to this description while in meditation, you would notice that the description is of Jesus Christ only.</font><br />

<b>Auṃ! Reverence to the Adorable Viṣhṇu</b><br />
<font color="DarkGreen">May Viṣhṇu's Lotus Feet, which power have<br />
To dissipate the woes wrought by the fear<br />
Of existence, ......<br />
......<br />
...... may those same Feet,<br />
Whose steps the earth, the sky, and heaven o'erpassed,<br />
To sight appearing, purify your souls!</font><br />
<br />
<font color="DarkGreen">May He protect you, who is skilled to save<br />
In every kind of sin impure; whose form<br />
Within the bosom of the sea of milk<br />
Upon the hooded snake reclines; and at<br />
Whose touch the sea grows mountainous, its spray<br />
Up-tossing from its waters by his breath<br />
Disturbed, and into seeming dancing breaks!</font><br />

<b>Quotes</b><br />
<font color="red">Guru Nāṇak Dev has made lot of references to Kuṇḍalinī awakening in the sacred book, Śhrī Guru Granth Sāhib. Kuṇḍalinī has been referred to as Surati and Daśham Dwār [Tenth Door], means Brahmarandhra or opening up of anterior fontanel area on Kuṇḍalinī awakening.</font><br />
<b>1900-0000 Two Quotes from the book Divine Knowledge through Vibrations (1992) by P.T. Rajasekharan and R. Venkatesan, Page 77</b><br />
<br />
<font color="red">These brief reviews [stanzas from Śhrī Guru Granth Sāhib] illustrate that the theme of Kuṇḍalinī awakening referred to variously as Rebirth, Resurrection, [True] Baptism, Union with Divine, Tao [of Lao Tze], is common throughout mankind's history in all the religions of the world. In fact, this is the essence of all the religions, though because of time and place constraints, it was kept a hidden science in the past.</font><br />
<b>1900-0000 Quote from the book Divine Knowledge through Vibrations (1992) by P.T. Rajasekharan and R. Venkatesan, Page 78</b><br />
<br />
<font color="red">During the times of Guru Nāṇaka, He felt that all kinds of men are printing. He understood that. So He made Guru Grantha Sāhib using books of only realized Souls of that time. He said, "Not to read anything else. Whatever is written in it, follow that."<br />
But you all know how they manipulated this Grantha.<br />
Bible was written, it was manipulated. Qur'ān was written, it is also manipulated.</font><br />

<font color="red">There was a boy, a Sikh boy who came to see Me. He was a very good boy. He came to see Me and he said that, "Mother, ah we are all followers [of] Guru Nāṇak, but somehow I am not convinced about the way Sikhism is going on. And uh Kabīra has said uh in our Granth Sāhab that, 'You should get your Realization,' and I haven't got it. Then how long are we to go on taking the name of God?" And I was surprised at his alertness about thing, that you have to have the experience of God. I said, "All right, it's a very good idea." And the he got his Realization. He is a young boy, very young boy.<br />
But when he got it, just like, 'Eureka! Eureka!', he went to his people. He told all the Sikh people, "What are you doing here? Come along! There is a way, what Mu [Guru] Nāṇaka has said! There is a way to get it. Why don't you get it all of you?" And he brought so many! And he used to speak! People said, "Mother, we could not believe this boy could speak!" They said he used to speak so well and whatever he had heard, you know. He said that, "I, eaty [every] day [they] used to read knuh Grantha Sāhab" to him when ... He said, "I was half asleep. I used to be tired. They would read two and half days continuously, I would be tired. But somehow, all these things that they read, they came to Me." And I ... he would recite all these poems and everything, and he was telling about how Nāṇaka was saying about Sahaj Yoga. People were amazed at his thing. And so many Sikh people came to Me because of him. Own, his own father, mother, everybody.</font><br />

<br />
<font color="red">The way Kabīra lashes people, you can see that He is tremendous! He is like Bhairava.<br />
And the Power of Bhairava, Kabīra has used in His language, but for Hindi poets it is Sadhukaddi [vernacular dialect of Hindi+Punjabi+Māravāṛī in medieval North India] and they have made fun of it.<br />
The best thing of a person who doesn't want to face reality, is to make fun of everyone. That is the best way.<br />
They said, "What is this talk, 'Iḍā, Piṅgalā, Suṣhumṇā'? Who is He? What does He think of Himself?" But He was appreciated, very much, by the Saints and specially by Guru Nāṇaka, who included all His poetry in His Grantha Sāhab.<br />
He's included so many of these poetry from all the realized Souls from Ma... Maharashtra, also.</font><br />

<b>Quotes</b><br />
<font color="red">This is Yin and Yang, is, if you see these two are Yin and Yeng [Yang]. And what is described in the martial arts is, is actually later on followed by it. But actually Zen is nothing, Zen means meditation. Zen, Zen means meditation. And, you see, the description even of Lao Tze of Tao is the same of the Kuṇḍalinī rising. You see, the Yangtze River, I've gone through that, you see, and it's really the description of the Kuṇḍalinī Itself how It raises, and Tao is nothing but the Kuṇḍalinī. He's describes that. The name is different. But Ta-o means the Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
Now, these are the two things which are in our brain, you see, really placed like that, Yin and Yang. You see there, if you cut your heads transverse you will find these two things placed like that, this Yin and Yang. And this is what Zen was talking about. </font><br />
<b>1985-0303 Public Program, Adelaide, SA, Australia</b><br />
<br />
<font color="red">You must know that whosoever talking to you, should traditionally talk about religion. He should integrate all the religions. He should integrate all the Incarnations, all the Saints who have come on this Earth. All the truth of the world should be brought it, like Tao should be there, Zen should be there, there should be Christ, there should be Muhammad, and there should be Kṛiṣhṇa and Rāma. All of Them are relations of each other. </font><br />

<font color="red">In all, the Tao is nothing but the Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
Zen is also dealing with Kuṇḍalinī.</font><br />

<b>Quotes</b><br />
<font color="red">And after many Incarnations on this Earth, They gave Realization to some people, but very few. And then these people later on started giving Realization to others.<br />
We can say that this all started with Paraśhurāma. When Paraśhurāma was incarnated it was the beginning of individual spirituality. People started learning spirituality by going individually to the forest. But Paraśhurāma was [an] Incarnation.<br />
And with Paraśhurāma, Śhrī Ādi Guru Dattātreya had also many Incarnations. But due to Śhrī Dattātreya's collaboration in Śhrī Paraśhurāma's Incarnation, one in karoṛs or lākhs used to get his Realization.<br />
And after this, He also used to sit in the forest. He was next to the Incarnation. People used to get cured by going to Him in case of need. They thought, 'He is a Saint, we should pay our respects to Him.'</font><br />

<br />
<font color="red">The first one is Śhrī Lalitā, the Goddess Śhrī Lalitā, which is the Goddess of Beauty. She is the joy-giving: Sarvānandamayā. Gives the joy from everything. In every created world, in every particle, in every form, there is a power which gives us joy. This power is the Joy ... is the Power of Śhrī Lalitā. She is called as Mahā Tripurasundarī. Parā-parā Ati Rahasyā Yoginī. Means: Parā-parā Ati Rahasyā, the One who knows the secrets. The Parā-parā means: the One that is beyond of the beyond. The secrets of that area, the One who knows is Śhrī Lalitā, who is the Yoginī. At this stage, She is Bindu Sarvānandamayā: She is the Dot which is joy-giving.<br />
Second power, or āvaraṇ, means the enclosure, is like a triangle. She is Sarvasidhhipradā. She is the One who gives all the siddhis. She has got three sides. She's called as Tripurāmbā: Kāmeśhwarī, Buddhvajreśhwarī, Bhagamālinī are the three Yoginīs.<br />
Third one is called as Atharva Sarvarogahara, this is another enclosure. The name of the Goddess is Tripurasiddhā Ati Rahasyā, meaning: these Goddesses know the deep secrets of all the siddhis. The chakra is called as Sarvarogahara, and the enclosure is called as Aṣhṭār.</font><br />

<br />
<font color="red">His sixth form was as the Strong Man (Paraśhurāma). He brought forth the powers achieved by self-control (<i>tapobala</i>). When they were fully evolved human beings developed their `I'-ness and felt a need to seek the unknown within themselves. They began to think about God, and became aware of the strengths of spiritual life, and started a new search of the inner life. The search was an individual one, and the seeker absolutely secluded himself from society. Many renounced the world and went into complete retreat in the forests and jungles in search of the Ultimate Reality, often pursuing their quest day and night for years on end, and often for life after life. Paraśhurāma was the founder of Haṭha and Rāja Yoga which were practiced all alone under the guidance of a guru.</font><br />
<b>The Book of Ādi Śhakti, Chapter 2: Divine Incarnations -- Ambassadors of God, Page 32</b><br />
<br />
<font color="red">Ādi Śhakti incarnated as Durgā a thousand times to protect such Saints, and apart from these full Incarnations She also manifested Her Powers through many chaste women of India in a partial form (<i>Aṃśhāvatāra</i>). The Incarnation of Ādi Viṣhṇu as Paraśhurāma. (the Strong Man) created an awareness of the techniques of physical and mental powers. Seekers discovered many new methods of meditation through such discoveries. </font><br />

</p>

<p>
<b>1.1 Comment</b><br />
<font color="DarkGreen">...... Parameśhwarī who, in Her crystal purity, displays the variegated phenomena which gyrate in equipoise within Her.</font>
</p>

<p>
<b>1.2 Translation</b><br />
<font color="DarkGreen">[Haritāyana:] "Undisturbed you have heard, O Nārada! the Māhātmya (The Gospel) [Māhātmya Khanda or Haritāyana Saṃhitā Section 1] of Śhrī Tripurā, which teaches the way to transcendence."</font>

<p>
<b>1.3 Translation</b><br />
<font color="DarkGreen">I shall now discourse on wisdom, which is unique because one will be permanently freed from misery, by hearing it.</font>
</p>

<p>
<b>1.4 Translation</b><br />
<font color="DarkGreen">This is the concentrated extract of the essence of the Vedic, Vaishnava, Saiva, Satkta and Pasupata lore taken after a deep study of them all.</font>
</p>

<p>
<b>1.5-7 Translation</b><br />
<font color="DarkGreen">No other course will impress the mind so much as this one on Wisdom which was once taught by that Illustrious Master Dattātreya to Paraśhurāma. The teaching was born on His own experience, logical in sense and quite unique in its nature. One who cannot apprehend Truth even after hearing this must be dismissed as a silly fool to be ranked among the insentient and accursed of God; Śhiva Himself cannot make such a one gain wisdom.</font>
</p>

<p>
<b>1.8 Translation</b><br />
<font color="DarkGreen">...... Oh, the lives of sages are most sacred!</font>
</p>

<p>
<b>1.9-11 Translation</b><br />
<font color="DarkGreen">Nārada too served me to learn the same from me; for, service to Sages enables one to apprehend their innate kindness, ......<br />
As Paraśhurāma, the son of Jamadagni, already pure-minded and pleasing to all, was listening to the Gospel [Māhātmya] of Tripurā from the lips of Dattātreya, He became abstracted in devotion and so growing still for a time, His mind became still purer.</font>
</p>

<p>
<b>1.9-11 Comment</b><br />
Jamadagni is one of the Saptarṣhi [Seven Sages].

<b>1.12-13 Translation</b><br />
<font color="DarkGreen">Then as the mind relaxed, His eyes glowed in rapture and His hair stood on end, as if His ecstasy could not be contained within but must escape through the very pores of His body. He then fell to the ground before His master Dattā.</font>
</p>

<p>
<b>1.14 Translation</b><br />
<font color="DarkGreen">Again He rose, and being filled with ecstasy, His voice choked with emotion and He said: "Lucky am I; blessed am I; through Thy Grace, O Lord!"</font>

I went to see him, and he gave Me a flower, such a beautiful couplet from Gītā, and he said that, "Mother, give us light. Give them all light so that they can see. Please give them." I said, "I'm doing that!"<br />

<b>Seeker:</b> But the Lord Buddha said, "Now, birth is suffering, death is suffering."<br />
<font color="red"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b> Yeah's, that's true. But not Realization. [Some laughter.]<br />
You see, what He has said is: Buddha had it asked you to limit your desire, of ascent.<br />
Because people talked of God, once they talked of, in India for example, they talked of the Deities. That was a problem, because it became a talk again. Then they talked to God uh-uh-uh ... God which was ab ... abstract, uh-uh-uh like you can say Jehovah, and other things, because they wanted people to uh-uh-uh get over their uh-uh-uh st... stuck up points, you see. Nothing worked, you see!<br />
So Buddha said, "All right, let's talk only about the Self-realization, nothing else. Not even of God: let's talk of that only! Let people get to Self-realization, then we'll talk about God." So He said, "All right: only Self-realization! No God, nothing!" That was His job: to fix you up with the idea of Self-realization. He said, "Don't worship anything, don't do anything, get your Self-realization!"<br />
They are worshiping every-thing under the sun, this Buddhist! What am I to do?<br />
So whatever Buddha has said, is, everything is re-said in Sahaja Yoga.<br />
"Buddham śharaṇaṃ gacchāmi." "I surrender myself to the Enlightened One." The one which is enlightened is your Spirit.<br />
"Saṅghaṃ śharaṇaṃ gacchāmi": "I surrender myself to the collectivity."<br />
Unless and until you are a collectively conscious person, how can you surrender?<br />
Buddha also, whatever He said, is not understood before Realization. You cannot.<br />
"Dharmam śharaṇaṃ gacchāmi": is the sustenance within you.<br />
Śharaṇaṃ means you become that! Is not a mental thing, 'Oh, I surrender myself!' But you just become!<br />
You become the Enlightened One, you become the collectively conscious, you become the dharma, the sustenance, the religion within us. You become! That's what He meant.<br />
But for them, "śharaṇaṃ gacchāmi," means take a wheel in the hand, go on, "Buddham śharaṇaṃ gacchāmi," now [puts the right hand on Her forehead]. What this wheel is going to do I just don't understand, you know! They go on [for] hours together: they'll go mad! They will end up into lunatic asylum, believe Me!<br />
Or like mad, you are saying something, all the time praying: is that the way you are becoming?<br />
They don't even know where is Buddha placed within yourself!<br />
But Sahaja Yogis know where He is placed and how to please Him.<br />
Whatever He'd said is nothing but Sahaja Yoga, absolutely, hundred percent!<br />
Actually Buddha was nobody else but an Incarnation, who reincarnated Himself as Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya. You can see it clearly that it was He! And can be proved on Kuṇḍalinī again! You see, how can I prove it‽<br />
To understand Them, first you get your Realization.<br />
Again, I am talking like Buddha only!<br />
He tried some things, by which He thought people would take to Realization, with human beings, as they are. He thought, 'They are very much involved in materialism, take them out. Try this, try that,' nothing works out. 'Not this!' </font><br />

Everything to dhamma! And just come absolutely bare! No children, no wife, no father, nothing! That was Buddhism. That was Buddha's style.<br />
He had His disciples like this, and they used to walk miles together! [They walked] to preach from one place to another in thousands.<br />

<font color="red">The other day, I was reading about people who are now getting frustrated with Christianity and trying to go to Buddhism or want to go to Islam or anything. They are just the same! There's no difference.<br />
Because what Bible is, or what Christ is, is very different from Christians. What Islam is, is very different from Muslims. That's what all of them admit also. What Buddhism is, is very different from the Buddhist. So what they preach, what they talk about.<br />
The other day, I was reading a book on Islam, I was surprised: is saying the same thing!<br />
Also if you read, say, Buddha, Dhammapad, it says the same thing. Or, these Christian Sciences people, they say the same thing.</font><br />

<b>Quotes</b><br />
<font color="red">The-ee ... great writer who is living now in England, his name is Doctor Mascaró, you might have heard his name, he has written lots of treatises about uh-uh Gītā, and Upaniṣhada[s], also Dhammapad, and also Bible. He is a master. And he is a master of Sanskrit language.<br />
I went to see him, and he gave Me a flower, such a beautiful couplet from Gītā, and he said that, "Mother, give us light. Give them all light so that they can see. Please give them." I said, "I'm doing that!"<br />
I'm doing that, but somehow people do not know what to expect within themselves.</font><br />

<br />
<font color="red">People say that, "In Gītā," I haven't read Gītā, "the one who is born in a particular caste belongs to that caste." I say, "It's not possible."<br />
The author of Gītā, Vedavyās, whose son was he? A fisherwoman's.<br />
The author of Rāmāyaṇa, Vālmīki, who was he? A dacoit who wrote Rāmāyaṇa.<br />
Rāma who ate Śhabarī's berries, Kṛiṣhṇa who had food at Vidura, to understand all these Incarnations we must know that this outward superficiality we have created is all wasteful doings.<br />
We feel secure in all these false ideas we have created, that, 'We belong to a certain sect or religion.' All this is a trick of our intellect, our mental projection, which does not spread around but goes only in one direction and then comes back again.<br />
All such beliefs are of adharma and not of dharma, just not possible. Any person who puts another person down, or says, 'I am placed higher than others,' can't be right, or in dharma.</font><br />

<b>2.23 Quotes</b><br />
<font color="red">The Complete Form of Viṣhṇu came to human beings six thousand year[s] back as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. That is at this chakra known as Viśhuddhi chakra.<br />
Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa is the Complete Form. Where ... why do we say the Complete? Because for Him the whole Play, the whole Līlā, was to be just seen. This whole creation was nothing but just a play created.<br />
He had reached that stage, and He talked of it. He said, "Nainaṃ chindanti śhastrāṇi, nainaṃ dahati pāvakaḥ": "You cannot be killed by any instrument, or by anything."<br />
And He did Saṃhāra. His greatest quality was that He killed many demons on this Earth.<br />
Now those who talk of nonviolence will say, 'How? He was a violent man.' There is a Divine Method which has to be employed to kill those demons. That was needed, and He did kill.</font><br />

<font color="red">And Kṛiṣhṇa had said, "Nainaṃ chindanti śhastrāṇi, nainaṃ dahati pāvakaḥ." This Ātmā and the Vibrations cannot be destroyed. Come what may, this cannot be destroyed.<br />
Just to prove this, the birth of Christ took place.</font><br />

<br />
<font color="red">So-o-o, His purpose was to come on this Earth, on the Āgñyā chakra, as you know that, to open it, and the ... to give a new dimension to our awareness by which we try to understand what Kṛiṣhṇa had said: that, "Nainaṃ chindanti śhastrāṇi, nainaṃ dahati pāvakaḥ." Kṛiṣhṇa had said that, "The Spirit cannot be destroyed, It cannot be killed, It cannot be wiped out, It cannot be blown off." "Na chainaṃ kledayanty āpo, na śhoṣhayati mārutaḥ." "It cannot be sucked in by any air." <br />
And when Kṛiṣhṇa said that, people said, "What sort of a Spirit is that? Where is that Ātmā? What are You talking about? Which One it is?"<br />
So, Christ came on this Earth because He is the essence.<br />
And He showed by His Resurrection that Spirit does not die. And He showed it very clearly what Kṛiṣhṇa had said, because He was, you know, He was Kṛiṣhṇa's Son, and that's how He did it.<br /> 
But before He could deliver the complete thing to human beings they crucified Him. And that is ... mhh ... that is [laughing:] the way they respected Him and that is the way they came to Him.</font><br />

<b>Version 1:</b><br />
<font color="red">And Christ's Mother, Mary, was none other than Rādhā Herself.<br />
Now it is described about Mahāviṣhṇu that Rādhā Herself created Him.<br />
And His father was Kṛiṣhṇa, hence He was named Christ. No one has realized why Christ was called after Kṛiṣhṇa. Because Kṛiṣhṇa was the one to bring in the kṛiṣhi' [plowing], and fruit of that is Christ.<br />
And it has also been described that Kṛiṣhṇa has bestowed upon Christ His sixteenth right. That is, Christ would become the Support of the World and show the people what Kṛiṣhṇa had said, "Nainaṃ chindanti śhastrāṇi, nainaṃ dahati pāvakaḥ, Na chainaṃ kledayanty āpo, na śhoṣhayati mārutaḥ." That this power can never be destroyed and will bring forth the ascent of people. And this has been evidenced in His [Christ's] Resurrection.</font><br />

Now it is described about Mahāviṣhṇu, that Rādhā Herself created Her Son.<br />
And His Father was Viṣhṇu, hence He was named Christ. No one understood why Kṛiṣhṇa was called Christ over there. Kṛiṣhṇa was coined after the word kṛiṣhi. Kṛiṣhṇa practiced farming (kṛiṣhi), and the fruit of that is Christ.<br />
And it has also been described that Kṛiṣhṇa has bestowed upon Christ His sixteenth right. Similarly Christ would become the support of the world and demonstrate people what Kṛiṣhṇa had said: "Nainaṃ chindanti śhastrāṇi, nainaṃ dahati pāvakaḥ." This He will show. That this power can never be destroyed and will bring forth the upliftment of people. And this has been evidenced in His Resurrection.</font><br />

<font color="red">Then we come to Āgñyā chakra, which is the Light Itself. That is the one that enlightens your attention, Āgñyā chakra. That is the Light by which you see everything, after Realization. And when you know you are the Light, and when you know that you are the Eternal Light, that nothing can kill you: "Nainaṃ chindanti śhastrāṇi, nainaṃ dahati pāvakaḥ."<br /> 
Once you know that in your Āgñyā, then all the fears and domination disappear [snapping Her fingers:] just like that. Because it is the Light of Love that does not dominate nor is afraid because it knows it is eternal, it is not afraid of death or of crucifixion or of anything.</font><br />

<font color="red">He had to die to show that the body though [it] dies, can be saved. That's why He had to be crucified. Otherwise He could not have shown you.<br />
But it's actually it was experimented in the Vaikuṇṭha, as you call it, that He died and then resurrected to show that this does not die.<br />
Kṛiṣhṇa has said, "Nainaṃ chindanti śhastrāṇi, nainaṃ dahati pāvakaḥ." "It is not killed by any weapon, neither it is burned by any fires, nor it is blown by any wind." "Na chainaṃ kledayanty āpo, na śhoṣhayati mārutaḥ." "Neither, nothing can suck in." That Spirit is He.</font><br />

<br />
<font color="red">Moses and other people like Him, the Primordial Masters all over the world incarnated in this area and established your sustainance [sustenance]. This was to prepare you for your ascent.<br />
Then came Kṛiṣhṇa, who said that, "It's a Spirit, cannot be destroyed." I'll say it in Sanskrit because it's a mantra. "Nainaṃ chindanti śhastrāṇi, nainaṃ dahati pāvakaḥ. Na chainaṃ kledayanty āpo, na śhoṣhayati mārutaḥ." It cannot be destroyed by anything. True. So the prove He's saying Christ was to be resurrected.</font><br />

<br />
<font color="red">Uh [laughing:] only trouble with Sahaja Yogis is that they take things [a] little lightly. Of course, that is their character. But not Sahaja Yoga. Other things you can take lightly: if somebody shouts at you, somebody gets angry with you, somebody even slaps you, take it lightly. Doesn't matter. Makes no difference to you. Because you are the Spirit: nothing can destroy the Spirit. "Nainaṃ chindanti śhastrāṇi" ["Weapons do not cut It": first part of the first verse of Bhagavad Gītā 2.23].<br />
But when it comes to Sahaja Yoga, your attitude should be different. If you are relaxing on one side, another side you have to be dynamic. And that side is: where you have to put forward the theories of Sahaja Yoga, and you have to talk to people, you have to organize a press conference, or whatever sort of things you want to do.</font><br />

<b>2.47 Quotes</b><br />
<font color="red">So many people I have met who tell Me that, "Mātājī, I only perform my karmas and the fruit I leave at the Lotus Feet of God." You will find these kind of self-satisfied people a lot.<br />
It is not possible. This is diplomacy.<br />
What is the essence of diplomacy? Let Me tell you the essence of diplomacy which is that, 'Put the absurd condition in front.' A person will fall trap into his own web.<br />
Now, see the play of the words here where He said that, "You do your karma and leave the fruit at the feet of God." It's an impossible situation where this is an absurd condition.<br />
Now human being is trying to do it like stupid. All right, keep on doing. Unless and until you are [<font color="orange">unclear</font> detached/broken], until your karma becomes akarma, until you become empty from within, this can't be achieved because ego and superego are sitting on your head. Whatever you will do it will be either by the force of ego or by superego.<br />
So how can you surrender to God unless you have a connection with God?<br />
He in fact said: "Karmaṇy-evādhikāras te mā phaleṣhu kadāchana." Kṛiṣhṇa said this and that too by putting this absurd condition because it's not easy to get human beings to the right understanding.<br />
I am watching that even after six thousand years the situation is still the same.</font><br />
<b>1978-0131 Public Program (Hindi), Day 2, Void, Heart, Viśhuddhi, Channels, New Delhi, India</b><br />

<font color="red">For karma, He said: that, "Do all the work and put it at the Lotus Feet of God Almighty." 
That's not possible. Many people say: that, "Mother, all my work, I put at the Lotus Feet of God." Even the murders, I think! [Smiles.] It['s] just a mental idea: that, 'I am putting it at the Lotus Feet of God.' You cannot! Because you are not at that state.<br />
But say, a Sahaja Yogi, he will not tell Me, that 'I am raising the Kuṇḍalinī,' he'll say, 'Mother, it doesn't come up. Is not coming, it ...', in the third person he talks. He will say: 'This won't go that side,' in the third person. Because he is no more there.<br />
So, this is what is the karma: automatically is at the Lotus Feet of God Almighty, if He is doing everything! We are just instruments!</font><br />

<font color="red">The second one was the karma, that you do your work. You go on doing your work, with a 'detached mind'. I mean it's not possible, but that's what they say. And we are doing our karmas, good karmas, we do all kinds of good things, go to various places for our cleansing, meet many great people of spirituality, go to all various places, and pray. Visit all auspicious places which are being described, all kinds of rituals, we do for that.<br />
That is the ... Karma Yoga.<br />
And that is what: the Karma Yoga, according to us, is the right side.<br />
Many people, as you know, are right-sided. Right-sided people are the people who are, as you know, full of ego, arrogance, and think no end of themselves. Very difficult to correct them. They also never see anything wrong with them. Whichever way they act, they think, 'Is all right.'<br />
That is the Karma Yoga.<br />
But He has said that: "Whatever karmas you do, whatever its fruits are, that you cannot say." He said it in a very uncertain manner. Because, definitely, if He had said it with certainty, people would never have understood Him. So He said: "It's not possible! That whatever karmas you are doing could be the karmas which will get you the blessings of the Divine." "Karmaṇy-evādhikāras te phaleṣhu mā kadāchana" [mā phaleṣhu" reversed], He has said it.<br />
So then, 'Which karmas we should do? Or should we give up all the karmas? All the action, we should give up?' People were in two minds.<br />
This is the style of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa: is to put people in two minds, so they use their discretion.</font><br />

<b>2.55 Quotes</b><br />
<font color="red">So at this time, what is your first job is to try to be more exposed to Me, so that automatically you'll go into your sattvaguṇa. This is the best!<br />
But if I am not there, and when you are alone, or when you are with other Sahaja Yogis, you must now compete in rising higher and higher: from tamoguṇa to rajoguṇa, and from rajoguṇa to sattvaguṇa.<br />
But, actually, by Realization you have gone beyond these three guṇas. You have gone beyond it. Actually that is what has happened to you.<br />
But, like clouds, they cover you again and again.<br />
And when the sky is covered with those clouds, you cannot see the sun, you cannot see the moon, you cannot see the stars.<br />
So we have to know how these clouds are coming into us. And that's how we go into our complete analysis: 'How these clouds are coming to us?'<br />
You find out about our different chakras: 'What are the chakras we are catching?' Here comes the another constant attention towards our chakras. 'Are our vibrations all right or not? Are we getting our vibrations? If not, what chakra am I catching? What must be the catch? I must raise my Kuṇḍalinī, see for myself, where is the catch. Do I do my meditation or not? If I do it, am I doing it just dozingly or am I ... am I really in it? Am I really feeling it or not? Am I alert or not?'<br />
All this is to be assiduously, sincerely, absolutely, truthfully should be worked out. Because it is a process between your Self: "Ātmane evātmanā tuṣhṭaḥ." You see, it's so very funny, it is so funny relationship: that it is the Ātmā is satisfied with Ātmā! You have to be satisfied with your Self.<br />
There's nobody, Mātājī is not concerned, nobody is concerned. It is you [that] are concerned with your Self. </font><br />

There is only one reason which I have told you before and I am telling you again, that there are no complete Saints or Sādhus in this world. In each Sādhu they have sent one, one rākṣhasa. They must [have] gone into your attention. Have you understood?<br />
If it is some Sādhu then it's all right. "Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṃ vināśhāya cha duṣhkṛutām."<br /> 
But if with the Sādhu there is the devil sitting inside then he will have to be removed with a lot of love, isn't it? What a difficult work this is. You are standing in the saintly position and there is also the devil within. But if you are standing as a Saint and there is a devil within, you can remove it.</font><br />

<font color="red">So, Arjuna said, "What about dharma? What about devotion to God? These are our organized religions, churches, and our temples and all, what about that?"<br />
He says that also, He was very clever. He says in Sanskrit, "Puṣhpaṃ, phalaṃ, toyaṃ." "Whatever is the fruit, whatever is the flower, or whatever is the water you give Me, I'll take it. I'll take all that. If you give me a flower, I'll take it." "But by giving" -- He is very clever, which I don't know if people have seen the point or not -- He says, "By giving," He says, "by that you do Ananya Bhakti,"  devotion that is ananya. Now the word ananya is the word, which is the real feel of God. A-nanya, it means: when you are not the other, when you are realized. You can only do bhakti when you are realized, ananya. The person who's ananya, means the one who is not the other, you become one with God, then you do the bhakti. Very clearly He says: that, "You do Ananya Bhakti." Ananya Devotion: means, devotion when you are not the other, when you are realized. Before that what's the devotion? Very cleverly He said, but nobody sees the point.</font><br />

<font color="red">Looking at his country, of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, when we torture women in the name of religion are we capable of us being Indians? We go on trumpeting about Indian culture. But are we capable of calling ourselves where we go out [abroad] and project ourselves about burning and killing our daughters-in-law? And so the outsiders say that, 'Your country is such spiritual place, so much knowledge is there, people talk about righteousness and lecture about it, then how is it so that such horrible events happen?' What answer do we have on this?<br />
Only one answer is there, that Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa has said, "Yogakṣhemaṁ vahāmyaham."<br />
There is a catch in this. 'First there should be Yoga, and then I will look after their benevolence.' Why Did He not say, 'Kṣhema-yoga'?<br />
First there will be Yoga, and then benevolence. This is the depiction of dharma. So first you achieve your Yoga.<br />
So if you glorify the Indian culture, then the most essential and important essence of this culture is that you achieve your Self-realization.</font><br />

<font color="red">But the second thing He said, that, you should do [laughing:] bhakti: "Whatever fruit or flower or water you give Me, I'll take it. But you must do bhakti which is ananya."<br />
Now if you know Sanskrit, ananya: when you are not the other. When you are a realized Soul!<br />
If you are not connected, what is the bhakti on you? Many people complain: "Mother, I have been fasting, I have been doing this, I did this, and see my condition. I've become a nervous wreck." Is not the mistake of God: you are not yet connected.<br />
Is-s, simple thing like a telephone: is [if] the telephone is not connected, wha[t']s the use of telephoning? You spoil the telephone.<br />
So, bhakti without the connection is wrong. That's why Kṛiṣhṇa has said it: "Yogakṣhemaṁ vahāmyaham": "First Yog, then kṣhema." First you must achieve your Yoga, and then your benevolence will come. Otherwise, it won't work out.<br />
Very subtly He has put Yoga first. Why didn't He say, 'Kṣhema-yoga'?<br />
So, for bhakti He said like this.</font><br />

<font color="red">Kṛiṣhṇa has said in His Gītā, kī [that], "Sarva-dharmān parityajya Mām ekaṃ śharaṇaṃ vraja." "Forget about all your dharmas." Dharma means in His meaning that we have a dharma of a wife, of a husband, of a uh-uh-uh-uh member of the society, all of them have their own dharma. But He says, "Leave them! And leave it them to Me, and I'll manage."<br />
This is it, we have to learn: is to say that, 'Is this Divine Power which will solve our problems.'<br />
As human beings, it's a very difficult state.<br />
And this state only can be achieved through meditation. But I am say... not saying that you go on meditating for hours altogether: not necessary.

<b>Quotes</b><br />
<font color="red">In all the above verses, Prophet Muhammad has talked about Rebirth [True Baptism], the Day of Resurrection and has also said that hatred and enmity in the name of religion will last till the Day of Resurrection. True Baptism is only after the Kuṇḍalinī awakening, which is happening now. The Muslim way of offering prayers, Namāz as taught by the Prophet, was in fact a way of Kuṇḍalinī awakening.</font><br />
<b>1900-0000 Two Quotes from the book Divine Knowledge through Vibrations (1992) by P.T. Rajasekharan and R. Venkatesan, Page 73</b><br />
<br />
<font color="red">According to me, Hazrate [Hazarat] Muhammad was one of the greatest incarnations because he was even greater than a Prophet. He announced some prophecies which none of the incarnations, such as Jesus, had described. The first thing he said was that we must have Meerraj [Mirāj], meaning the ascent through different levels. And at the third level he described how he met with all the previous Prophets such as Ibrahim, and he described the ascent on the white horse which is actually the power of Kundalini [Kuṇḍalinī]. Secondly, he said that when you receive your realization you have to fully surrender, meaning "Islam", and then your hands will speak. He did not condemn any previous religion or incarnation. For example, the Kabe Makeshwara [Kaaba Makkeśhwara] is also described in the Indian Koran [Qur'ān]. And thirdly, he described the next advent that is going to come. He never said that he was the last one. What shows that he never said he was the last is that he said that I am the seal, meaning that he was the stamp of the Prophets. He described the work of the advent of Mandi [Mahdī]. The word of Mandi [Mahdī] actually means the incarnation of the great primordial Mother -- Ma + Adi [Ādi]. No one has prophesised [prophesized] so clearly about Sahaja Yoga except for Hazrate [Hazarat] Muhammad who has described Sahaja Yoga in his great book of Koran [Qur'ān].</font><br />
<b>1901-0000 Letter Published in the Turkish Newspaper Bursa</b><br />
<br />
<font color="red">So much has been said in the Qur'ān. My father who translated the Qur'ān has mentioned it, which I have read.<br />
The whole of Namāz depicts the awakening of Kuṇḍalinī.<br />
And in it, He mentioned Allah hu Akbar, that Akbar is Himself Śhrī Virāṭa.<br />
If I say this to the Muslims will come after Me. Even the Hindus will come after Me.</font><br />

<br />
<font color="red">So, it is all described iking uh-uhb uh Qur'ān. There's a complete Sūrah describing about the Sent One, means the Avatāra, means the Incarnation. And also said that, "You won't believe," "You won't accept," and all those things.  </font><br />

<br />
<font color="red">Even in the Islam they showed Me a complete Sūrah written about Me, that the Sent One, they call Me a Sent One, and, 'That person will give you Realization, that would make you Pīrs, that will give you Collective Consciousness,' everything written in that, so beautiful, you won't believe it. "But you will not believe, you will be non-believers." Like that it is written in that.</font><br />

<br />
<font color="red">In any book whatsoever, take it Bible, or go to Qur'ān, or go to any book, Zen, go to Buddhist, uh-uh-uh books of a Dhammapad, or you go to any other Śhāstras, like Vedas, they have talked of Kuṇḍalinī all right.</font><br />
<b>1985-0603 Public Program, Day 1, The Bayard Rustin High School for the Humanities, 351 W 18th Street, New York City, NY, U.S.A.</b><br />
<br />
<font color="red">The other day, I was reading about people who are now getting frustrated with Christianity and trying to go to Buddhism or want to go to Islam or anything. They are just the same! There's no difference.<br />
Because what Bible is, or what Christ is, is very different from Christians. What Islam is, is very different from Muslims. That's what all of them admit also. What Buddhism is, is very different from the Buddhist. So what they preach, what they talk about.<br />
The other day, I was reading a book on Islam, I was surprised: is saying the same thing!<br />
Also if you read, say, Buddha, Dhammapad, it says the same thing. Or, these Christian Sciences people, they say the same thing.</font><br />

<font color="red">Like there's one boy who has fished out lots of things from Qur'ān, [he] is German, from Qur'ān, what it has to say for Sahaj.<br />
And they said, "Thes ... there is a Sūrah called Saishta [Śhāsti] Yoga, Saishta [Śhāsti] Yoga" [Sūrah 36: Yāʾ-Sīn], and that Sūrah is dealing with Me. Because eve... will be ... it is said that: "We are going to send, and the Sent, the One who is sent, will not be acceptable to you. You will deny, you will defy." Everything is described. Even, that's, "Your hands will speak," at the Time  of your Resurrection, all that in that Sūrah is given. It's very interesting, that Sūrah is.</font><br />

<font color="red">Whatever is said about the Last Judgment, this is the time for that Last Judgment.<br />
Also in Qur'ān it is said: that, "At the Time of your Resurrection, your hands will speak, and they will give witness against you." Exactly this happens in Sahaja Yoga. The Sūrah that is in Qur'ān called as Sashtī [Śhāsti] Yoga [Sūrah 36: Yāʾ-Sīn], is surprising how Muhammad Sāhab clearly said about it.</font><br />

<font color="red">In the Qur'ān there is one beautiful Sūrah called Saishta [Śhāsti] Yoga [Sūrah 36: Yāʾ-Sīn]. In that they have described all about it, that, "Your hands will speak, at the Time of your Resurrection. And they will give witness against you."</font><br />

<br />
<font color="red">In Qur'ān, there's a Sūrah [36] called Ee uh-uh-uh ... Yāʾsīn, meaning ... they say that Yoga Sajadā [Prayer] is the name of that one, in which Muhammad Sāhab has clearly described: "At the Time of Resurrection, your hands will speak."<br />
Now, if Muhammad Sāhab was the last Man [see 33:40], why did He talk of Resurrection? Why did He talk of the future? Why did He say, "Your hands will speak"?</font><br />
