<p>
Dear Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginīs,<br>
<br>
Jay Śhrī Mātājī!<br>
<br>
We are pleased to mention that Step 6, Divine Events, has been started with the very first 547 events from the period 1997 to 2011. Step 6 of the database aims to facilitate the search of all events. It comes with multiple key features, including:<br>
<br>
1. Structured in just 3 simple layers: titles, key quotes and comments.<br>
2. Streamlined categories and subcategories.<br>
3. The color tags groups the categories into subcategories.<br>
4. As we are looking at a number of events between 16,000 and 1,000,000, the monthly category is a vital component.<br>
5. Everything on one page <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/tag-events/"><font color="pink">Tags of the Divine Events</font></a>.<br>
6. The new events added can be easily traced at the link <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/tag-events/"><font color="pink">Divine Events Posts</font></a>.<br>
7. A system of dates that allows 00, 0000, x, y, and z in the dates.</font></a>.<br>

Please kindly share the news with all our brothers and sisters.<br>
