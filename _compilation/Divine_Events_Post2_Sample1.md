Dear Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginīs,<br>
<br>
Happy New Year<br>
<br>
We would like to get feedback on 10 to 16 samples of the Divine Events: on colors, on spacing, on the number of images (please keep in mind that the strict unwritten rules do not allow more than 4 images per Divine Event), etc.
Link to the first sample: <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/events/1973-1231"> 1973-1231 Departure with Official Farewell of Sir C.P., Airport, Mumbai, India</a>.</font><br>
We thank you in advance for any possible feedback.<br>
