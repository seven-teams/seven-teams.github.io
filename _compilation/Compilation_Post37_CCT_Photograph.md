<font color="DarkRed">"This Photo was taken after I opened the Collective Sahasrāra Chakra. I even look a bit sad.<br>
I look very serious in this Photo. At that time I even stopped eating and became a little thin.<br>
From birth I knew I was the Goddess, and My job was to save and raise up this doomed humanity."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Do you differentiate Me, the physical Form and My Photograph in My nirākār Form? At times I Myself wonder how it works out, but it works out even at times better that My own physical presence before You.<br>
May be you need to stabilize your wandering thoughts and seek Mother in your heart, you really do not need to come near Me to meet Me to get your all problems solved. My Photograph ......"</font><br>

[In early eighties Śhrī Mātājī discovers that catches from removed ex-leaders have passed on to new Sahaja Yogis who have received Realization from them.]<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> [Asking these new Sahaja Yogis:] <font color="DarkRed">Did he [removed ex-leader] give you Realization before My Photograph or without it?</font><br>
<b>New Sahaja Yogis:</b> Before Your Photograph.<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> <font color="DarkRed">Then it is I who gave you Realization, so there is no reason to feel indebted to him. Forget him.</font> [With that, catches fled.]<br>
[Śhrī Mātājī instructs that Realization should be given before Her Photo, then the catches do not transfer from one to another. Moreover, one does not absorb the catches of the seekers.]<br>

[Arriving in a city for a Public Program, Śhrī Mātājī observes there are no posters anywhere.]
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> <font color="DarkRed">Why there are no posters?</font><br>
<b>Sahaja Yogis:</b> Śhrī Mātājī, we were worried about the protocol of Your Photograph. People might tear or trample on them.<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> <font color="DarkRed"> The city gets vibrated with My Photograph, and that is how the Paramachaitanya informs the seekers through their unconsciousness. When I went to Russia, the Russian seekers had never known about Me but the Unconscious informed them and they came in thousands. When I asked them, "How did you recognize Me?" They answered, "From your Photograph of course Mother." I have given permission for putting My Photograph on posters, you don't have to worry about the protocol.</font><br>

"In meditation try to stop your thoughts. <font color="DarkRed">Watch My Photograph with open eyes and see that you stop your thoughts.</font> You should stop your thoughts, then you go into meditation. The simple thing to stop your thoughts is the Lord's Prayer, because that's the Āgñyā state. So in the morning you remember Lord's Prayer or Gaṇeśha's mantra. It's just the same. Or you even say 'I forgive'. So you can start with Gaṇeśha's mantra, say Lord's Prayer and then say ]I forgive'. It works out."<br>

"So, there is another question which was asked - of course, they ... they thought it was very wise, and I think it is a great help - that, "When we put hands to You, we burn. But when Your disciples put hands to us, they burn. Now, who is the positive, who is the negative?" It's a complicated question.<br>
So, for that, we have to use a person who is lunatic: absolute accepted lunatic or psychologically affected person. <font color="DarkRed">Ask that person to put the hands to Me or to My Photograph, and raise the Kuṇḍalinī, he'll start shaking too much.</font> Now, you ask a realized person to put his hand and go into meditation, while a person who is suffering from negativity will start shaking and burning.<br>
The one who is a certified person and a negative personality, the one who suffers from inferiority complexes and the fear and all these symptoms of negativity, should be used as a measuring rod.<br>
One gentleman wanted to take full advantage of My raising things. <font color="DarkRed">He took My Photograph and put it and all that thing.</font> And he also said he was My disciple, [laughing:] very openly. Of course, I accepted that, "You be my Guru. You can give me something sensible." And then I got something also, [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] he said, "You must tell people that, 'I am your guru.' " I said, "All this thing if you want I will tell them. But I don't think you have done anything unique." But even now he is been too much. He is telling people that he's doing My work."<br>

"Whosoever will come in front of you should dissolve in your love. And if he does not dissolve, then he will run away. A day will come and that day you will not need this protection.<br>
You people have found many ways of protection. These people can tell you about some of the ways if you want. You can ask them. <font color="DarkRed">Like taking vibrations on the Photo.</font> Taking out [vibrations] with feet or taking out with water. How to put your own bandhan, etc. Taking different names, etc. There are many types. If you want to know about them then you can talk to these people, then these people can tell you all this.<br>
......<br>
You have to do no business whatsoever.<br>
You have not to collect money in any way. For nothing at all.<br>
One person said to Me that he will sell My Photos and then that money he will give to the Āśhram. I said, "Which Āśhram? What money? Who said so? Why do you listen to others?" "<br>
