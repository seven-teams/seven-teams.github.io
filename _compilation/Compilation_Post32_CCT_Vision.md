<font color="DarkRed">"This is the era of Enlightenment. One can see and feel the bubbling of new idioms in our creative world of art, music and all that is beautiful and joy-giving. Integration is the key note of this new regeneration of universal tones. These tones are ripples of the harmonic, dynamic undercurrent music of the Universal Divine Love.<br>
<font color="DarkRed">Is there a possibility of this love expressed in the unity of human beings with God Almighty giving a new vision to the apparent diversities?</font><br>
Is it possible that this unique happening is accessible to many, that they may see their own creative world revolving in the great universe of All-pervading Power?<br>
My only answer is, 'Yes.'<br>
My only question is, 'Why not?' "</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"The music, and the art, the creativity, is all within us. We all have the ability within us, but we need to establish the technique. With poetry, drawing or music, we must have the technique or we cannot express it properly. The creativity is there, but it cannot be expressed properly without the knowledge of the technique. <font color="DarkRed">It is such a great gift to be able to paint or sculpt and create works of art that please the Spirit and bring joy to all who see them; to be able to express the joy of life and the vision of our ascent through poetry.</font> Such gifts we have been given. Let us use them to their fullest potential. Like our bodies, as temples for the Spirit, are looked after and decorated with beautiful things, our lives are enriched by the beauty of the arts and music. If we have the ability and the knowledge within us, then let's learn how to share it with the world. If the words are there but we cannot speak and share them, what is the point of it? We can learn how to express and share these gifts we have been given."</font><br>

"No one has experienced something like this before. And nowhere in the world has this experiment been successful anywhere before this because I too have come on this Earth many times before. I have thought of doing this many times before and this is the first time in this lifetime that this work has been successful.<br>
That is why whatever unfinished that is left you have to complete it. You have not come to belittle or pull down anyone. Whatever incompleteness has been left, you have to complete it. <font color="DarkRed">Just think that you are new persons in this modern world with an expanded vision, and you have to guide the whole world.</font><br>
......<br>
<font color="DarkRed">In everything, in your behavior, your talk, the way you talk, in your touch, your laughter, and your tears. In everything there should be such a vision of your heart. It is massive. This massiveness should show from within you. There should be a Vision of the Skies within you. The Purity of Water should reflect from within you. The Brilliance of the Sun should show from your face, the Coolness of the Moon should flow from within you. Flowing everywhere, you should be like the Wind.</font>"<br>

"Peace and thoughtless awareness will be established in you: you are in antar maun [inner silence] but aware of all outside things. <font color="DarkRed">Your vision will have a State of Witness.</font> Your intelligence will become dynamic, it becomes unique.

"One should remain in Thoughtlessness. This is your place, your wealth, your strength (śhakti). This is your form. This is your beauty. This is your life. Thoughtless! As soon as you are thoughtless the outside methods, the whole of it starts moving in your hands. Live in thoughtlessness. Over there, there is no Time, no Direction, nor can anyone touch it. <font color="DarkRed">There is only a vision of the Living. There is only a vision of Life and how it blooms. There is vision of its Beauty, its Capability, its Prosperity and its Truth. Watch it from where the stream of life is flowing.</font>"<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"That's One who knows as Kṣhetragñya: is the One who knows the field, field, the Knower of the field. Actually it is the Self Itself.<br>
But His vision in us, the vision of that -- you can call, that's what I call is the shadow -- the vision of that Self, we are all the time conscious of it. It is watching us even when they are ... we are alone, when we are in company and everywhere. It is watching us. This One in the [Bhagavad] Gītā is called as Kṣhetragñya: kṣhetra is the field, and the One it's a Knower of it.<br>
Actually the Knower is the Self. But through Its vision, through Its power of knowledge It is knowing everything and we know that It is there. ``We," that means the ego part. The ego knows that pondery [somebody] is watching it.<br>
With Sahaja Yoga, everything, what happens: that that vision that you have throughout, becomes the vibrations, becomes energetic, in the sense that you can have a rapport with that point from where it has manifested."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"And that's how, when you start respecting yourself, respecting your thoughts, respecting your inspirations, your dreams, your aspirations, your visions, write them down. Whatever thought you get, write it down. Whatever inspiration you get, write it down. Whatever visions you think you should have for yourself, write it down. All that you think that should be the future, write it down, and pray for it.<br>
The greatest quality on this one is when you respect yourself. "</font><br>

Since people's vision is upright down, so we have to enlighten them and this is such a time.<br>
......<br>
Because I have Absolute Knowledge that you don't see, that Śhrī Nāṇak explained as Alakh. I see with that vision."<br>

<b>Version 2<b>
"But the undercurrents beneath this or what is understood due to intuition or what is subtly understood, that which you cannot see, for which you still do not have vision, for which you do not have sensation or have not reached a state of complete fulfillment to experience this, then how will you understand that this problem is due to the Gaṇeśh Tattwa having gone bad and that Śhrī Gaṇeśh is upset with us? That is why we cannot achieve Sahaja Yoga without pleasing that Deity."</font><br>
