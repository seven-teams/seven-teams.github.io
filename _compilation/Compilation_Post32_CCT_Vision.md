<font color="DarkRed">"This is the era of Enlightenment. One can see and feel the bubbling of new idioms in our creative world of art, music and all that is beautiful and joy-giving. Integration is the key note of this new regeneration of universal tones. These tones are ripples of the harmonic, dynamic undercurrent music of the Universal Divine Love.<br>
<font color="DarkRed">Is there a possibility of this love expressed in the unity of human beings with God Almighty giving a new vision to the apparent diversities?</font><br>
Is it possible that this unique happening is accessible to many, that they may see their own creative world revolving in the great universe of All-pervading Power?<br>
My only answer is, `Yes.'<br>
My only question is, `Why not?'"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"The music, and the art, the creativity, is all within us. We all have the ability within us, but we need to establish the technique. With poetry, drawing or music, we must have the technique or we cannot express it properly. The creativity is there, but it cannot be expressed properly without the knowledge of the technique. <font color="DarkRed">It is such a great gift to be able to paint or sculpt and create works of art that please the Spirit and bring joy to all who see them; to be able to express the joy of life and the vision of our ascent through poetry.</font> Such gifts we have been given. Let us use them to their fullest potential. Like our bodies, as temples for the Spirit, are looked after and decorated with beautiful things, our lives are enriched by the beauty of the arts and music. If we have the ability and the knowledge within us, then let's learn how to share it with the world. If the words are there but we cannot speak and share them, what is the point of it? We can learn how to express and share these gifts we have been given."</font><br>

"No one has experienced something like this before. And nowhere in the world has this experiment been successful anywhere before this because I too have come on this Earth many times before. I have thought of doing this many times before and this is the first time in this lifetime that this work has been successful.<br>
That is why whatever unfinished that is left you have to complete it. You have not come to belittle or pull down anyone. Whatever incompleteness has been left, you have to complete it. <font color="DarkRed">Just think that you are new persons in this modern world with an expanded vision, and you have to guide the whole world.</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">In everything, in your behavior, your talk, the way you talk, in your touch, your laughter, and your tears. In everything there should be such a vision of your heart. It is massive. This massiveness should show from within you. There should be a Vision of the Skies within you. The Purity of Water should reflect from within you. The Brilliance of the Sun should show from your face, the Coolness of the Moon should flow from within you. Flowing everywhere, you should be like the Wind.</font>"<br>

"One should remain in Thoughtlessness. This is your place, your wealth, your strength (śhakti). This is your form. This is your beauty. This is your life. Thoughtless! As soon as you are thoughtless the outside methods, the whole of it starts moving in your hands. Live in thoughtlessness. Over there, there is no Time, no Direction, nor can anyone touch it. <font color="DarkRed">There is only a vision of the Living. There is only a vision of Life and how it blooms. There is vision of its Beauty, its Capability, its Prosperity and its Truth. Watch it from where the stream of life is flowing.</font>"<br>
