Dear Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginīs,<br>
<br>
Happy New Year<br>
<br>
We would like to get feedback on 16 samples of the Divine Events: on colors, on spacing, on the number of images (please keep in mind that the strict unwritten rules do not allow more than 4 images per Divine Event), etc.
Samples:<br>
<b>1.</b> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/events/1973-1231"> <font color="DeepPink">1973-1231 Departure with Official Farewell of Sir C.P., Airport, Mumbai, India</font></a> started on 2023-1231.<br>
<b>2.</b> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/events/1974-0101"> <font color="DeepPink">1974-0101 Arrival, Airport, London, UK</font></a> started on 2024-0101.<br><br>
<b>3.</b><br>

We thank you in advance for any possible feedback at any time.<br>
