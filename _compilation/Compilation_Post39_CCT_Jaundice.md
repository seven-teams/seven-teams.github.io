<font color="red">"Treatment for jaundice is as follows. Boil young radish leaves in water, add rock candy to that water and drink it continuously. Do not drink any other water. Vibrate the water before drinking.<br>
Second treatment is to put some mustard oil in a brass or a bronze bowl and rotate it (oil) in a clockwise direction with either nābhī [finger] or all the fingers. One of the hands -- left or right -- should be towards the photo. Watch both hands, and whichever hand feels lighter should be kept towards the photo. The oil will slowly become thick and yellow. Do not throw this oil in water but take it far away and burn it. You will feel better if you do this two-three times. Do not eat any oil or ghee at all. Give vibration[s] to Nābhī and liver while keeping the other hand towards the photo."</font><br>

"Now, this Swādhiṣhṭhāna chakra is to be looked after.<br>
In Delhi, Swādhiṣhṭhāna chakra is the first problem. Firstly, because you think too much. Secondly, you think you are running the show. Thirdly, the water of Delhi is not good.<br>
I've requested all the people, all the Sahaja Yogis to boil their foo... water and drink it. And never wat... drink water outside. At the most if you have to drink then you can drink something bottled. But try to boil the water all the time to keep your Swādhiṣhṭhāna chakra all right.<br>
<font color="red">It [unboiled water] causes jaundice and all kinds of problems, because water is the basis of Swādhiṣhṭhāna chakra.</font><br>
So if you try to spoil the Nābhī, by ... Nābhī is the basis, and N... if Nābhī gets spoiled, then Swādhiṣhṭhāna also gets spoiled. Because from Nābhī the Swādhiṣhṭhāna chakra has arisen.<br>
Moreover, one has to know how to give balance to oneself, ah-ah ... when the Swādhiṣhṭhāna is out."<br>

<font color="red"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> <font color="red">Now, this kind of a hand, if you see, yellowish color, all right, ...</font>
<b>Dr. Warren Reeves:</b> It's liver!
<font color="red"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> <font color="red">... itself, it means liver. This is a liver patient: definitely a liver patient, this one.<br>
Now, for such a hand, what should you do: is to take uh-uh-uh the water that I've given you, and boil it with radish leaves. And take radish leaves and sugar with it. That water you have to take for some time.<br>
Specially when you have this flood water. After that you should be careful, because people can get jaundice.</font><br>
You see, this flood is not such a disaster: the aftereffects of floods are.<br> 
This water is not good, you should not take any other water but spring water. Spring water you should drink. <font color="red">And, as far as possible, be careful about jaundice.</font><br>
<font color="red">If jaundice sets in, the only solution is that you should take radish leaves, eat lot of radish, and boil it in that water that I give you, today, and put some sugar in it, and just take that water, nothing else.</font><br>
Because that's one thing one has to be careful: when such a flood comes in, the aftereffects of the floods can be felt. All right?<br>

<b>Dr. Warren Reeves:</b> Very much.<br>
<font color="red"><b>Śhrī Mātājī</b></font> <font color="red">So one should know how to treat jaundice and look after yourself.<br>
Jaundice is really, could be fatal and is very dangerous because it spoils your uh liver very badly.<br>
So, to be on safe side, eat lot of radish, and the uh also take that water as I told you, for your jaundice.</font><br>

"Now, all other such diseases, specially the worst of all, that is the result. Of course, liver is horrifyingly bad.<br>
And liver can be cured through Sahaj Yog only. It cannot be cured up.<br>
Actually I have seen that people develop cirrhosis of liver or cancer of liver, only then we realize that the fellow has a liver trouble.<br>
<font color="red">But liver starts at a very early age in ... specially in the Western countries. Because the mothers are always thinking, the fathers are always planning, the poor child is born with jaundice, is born with jaundice.<br>
And jaundice is so easily curable. But so many people die of this little thing called jaundice, children specially.</font>"<br>

"Children need sugar so give it. But not in such a form that it sticks to teeth but which goes in the stomach.<br>
Secondly, in summers a fruit named kokum is found in Maharashtra. Soak it overnight, and boil it next day, add some sugar and give it to the child during day.<br>
<font color="red">If one suffers from jaundice, then boil radish leaves, mix vibrated sugar and give to the child. Child can be cured of jaundice in one day.</font><br>
In summers give juice of radish. Give radish to children, it is good for them.<br>
We give lot of fried this to children, it should not be done."<br>

"So I concluded that a drunkard's child is born with a damaged liver. <font color="red">So, you have given your child a damaged liver from the beginning, and as soon as a child is born, he will get jaundice.</font> If the father's or mother's liver is damaged, then the child also is born with a damaged liver."<br>

"Then I have also seen that a some children have very uh uh thin body, very low weight, some children have. So you must immediately find out if the child has got liver.<br>
<font color="red">Could be the child could have got this liver in the hospital. Because they are born realized children, and in the hospital when the child is born there might be hepatitis going on or something, children will catch this, and they get jaundice and things.<br>
Now for all these children there's a very good medicine is: to boil the radish leaves, put some uh-uh-uah candy sugar in it, and give that as a medicine and don't give water, to little babies, up to a point, you see, say about uh, say about when they are about six months or so. In the water you can give that radish leaves. Is ... uhv ... even earlier you can do it. You warm it up [a] little bit and give it. You can mix it up with candy sugar. The taste may not be so good, but it's the medicine for the children, for small children.<br>
Because if you do not give them proper liver in childhood, basically they'll always have this trouble later.</font>"<br>
