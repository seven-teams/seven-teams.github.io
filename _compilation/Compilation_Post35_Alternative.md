<b>Version 1:</b><br>
"You must say the mantras during Pūjā, but with complete śhraddhā. <font color="DarkRed">There is no alternative to śhraddhā.</font> When your śhraddhā is exquisite [profound], then only you should sit for a Pūjā. That way the Pūjā is done by heart. That time waves after waves of joy start flowing because when Ātmā Tattwa is the focal point there can not be any thoughts. The way people fill wine in a glass, same is with you performing Pūjā, your śhraddhā is the wine and the glass is nothing but the recitation of mantras and sādhana. While drinking this wine you are completely engrossed, with no thoughts, and you swim in this joy. How to express that joy in thoughts [words]? The wine which is inside the stomach, who is going to pour it back into a glass? And that too in an inferior glass made of thoughts. Joy after drinking this wine is eternal. It is your wealth. Many Pūjās like this have happened in front of Me and every time a big wave comes and takes you to a new shore. Those experiences from different shores become your own. They give grandness to your personality and open new doors of joy.<br>
It is best to do a Pūjā in the heart. If you can look at the Photo and then bring it into your heart, or after a Pūjā if you can bring that scene into your heart, then the joy of that moment can become permanent and will last for a long time. Read this letter to all Sahaja Yogis and send them copies of this letter."<br>
<br>
<b>Version 2:</b><br>
"You should say the Mantras in Pūjā but with great faith (śhraddhā). <font color="DarkRed">There is no alternative to śhraddhā.</font> You should perform the Pūjā when śhraddhā grows deep, so that heart itself gets all Pūjā performed. At that time waves of bliss start flowing because it is the Spirit that is saying, how can any thought come at that time? People pour their wine in the glass. Your Pūjā is like that. In that, wine is your faith and the glass is the recitation of Mantras and the worshiping. When you are drinking that wine forgetting everything, how can a thought come! Then only bathing in the Ocean of Bliss! How can that joy be expressed in thoughts? Who will pour that wine, back in the glass, which is to be drunk and that too in the inferior glass of thoughts? However, the joy that you get after drinking the wine is eternal and ever-present. It becomes your asset. Many such Pūjās have been performed in My presence. Every time a big wave comes and take you to a new land. Experiences of many such lands become your own. They give vastness to personality and open new gates of joy.<br>
Best is worshiping in the heart. If, the Photo by looking at it, can be placed in heart or, after the Pūjā, its view goes to heart, then the joy which you get only at that time, can become everlasting and ever-present. Show this letter, to all Sahaja Yogis and send its copies."<br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> So-o, to become closer to God, you have to be closer to God. That's as simple as that.<br>
I mean somebody would say: 'How do I know that I know that ... what ... how to drive a car?' When you know. 'How do I know I [laughing:] can drive a bike?' Say, for example somebody says, 'How can I use a bike?' I mean when you are that you are that! I mean is there any other way out? 'How will I say I've got eyes?' When you can see! Finished! I mean it's so simple as that.<br>
So, how can you say you are nearer to God? You yourself will know you are nearer to God. Because the joy of being that tells you.<br>
You need not be close to Me, you need not be touching My Feet, you could be anywhere in the forest, you could be very close to Me, and those who thing [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] they are close to Me because they can make a little face and, you know, behave in a very artificial way or some dramatic styles, you see, they are very far away.<br>

"Like Blake has said, that, "Men of God will become Prophets, and the ... these Prophets will have powers to make others Prophets."<br>
He said it so clearly for you English people, but I don't think you people like Him very much. [Laughing:] Because ... because the way peo... few people I have seen, who really appreciate Blake. And some of them have said that, "He is mad!" Naturally, among all the mad people, a sane person may look mad also. But He is the one who has so clearly said.<br>
And in this country, this great man should be born, and should talk about Jerusalem, is remarkable!<br>
Because you cannot think, in England, where people just believe in dominating other countries and using the ... their power to dominate others, you could get Jerusalem established!<br>
But what He said was of these days, when those false ideas have dropped off, when people do not think of domination, they do not think of materialism, they are fed up with all these things, and they are seeking today.<br> 
And who are these seekers? These seekers are the men of God.<br>
So, recognize yourself. First of all, you must recognize your Self before recognizing anybody else, that you are seekers and that you are men of God.<br>

It's, I ... I sometimes feel you are just fighting your shadows! This is the, you have created shadows, and the shadows are fighting. And just to make the shadows fight, you fight, otherwise shadows won't fight. [Some laughter.] It's all a shadow! There's no truth in it!<br>
To Me, it looks like that. It's all madness. What is there to fight?<br>
This is One World. Everybody is blessed by God. They all should enjoy His blessings: to enter into the Kingdom of God. He is the King. He is the One who is the Ruler.<br>
In His Kingdom, there is nothing like a state.<br>
So, that's a very different world you are entering into.<br>
<font color="DarkRed">There are no alternatives there! It's only one Absolute State of Mind, where you become the Spirit. That's all.</font><br>

Foods also, natural food you must eat, more natural food, than artificial. All that will give you a better living.<br>
<font color="DarkRed">And that is called as alternative, all right. That's alternative is important.</font><br>
But that doesn't mean you go on a bullock cart.<br>
You can export your trains to India, or your cars to India and get khādī from there. All right?<br>

"More so in places which are supposed to be developed. In developing that part of your systems you have exhausted yourself much more. I mean, it was all right up to a point. But when human beings know something, they'll go to the extreme end of everything.<br>
Now, if you know electricity, then everything must work on electricity: your lift will work on electricity, this will work on electricity. Now, computer have come, all right. Now, they will make human beings into electrical lid ... electrodes, I don't know what they are going to make out of that. I mean, going to that extent. Then ilectriti ... electricity fails, finished.<br>
Now, petrol started: petrol, use petrol as much as you like, all right. Now, petrol is getting exhausted.<br>
So there's a shock, [laughing:] future shock conditions: in a trauma we sit. In that confused state you are in a shocked state, 'Oh, God! What's going to happen to us?'<br>
But why play into the hands of these things to that extent?<br>
The countries which are not so developed, see, you can say countries which are little underdeveloped and developed, you see, where a motorcar runs and a bullock cart also runs: if the motorcar fails they can use the oxes [oxen] to run the motorcar[s]. We call it 'Ox Ford'. [Laughter.] 
<font color="DarkRed">So, one can rely [laughing:] on something else: there is an alternative already available.<br>
But when you cut out all the alternatives, then how can you find out in alternatives?</font><br>
For example, now we've got calculators. I was amazed in the shop: they can't count one, two, three, four, five. They, if they make mistakes in somewhere, if you tell them that, 'There's a mistake,' because you know how to calculate, they'll say, 'How can it be? Machine is not wrong.' 'But your fingers were wrong somewhere.'<br>
<font color="DarkRed">They have no alternative left now! I mean: they have to depend on the electricity; they have to depend on petrol; you have to depend on all these elements. So, if you find with little detachment: you are already slaves of all these elements. Instead of becoming free birds, we have become now slaves of this.<br>
So we start finding out alternatives. Now what can alternatives [laughing:] we can have?</font> We have lost all deftness to do any hand work. After some time I think people won't be even able to clean their dishes! [Soft laughter.] They will need a machine! As it is they can't clean their cloths, I think, they can't comb their hair. What's going to happen? You will need even a machine to feed you! Going to that extent.<br>
When we go up to such a limit that we become absolute slaves, the confusion is worsen."<br>

"Now the question about Sahaja Yoga is very simple to understand: all that is vital is extremely simple.<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"And then you have to have the detachment even of a kind of a collectivity that we think is collectivity. I call the fraternity of the bhūts, not collectivity. Always, all the useless Sahaja Yogis will form a group, and will have a very strong objection to everything that is sensible. And they will have suggestions for everything.<br>
There has to be no suggestions at all. There are no alternatives, because Śhiva is absolute. Once what He said is said! You just do it and see, that's the best. Alternatives will be second best or third best or maybe useless. But there is no alternative for Śhiva Tattwa.<br>
I'll give an example, I told Delhi people that, "You organize, say, program for seven days outside with other people." It was sensible because I knew it was to rain. At ... it has to rain also. Rain can be stopped, but it was to rain for all the other villagers, you see. We cannot stop them for only Sahaja Yogis, can we? Of course, Sahaja Yogis are important, so I said, "Let them be with other Sahaja Yogis." Now they started an alternative, only thinking that, 'You see, they won't be comfortable and ...' I mean it was good, but on a no ... other level that, 'They will not be comfortable with Sahaja Yogi,' another level.<br>
......<br>
So all these ideas of giving alternatives at the mental level is also wrong.<br>
I give any ... anything I say, immediately there will be ten suggestions. I try all these tricks with you. Because you are used to conferences, you see. [Laughter, laughs.] So I said, "All right, Subramanian [from New Delhi], what do you have to say about it?" [Laughter, smiles.] Because, after all, Lord Subramanian['s] mind is there, must ask him. Then I ask Venugopalan [from New Delhi], then I'll ask Gavin [Brown], Warren [Reeves], all these people. "Now what do you have to say?" And then they give their suggestion[s].<br>
But, if you see, in the conference of all the Divine Deities, there is no suggestion, no suggestion, no alternative. No alternatives to your Mother's ideas, nothing. Absolute, it's absolute. Nobody gives any suggestions to Me, never. No question. They won't listen to you, They won't listen to anyone. There's no question. Such harmony, complete obedience. And not only, They are fixed with Their qualities. They are told that you have to do it, They'll do it. [Snaps Her palms.] This is the difference.<br>
......<br>
Every time you do something, I tell you something, is just for you to learn something. I don't have to learn anything. Do you thinks that way, that I have to learn something now anymore? Not. So you have to learn something.<br>
And that is what if you understand, then a kind of a detachment will build in you and a surrender. You will be amazed your ... [you will] be so much relieved of nonsensical headaches that you have and the burdens you carry if you understand that, 'The whole joke, the whole work, the whole drama is done by Mother, on I am just playing into it.' There's so simple. That is to be felt, to be understood.<br>
And the enjoyment lies in that. Not in judging or finding alternatives. You try! Those who have tried it have enjoyed it very much."</font><br>
