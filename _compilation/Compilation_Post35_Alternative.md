<font color="DarkRed">"We aim to hold a conference where representatives from different religions around the world will come together to discuss how organized religions are lacking. The aim is to take the concept of a universal, 'pure' religion and to offer as an alternative a 'Universal Religion of the Spirit'."</font><br>

<b>Version 1:</b><br>
"You must say the mantras during Pūjā, but with complete śhraddhā. <font color="DarkRed">There is no alternative to śhraddhā.</font> When your śhraddhā is exquisite [profound], then only you should sit for a Pūjā. That way the Pūjā is done by heart. That time waves after waves of joy start flowing because when Ātmā Tattwa is the focal point there can not be any thoughts. The way people fill wine in a glass, same is with you performing Pūjā, your śhraddhā is the wine and the glass is nothing but the recitation of mantras and sādhana. While drinking this wine you are completely engrossed, with no thoughts, and you swim in this joy. How to express that joy in thoughts [words]? The wine which is inside the stomach, who is going to pour it back into a glass? And that too in an inferior glass made of thoughts. Joy after drinking this wine is eternal. It is your wealth. Many Pūjās like this have happened in front of Me and every time a big wave comes and takes you to a new shore. Those experiences from different shores become your own. They give grandness to your personality and open new doors of joy.<br>
It is best to do a Pūjā in the heart. If you can look at the Photo and then bring it into your heart, or after a Pūjā if you can bring that scene into your heart, then the joy of that moment can become permanent and will last for a long time. Read this letter to all Sahaja Yogis and send them copies of this letter."<br>
<br>
<b>Version 2:</b><br>
"You should say the Mantras in Pūjā but with great faith (śhraddhā). <font color="DarkRed">There is no alternative to śhraddhā.</font> You should perform the Pūjā when śhraddhā grows deep, so that heart itself gets all Pūjā performed. At that time waves of bliss start flowing because it is the Spirit that is saying, how can any thought come at that time? People pour their wine in the glass. Your Pūjā is like that. In that, wine is your faith and the glass is the recitation of Mantras and the worshiping. When you are drinking that wine forgetting everything, how can a thought come! Then only bathing in the Ocean of Bliss! How can that joy be expressed in thoughts? Who will pour that wine, back in the glass, which is to be drunk and that too in the inferior glass of thoughts? However, the joy that you get after drinking the wine is eternal and ever-present. It becomes your asset. Many such Pūjās have been performed in My presence. Every time a big wave comes and take you to a new land. Experiences of many such lands become your own. They give vastness to personality and open new gates of joy.<br>
Best is worshiping in the heart. If, the Photo by looking at it, can be placed in heart or, after the Pūjā, its view goes to heart, then the joy which you get only at that time, can become everlasting and ever-present. Show this letter, to all Sahaja Yogis and send its copies."<br>

<b>Version 1:</b><br><br>
"Now instead of thinking and planning, if they realize the planning of the Almighty, then they don't have to take that headache upon themselves. First understand God. Meaning, His All-pervading Power is doing all the planning by Itself. If you abide by that planning then all your tasks will work out beautifully. <font color="DarkRed">If instead you take it upon yourself, then you will always encounter some hindrances and obstacles.</font> You can see for yourself the state of our country due to the existing planning.

<font color="DarkRed">"There were some people who came to Me whom I called druggist or chemist. Means they used to be in state of coma. Such high consumption of drugs. But they got out of drugs from next day itself. Liquor, cigarette everything. Ninety-nine percent [99%].<br>
But one percent [1%] may still be stuck. Some are stubborn, but they should strive hard, and they do strive else one gets catches. Then you realize that there is a catch on the left Viśhuddhi, this and that. Then it pains. There is no alternative except removing the catch."</font><br>

"<font color="DarkRed">How there are ... there is no alternative for Sahaj Yog, no alternative, one must know. Everything that is living has no alternatives.</font><br>
<font color="DarkRed">For example, if a mango tree says that, 'I will create a pomegranate,' it cannot. There is no alternative.</font><br>
Whatever is there it has to see and enjoy. But not to force its way on [<font color="orange">unclear</font>].<br>
......<br>
Look at the little ones: how they came forward to give Me flowers, every step, every movement was so joyous, was creating such a beautiful delicate ripple in My heart. And it's written as history for Me to see these little, little sweet, innocent Gaṇeśhas coming forward.<br>
That in wisdom becomes so [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] that you know the Source of Love as Gaṇeśha [<font color="orange">unclear</font>]. <font color="DarkRed">For He did not know anything else but one that which is the Source of Love. Never questioned. Never argued, no alternative. No new ideas came into head, He's just steadying in.</font>"<br>

"Now if you say: 'Which is the way a flower has to become a fruit?' There's only one way! [Laughing:] There have no two ways. <font color="DarkRed">Living things do not have two ways and five alternatives.</font> These are all for human beings to take lots of decisions and [laughs] do all these things. But for any living thing, it's only one way it works out.<br>
And that's how it is the germination within you, which is a living force of the Living God, is the only way: is the Kuṇḍalinī awakening. <font color="DarkRed">And that's why we can say, Sahaja is the only way! It is! There's no other way out!</font>"<br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> So-o, to become closer to God, you have to be closer to God. That's as simple as that.<br>
I mean somebody would say: `How do I know that I know that ... what ... how to drive a car?' When you know. `How do I know I [laughing:] can drive a bike?' Say, for example somebody says, `How can I use a bike?' I mean when you are that you are that! I mean is there any other way out? `How will I say I've got eyes?' When you can see! Finished! I mean it's so simple as that.<br>
So, how can you say you are nearer to God? You yourself will know you are nearer to God. Because the joy of being that tells you.<br>
You need not be close to Me, you need not be touching My Feet, you could be anywhere in the forest, you could be very close to Me, and those who thing [] they are close to Me because they can make a little face and, you know, behave in a very artificial way or some dramatic styles, you see, they are very far away.<br>
And those who cannot understand the commands of the brain are useless things!<br>
Now supposing one nail starts growing big, all right, and piercing inside the skin, we'll take it out, isn't it? There's not listening to the brain!<br>
<b>Sahaja Yogi:</b> [<font color="orange">unclear</font>].<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> We'll have to throw it out!<br>
<b>Another Sahaja Yogi:</b> [<font color="orange">unclear</font>].<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> Any malignant growth is that growth which goes beyond the control of the brain, of the central nervous system. If the parasympathetic cannot control a growth of a particular cell, that is a malignant cell!<br>
So, if you become malignant in Sahaja Yoga, you may think you are a very great person or very some thing. You may think, you will be thrown out. Because you are a disease! You are a diseased person. You'll be thrown out.<br>
<font color="DarkRed">So to be reluh ... relevant, is to be relevant! There's no alternative for that.</font><br>

"Like Blake has said, that, "Men of God will become Prophets, and the ... these Prophets will have powers to make others Prophets."<br>
He said it so clearly for you English people, but I don't think you people like Him very much. [Laughing:] Because ... because the way peo... few people I have seen, who really appreciate Blake. And some of them have said that, ``He is mad!" Naturally, among all the mad people, a sane person may look mad also. But He is the one who has so clearly said.<br>
And in this country, this great man should be born, and should talk about Jerusalem, is remarkable!<br>
Because you cannot think, in England, where people just believe in dominating other countries and using the ... their power to dominate others, you could get Jerusalem established!<br>
But what He said was of these days, when those false ideas have dropped off, when people do not think of domination, they do not think of materialism, they are fed up with all these things, and they are seeking today.<br> 
And who are these seekers? These seekers are the men of God.<br>
So, recognize yourself. First of all, you must recognize your Self before recognizing anybody else, that you are seekers and that you are men of God.<br>
<font color="DarkRed">Unless and until you have found God, you are not going to be happy by all these nonsensical ... uh-uh-uh ... alternatives people are giving.</font>"<br>

"I mean, you may, in your myth, you see, hallucination, think it is different, and fight.<br>
It's, I ... I sometimes feel you are just fighting your shadows! This is the, you have created shadows, and the shadows are fighting. And just to make the shadows fight, you fight, otherwise shadows won't fight. [Some laughter.] It's all a shadow! There's no truth in it!<br>
To Me, it looks like that. It's all madness. What is there to fight?<br>
This is One World. Everybody is blessed by God. They all should enjoy His blessings: to enter into the Kingdom of God. He is the King. He is the One who is the Ruler.<br>
In His Kingdom, there is nothing like a state.<br>
So, that's a very different world you are entering into.<br>
<font color="DarkRed">There are no alternatives there! It's only one Absolute State of Mind, where you become the Spirit. That's all.</font><br>
......<br>
Foods also, natural food you must eat, more natural food, than artificial. All that will give you a better living.<br>
<font color="DarkRed">And that is called as alternative, all right. That's alternative is important.</font><br>
But that doesn't mean you go on a bullock cart.<br>
You can export your trains to India, or your cars to India and get khādī from there. All right?<br>
Mu... mutual understanding. Because we are part and parcel of one Whole.<br>
And we just cannot exist by our only growth because then we become malignant, you see. One cells eats another. They ... you have to!<br>
If you have a machinery, you have to eat other! Because you produce so much, you must find markets for them, you must supply them, you must send over. Then you must have other countries to exploit them!"<br>
