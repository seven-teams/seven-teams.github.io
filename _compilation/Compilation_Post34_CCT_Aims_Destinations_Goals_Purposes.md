<font color="DarkRed">"You can attain any destination that you fix. All your autosuggestions will materialize.</font> The remedy that is to be used is: your attention should be on Me and you should make the following conditioning of thoughts on your Āgñyā "How fortunate we are to have been realized! We are Sahaja Yogis. God has chosen us. How can we work if we remain weak? Ādi Śhakti has given us the power to redeem the whole mankind. We can do it and we will do it." On heart you should criticize with these thoughts "How deep is God's love for us! He has given us the Realization. He is the Ocean of Mercy. Ignoring all our mistakes, He is working hard day and night for our welfare and, instead of praying for His forgiveness of our mistakes, we are making complaints against Him and blaming Him!" The following thoughts will please your hearts, "O God, please give us the Power of Your Love. May I be the drop in the Ocean of Your Love that is enveloping the whole universe, so that its loving pulsation is vibrated through My life and I remain engrossed in that bliss." "<br>

"To emerge out victoriously of these two dangerous jaws of destruction is only possible if the leaders of the nations get self realization through sahaja yoga and are enlightened by Self Knowledge and the Knowledge of the collective. (This would manifest on their central nervous system). <font color="DarkRed">Thus appearing on the stage of reality as Lotuses of Divinity spreading the fragrance of human ascent into its glorious destination.

"It is thus that the human beings constitute the best reflectors of the Creator. <font color="DarkRed">Some of them as sages, like Lord Buddha, Jesus Christ, Lord Mahavir, mark the destination of human progress, others as scientist discover the mighty forces of creation which are being constantly harnessed in the service of man.</font> Similarly, some others gifted with extraordinary faculties of perception and understanding play the role of "Artists". They have not only an extra-ordinary "eye" but also an ability to communicate with others through the medium of art. They have an extremely sensitive heart and an equally eloquent medium by which they can touch the hearts of their fellowmen. This factor assumes a social importance and thus an artist plays a vital role, as member of a society."<br'

"<font color="DarkRed">Mister Phaḍake, chakras and their colors don't mean everything. You have to go further ahead than that. These colors mean only a particle of the sea or sand. We have to reach to the complete sand as a whole.</font> These colors are like the scenes we pass while traveling by train. We don't remember the scenes and get involved in them. We just have a destination to reach. We forget all that we pass on the way, in between. In the same way attention should not go to the colors you pass on the way to Sahasrāra. How the thoughtless awareness comes. How it should be established for long time. This should be observed. Only looking at the colors will reduce the attention at Sahasrāra and it will be spoiled." [<b> Variant:</b> "Aho Phaḍake, colors of the chakras is not everything. <font color="DarkRed">You still have a long way to go. These colors are only like a drop of water in the ocean. We have to cross all these.</font> When we are traveling in a train, several scenes cross before our eyes, do we remember all of them? Our attention is on our destination. We forget what happens in between. Similarly, do not bother about the colors. Your attention should be on the Sahasrār. How will thoughtlessness come? How can we make it stay for a long time? Your attention should be on these things. If you keep seeing colors, you will only end up doing trāṭak on the Āgñyā chakra and it will get spoilt."]<br>

"But today you are those chosen flowers, chosen over the ages, to blossom so that today your vibrations and your fragrance should spread across the world, cleanse its sludge and eliminate the filth of this Ocean of Illusion.<br>
When looking at it, one may wonder, 'How it is possible, Mātājī is making a big statement?' <font color="DarkRed">But this is a continuation (silasilā) and, when the Destination has arrived in front you, then thinking, 'Why it has arrived? How has it come? How can this happen? When you were walking, did the destination not arrive? When you were seeking, will you not get your place?'!</font><br>
......<br>
<font color="DarkRed">The Destination has arrived. You all have reached courtyard. How easy and sahaja is all this.</font>"<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"As Christ had said, "I am the Light, I am the Path," same is My statement, "I am the Destination, not only the Path."<br>
I did not say this to you because I had very bad experiences. This is the only reason. You people have to come to My refuge (śharaṇāgat). You have to accept Me as Mother and live like My sons. Without that your work will not be done.</font>"<br>

<b>Version 1:</b><br>
<font color="DarkRed">"Have I to say like Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, "Leave all religions and surrender to Me" or as Śhrī Jesus, "I am the way, I am the door."<br>
I want to tell that I am that Man̄jil (Destination). But will you people accept it? Will this fact go to your hearts?"</font><br>
<br>
<b>Version 2:</b><br>
<font color="DarkRed">"Will I have to say like Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa said, "Give up all other duties and surrender only to me," or like Jesus Christ said, "I am the path and I am the entrance."<br>
What I want to tell you is that, 'I am your final aim.' But will you all accept this? Will this message of mine enter your hearts?"</font><br>
