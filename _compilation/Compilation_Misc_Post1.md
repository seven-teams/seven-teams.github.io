Dear Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginīs,<br>
<br>
Jay Śhrī Mātājī!<br>
<br>
In this email we would like to say a few things about our team, Comprehensive Compilations Team, such as how it is structured, how it works, how it hopes to evolve, etc. Through this we hope you will know us even better and also would like to help us more or give us more elaborate feedback.<br>
The team was created in 2014 with the idea of having four members covering the main areas of the database minus websites: English, Hindi, Marathi, and technical aspects such as files, etc.<br>
In July 2017, after Guru Puja, one Sahaja Yogi visited a member of our team and he was so impressed with the CCT database that he envisioned websites for it. In due time (Sep. 2018) he created the Eternal Moments which is now maintained by CCT.<br>
So, since Sep. 2018 we envision a fifth member of the team covering websites.<br>
Well, so far we have not reached five members. As such, the current three members are often covering several of the five main areas.<br>
Since its creation, the team has always been independent, nonaligned, fully involved at all levels of the database, dedicated to quality, comprehensiveness, accuracy, nonediting, sharing, crediting all sources, and aiming to share everything in due time on dedicated, independent, nonaligned, well-dedicated, self-promoted websites.<br>
It operates under very strict and clear-cut unwritten rules. For instance, the team, regardless of what its individual members might think, respects all listed and unlisted video links (as at the time of sharing). Also, the team does not upload any video/audio/pdf files (of documents/publications) unless it has the appropriate permission to do it (such as materials scanned by or received by the team, video digitized by or received by the team, etc.). In particular, it makes no sense to our team to in any way download and reupload a video/audio/pdf unless it has the permission to do it, as giving credit is very important and as it is so easy to embed in a website a video/audio/pdf in a manner in which all original sources are neatly traceable. Moreover, among pdf files of publications, only once we came across one which had a wrong title, so there is relatively little or next to nothing to offer in terms of accuracy to pdf files.<br>
The rules for Photos are a bit different as usually Photos are not titled, do not come from known sources, and have multiple versions; so, as long as we can offer substantial contribution to titles or in exceptional cases start an empty gallery or help to make a sequence of Photos of an evident more complete, few Photos might be uploaded without a clear-cut permission.<br>
To begin with, basic independent teams have been formed (such as the Yearly Topics Team, Scriptures Team, CCT, etc.). You can see them posting, and the posts implicitly define subteams whether they are named as such or not.<br>
The team views public growth as one step at a time. So far we reached Step 3, and there are so many more steps that one would not even like to count them. But of course, from its inception, the team has a well-defined picture of the whole database such as how it ought to look once it is essentially completed, etc.<br>
Step 1, the very foundation of the database, is the database of transcripts/quotes, <font color="blue"><b>Divine Message</b></font>, and we are very fortunate to have a website for it since 2019 due to volunteers helping the team. The link <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/divine/">Divine Message</a> is part of the website where all the posts of the teams are shared.<br>
Step 2 is the website <a href="https://eternalmoments.smugmug.com/">Eternal Moments</a> of Photographs of Shri Mataji and of photos Moments of Joy.<br>
Step 3 is the archives at the link <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/archives/">Archives</a>, which, among other things, contains one single table that will gradually contain the whole archives' data.<br>
We are looking forward to the next steps. Your kind contribution, help, support and sharing has been and it will always be very much appreciated.<br>
The team would benefit a lot from being joined by one or two members who would like to take active roles in websites or Hindi.<br>
