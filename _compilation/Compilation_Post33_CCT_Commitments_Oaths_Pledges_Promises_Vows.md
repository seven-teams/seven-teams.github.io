<font color="DarkRed">"A couple of days ago, I asked people to promise that they would no longer consume alcohol, and half of them got up and left.

"Now we have got, astrologically there are three and a half auspicious days where you don't have to consultant any uh ... any books of astrology, which are called as Pañchāṅg, to find out whether it is an auspicious time or not. For any Pūjā, for any [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] good work you have to do, people consultant, in India, the Pañchāṅg, is the book to find out which date is auspicious [and] which is not.<br>
One of them is today. Is a day you can do anything good, you decide anything good. <font color="DarkRed">Today is the day to take an oath, to think of something great, to visualize something big, to ask a boon, to do a big Pūjā, is one of the greatest uh day.</font> One of the, we call them muhūrtas, which where you do not consultant these books.<br>
And that's why rājyābhiṣhek of, I mean the crowning ceremony of Śhrī Rāma took place on this day."<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today, in the Presence of Śhrī Gaṇeśha, you have to take an oath, that, 'Whatever is the past of my country, I will get opposite to that!'<br>
......<br>
So, the second oath we have to take before Śhrī Gaṇeśha is: that, 'I will be honest to myself. I will not deceive myself, for anybody's sake!'<br>
......<br>
So, with the third oath you have to take: that, 'For us, our Mother is so powerful, why should we be afraid of anything‽ If She is going to give us the wisdom, why should we try to seek it anywhere else‽'<br>
......<br>
The another oath we have to take today: that, 'We'll respect every Sahaja Yogi from our heart, because they are made in the form of Śhrī Gaṇeśha. We'll not make fun of them. We'll not laugh at them.'<br>
As long as they are in Sahaja Yoga, we have to respect [them]. But they can be thrown away, they can get out of it.<br>
But unless and until this happens, do not put your ego on other people. Don't think that you understand everything. Don't think that you know everything.<br>
Respect each and every person. N... not to what he has read or for what he has learnt, but because he is a Great Soul."</font><br>

"Now, the ... celebration of Diwālī should be that we carry the light all over the world and enlighten people, as many as we can. None of our private things, no... none of our own problems are important. So the, that what it is: that we have to realize that we have got a certain position, which no one has in this world. So, once you understand, your own esteem goes up, and you see for yourself what you have to do!<br>
<font color="DarkRed">So then, everybody should, today, decide and take an oath, that, 'We'll do everything to spread Sahaja Yoga with humility.'</font> "<br>
