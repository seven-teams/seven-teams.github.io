"What is called salvation? Why have we come into this world? Why did human being originate? Why was human made in a special form? Why did God give so many powers to this beautiful organism through a special artwork (kalākṛiti)?<br>

But what is the meaning of Sachchidānand? First of all this is the Truth. Now we keep saying that, 'This is the Truth,' 'That is Truth,' 'We saw that this is the Truth.' Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya has said that, "Only Brahma is the Truth, all others are false." 'Rest all is illusion,' what is the meaning of this? 'This is the Truth and everything else is illusion,' means what?<br>
The meaning of this is that whatever vyavahār [conduct, behavior] we are doing [having] today, whatever we are vyavahār [performimg, practicing] today, we are doing it blindly, and when we get to know the form of the Spirit, at that time our practice becomes sighted (ḍoḷas), the truth can be seen."<br>

"So He had to create this creation in such a way, that He could create His own image, reflect it, and make it enjoy itself. It's a very mutual appreciation, as we call it, āndolan. Whatever He does for us, is for His own pleasures. But the beauty of it is that: your pleasure is His pleasure. And the other way round is: His pleasure should be your pleasure, too.<br>
<font color="DarkRed">Once that becomes the fact that the pleasure of God becomes your pleasure, you enter into that beautiful arena of Heavenly Joy: Swargīya Ānand.</font><br>
Only if it is one-sided enterprise or one-sided effort, it gets lost. Human efforts are one-sided. But God's efforts are such that they cannot be enjoyed then unless and until they are reflected back."<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"In Sahaja Yoga, as you grow from one to another, there are different types of ānandas.<br>
Like we can say, the Spirit, when you see the Spirit, you get an ānand, called Swānanda. That means you feel your Spirit yourself, and you feel very happy. Then you give Realization to others, you get Parānanda, joy of others. But when you get the enjoyment of well-being, in health and materially all right and everything all right, everything in saṃtoṣha, in complete satisfaction, then it's Brahmānanda. And like that you start feeling higher and higher joys within yourself. Because your nerves start opening to new dimensions.<br>
So you can say that at the Kṛiṣhṇa level, you get Kṛiṣhṇānanda, where you get the sweetness, the mādhurya. And when you see your generosity, then you get Śhivānanda. And when you are with children, you get Gaṇeśhānanda. And that can be described, all those can be described, but Nirānand cannot be described, because it's Mahāmāyā's Joy. All these joys put together is Nirānanda. So there is no place for ego and superego at all. The complete Sahasrāra is opened out, and nothing but the complete rapport is established with the Divine.<br>
And there is a pouring of light all the time in the head and the light going back, that you have seen in My Photograph. As if the Sahasrāra becomes like a sucking child from the Universal Mother, sucking the joy inside, and it is again reflecting back. It would be like the waves reach the shores and then they are again repleted, they go back and then they form a pattern.<br>
Now the joy out of that pattern, how can you describe? The only thing about Nirānanda is, that you have Mahāmāyā so close and so far away, that's the speciality.<br>
Completely thoughtless, silence there, complete silence, you don't think. It's just silence you cannot put into words any more, because the words break with the force of the Ānanda. They cannot hold it."</font><br>

"But the first nihi means without, devoid, and nira means sheer. <font color="DarkRed">Like when you say Nirānanda, Nirātma: Sheer Ātmā, Sheer Joy. Kevalam, the only. There's nothing but Joy. But this one is used, nira or nihi, used in two forms as I told you: one for saying of ... without or devoid of, the another form is [for saying] the only, absolute, the absolute.<br>
So here the joy becomes Nirānanda: Absolute Joy, nothing but joy. It's complete freedom. So you have all kinds of joys, as I told you before: you have Swānanda, the joy of the Spirit, then you have got Brahmānand, the joy of well-being, you've got Līlānanda, Kṛiṣhṇānand, where you have the joy of the play. But when you reach the State of Sahasrāra it is Nirānand: means Sheer, Absolute Joy.<br>
Though the name Nirā is My name, it means Absolute. So, when you put such an adjective before anything else, it becomes absolute. Thus you become absolute. And when you are at that State of Absolute, then there is no place for anything else to be there but your Self.<br>
......<br>
 So this is what, at Sahasrāra you get Nirānanda.<br>
In different stages of Sahaja Yoga we had to start from Śharīrānanda, means the ā... ānand of the body, Mānasānanda, the joy of the mānasa, is the psyche. Then you can say Ahaṅkārānanda, where you have to have the satisfaction of the ego. But the state has now to be established within us is of Nirānanda.</font>"<br>

But what do they achieve in this Pūjā? <font color="DarkRed">"My sister has become all right," "My brother has got the blessings," but did you get Śhivānand [Joy of the Spirit]?

<b>Version 1:</b><br>
<font color="DarkRed">"Today while singing the praises of Lord Śhiva the same feeling comes. This Śhakti has been given by Lord Śhiva that is why He is called Ānand Dāyak. There are several constituents of this joy like, Nirānand, Ātmānand, Āhlād ... these resonate with our emotions as a flower resonates with fragrance. In the same way the pure, beautiful, noble feelings in our hearts towards something is āhlād by which we are enthralled. Then there is no desire for anything else."</font><br>
<br>
<b>Version 2:</b><br>
<font color="DarkRed">"The joy felt by singing Śhrī Śhiva Stuti earlier today, that is because of Śhrī Śhiva. Śhrī Śhiva gives us this ability to be joyous. That is why He is called 'Joy Giver'. The pure joy felt in joy, just joy, there are many types of joy, Ātmānand and Āhlād. This joy is related to our feelings. The feelings in our heart, the good, generous, beautiful loving pure ones of beauty, love, etc. spread fragrance like a flower spreads its fragrance. This is pure joy. In such a joy we are happy and joyous. And as a result we do not need anything else."</font><br>

"Realized Souls have to ascend gradually in their surrender to the innocence of Śhrī Gaṇeśha. People who are simple and chaste like small children, those who are not dominated by dogmatic or fanatical minds, achieve their spontaneous Self-realization (Sahaja Yoga) almost immediately in the mere proximity of highly evolved and God-realized personalities (<i>Avatāras</i>). They feel the sensation of joy on their central nervous system, and as the light of its awareness gradually increases, they experience very unique sensations of bliss. These sensations can be differentiated and also recognized by practice. <font color="DarkRed">In Sanskrit there are four names given to the four kinds of joy experienced by the development of these four types of rippled identities:<br>
<br>
1. <i>Paramānanda</i><br>
<br>
2. <i>Sahajānanda</i><br>
<br>
3. <i>Vīrānanda</i><br>
<br>
4. <i>Yogānanda</i><br>
