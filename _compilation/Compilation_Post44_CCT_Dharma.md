"There have been several Incarnations on this Earth who have always said to know your Spirit because without finding his Spirit a human being cannot find God. Just as without eyes we cannot identify colors, similarly without knowing the Spirit, through arguments, we cannot obtain God. Through brains we cannot know God. It is through the Spirit only we can know God. <font color="DarkRed">Till now everybody has said that, "You rise in your dharma and find your Spirit. Know the Spirit which is within you."</font> "<br>

"Today, Sahaja Yoga has reached the state of Mahā Yoga, which is en masse evolution manifested through it. <font color="DarkRed">It is this day's Yuga Dharma.</font> It is the way the Last Judgment is taking place. Announce it to all the Seekers of Truth, to all the nations of the world, so that nobody misses the blessings of the Divine to achieve their meaning, their Absolute, their Spirit."<br>

"Carbon has four valencies, gold has the property that it is untarnishable.<br>
<font color="DarkRed">Similarly, dharma is the sterling quality which is sustenance of mankind. Man has evolved from an amoeba to this stage, through his dharma, which is the code of law of evolution. This code of life protects and nourishes our spiritual growth. It gives us balance and a state to ascend in our evolutionary process.</font><br>
Without balance how can we ascend?"<br>

"The central channel begins at the Mūlādhāra and passes straight up into the highest chakra of Sahasrāra. <font color="DarkRed">Only partly active up to the human stage, it expresses the evolutionary power of the Virāṭa (sattvaguṇa), virtue and righteousness (dharma) and the Power of Awareness (Jñāna Śhakti).</font><br>
......<br>
The Suṣhumṇā is the central channel for our evolution. It is through this channel that we become collectively conscious and all the disparate factors of our being are integrated in one whole. It makes the connection between our conscious mind and the 'auto' of the autonomic nervous system, the Spirit, which is the reflection of God. <font color="DarkRed">Suṣhumṇā is the Way of Dharma, the straight and narrow path by which we pass through the gate of the Āgñyā chakra to enter into the Kingdom of God in the Sahasrāra.</font><br>
So with the Sahasrāra open and the connection with Suṣhumṇā established, we are open to the source of all awareness where all knowledge dwells, and is sustained by the Primordial Source of All Power (Ādi Śhakti). Meditation in thoughtless awareness is the key to the development of a strong Suṣhumṇā. <font color="DarkRed">Another basic requirement is to enjoy a virtuous and dhārmik life. After Realization, try to keep in thoughtless awareness as much as possible, with attention centered in Suṣhumṇā nāḍī, the channel of the eternal present, where the only time is 'now'. In this way, with Kuṇḍalinī awakening, we transcend time and space.</font>"<br>

"There is a difference between innocence and ignorance. Innocence understands and responds to love without expectations or sense of gaining something out of love. He has no sense of gaining anything out of love. <font color="DarkRed">Without innocence you cannot be dhārmik. Unless innocence is embedded in dharma it has no meaning.<br>
......<br>
You may be adhārmik but after Kuṇḍalinī awakening you become dhārmik.</font> "<br>

"x <font color="DarkRed">Sustenance (Dharma) in the creation is the essence that expresses character.</font> For example Gold has the sustenance that it does tarnish. Anything that is yellow or glittering is not gold. In the same way water has the quality of sustenance that it cleanses or dissolves many things and does not dissolve some things. <font color="DarkRed">The human sustenance expressed in a nutshell as ten commandments. That was the time to let human beings know the essence of their quality. What they do and what they do not.<font color="DarkRed"> Later on it would be discussed in details in the Chapter of Manipura Chakra."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"For example human beings are evolved and have sense of dirt[,] filth and untidiness but animals are not aware of it.

"Then the third one, I said, was Swāhā -- the Nābhī, is the consumption.

"Kuṇḍalinī awakening is an event such that this power rises above from within your triangular bone, pierces through six plexuses [chakras] and comes out from Brahmarandhra [hole in fontanel bone].<br>
<font color="DarkRed">Until this event takes place within you, sometimes it's fruitless to talk about dharma [religion].</font> Because talks may perhaps make you a good human being but one cannot get Self-realization.<br>
Unless Self-realization is achieved, all powers within us cannot be expressed. Understand that it is final and ultimate goal of our evolution. When Kuṇḍalinī is awakened, It pierces the Brahmarandhra but post this connection, the Yoga has to be established. Not for too long but meditation for a short while has to be practiced every day.<br>
......<br>
<font color="DarkRed">Another big change that happens is sense of righteousness (dharma) is awakened within us, it's within and not without.</font><br>
For example, any Hindi, Muslim or Christian can commit any sin or do wrong deeds, his religion has no binding upon him. <font color="DarkRed">But it's such a thing that once dharma is awakened within, you cannot commit anything illicit.</font><br>
Compassion, mercy, etc. are awakened within you and despite this you become extremely energetic and dynamic. Whatever you keep doing, you won't feel tired. You do your work in very loving and peaceful way.<br>
With this, you attain peace with you, become absolutely peaceful. A person who has very angry temperament becomes absolutely calm. Because whatever angularities you have within, become all right. All deformities within us are due to problems in plexuses [chakras] and once these chakras become all right, they get all right.<br>
......<br>
This work is going on in seven[ty] countries. Thousands of people get together, but never ever there is any tussle. All live-in harmony together. Yes, sometimes they do tease each other but jokingly, in a friendly manner. You would not have seen such friendships otherwise. Whether this person is from Russia, England, Japan or anywhere they build a collective love amongst themselves.<br>
 <font color="DarkRed">Because of this, when true religion (dharma) is awakened within, they understand that all religions are one, understand totality of all religions. You don't criticize any religion and worship all Dharma Pravartaka [Founder(s) of Religion].</font>"<br>
