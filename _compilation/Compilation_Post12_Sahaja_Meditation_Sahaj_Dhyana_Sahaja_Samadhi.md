Jai Shri Mataji

Please find attached the pdf file of quotes on <font color="blue">sahaja meditation, sahaj dhyana, and sahaja samadhi</font>obtained by searching for all possible root combinations such as "<font color="red">sahaj sam</font>" and "<font color="red">sahaja sam</font>". If by chance extra such quotes are found out, please kindly share them with all of us.<br>

Please kindly share the file with all our brothers and sisters. 

We would like to thank several American Sahaja Yoginis and Yoginis who had suggested this topic and we apologize to all of them for the quite long delay.
