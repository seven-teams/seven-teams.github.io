<p>
Dear Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginīs,<br>
<br>
Jay Śhrī Mātājī!<br>
<br>
As an offering to the Lotus Feet of Shri Mataji, we have started Step 8 of the database this month.<br>
Main link: <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/tag-folder/"><font color="CornflowerBlue"><b>Short Prose Pieces Tag Folder</b></font></a>.<br>
Additional link where the chain of all short prose pieces related Posts will be shared: <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/folder/"><font color="CornflowerBlue"><b>Short Prose Pieces Folder</b></font></a>.<br>
The Folder Subteam will start today bimonthly newsletters on the short prose pieces uploaded on even months (from now on).<br>
[Note: in order to alternate with Step 9, the change from monthly to bimonthly was made on 2024-1129.]<br> 
Please kindly share the post, the news and the links with all our brothers and sisters.<br>
