"... the Kuṇḍalinī, the residual Divine Power, resides in the triangular bone at the base of the spine. It is the germinating power of the seed of your being. This seed sprouts through Sahaja Yoga. I am like the gardener who pours some water on the seeds which he has planted in his garden. At first, only a few flowers come up, but at the time of the blossoming the phenomenon of en masse Self-realization is manifested. <font color="red">This Divine Love that I pour is your own right for this is the culminating point of the human evolution which has been promised by the Scriptures.</font>
......
<font color="red">Can you conceive of an energy which thinks, organizes, feels and love?</font><br>
......<br>
<font color="red">If love cannot blossom in the optimum conditions of marriage how can it blossom out of it? How can the whole world know love?</font><br>
......<br>
They [husband and wife] are not similar but both are equal, no doubt! One is the right and the other the left wheel of the chariot. If one wheel is bigger than the other, the chariot cannot move properly. Both must be respected. The husband-wife relationship has to be absolutely informal; all artificiality must be dropped. <font color="red">They must love and also sometimes quarrel to show their concern. This is the sign of a healthy relationship. But a woman has to behave like a woman and man has to be like a man. Spontaneous fidelity, love and mutual sharing are the only way one can give and receive the joy of married life.</font> The slightest deviation from conjugal fidelity must be absolutely avoided, and if committed, openly confessed. A person who does not believe in a one-woman one-man relationship should not marry at all; why make another person unhappy? The effects of secret infidelity are of the worst kind and can ruin the whole society?<br>
......<br>
What sin can you commit that I cannot devour? <font color="red">You know, the Devī's Love is like the bottom of the ocean; no matter how big the ocean is, its bottom is always bigger.</font><br>
......<br>
[Related to the seekers that come to public programs and then they fizzle out due to the escapism that, 'Śhrī Mātājī is too pure and too great':] <font color="red">The ocean of sin cannot be greater than the heart of your Lord who loves you.</font> He can drink all the poison. Come back.<br>
......<br>
<font color="red">I think your childhood must have been very harsh, that is why you do not know the art of love.</font><br>
......<br>
<font color="red">Love is much more powerful than all the hatred of the world.</font>"<br>

<font color="red">"This is the era of Enlightenment. One can see and feel the bubbling of new idioms in our creative world of art, music and all that is beautiful and joy-giving. Integration is the key note of this new regeneration of universal tones. These tones are ripples of the harmonic, dynamic undercurrent music of the Universal Divine Love.</font><br>
<font color="red">Is there a possibility of this love expressed in the unity of human beings with God Almighty giving a new vision to the apparent diversities?</font><br>
Is it possible that this unique happening is accessible to many, that they may see their own creative world revolving in the great universe of All-pervading Power?<br>
My only answer is, 'Yes.'<br>
My only question is, 'Why not?' "<br>

"Magnanimity of mind is very pleasing and it attracts others. This magnanimity lies within human being and is awakened by Kuṇḍalinī. But how can those people have this joy of spontaneity who are living in artificial atmosphere? Although Kuṇḍalinī has been awakened and She has pierced Brahmarandhra yet heart must be pierced. <font color="red">But some Sahaja Yogis have hearts like stones, absolutely devoid of love; they use sarcastic words while talking to others and want to show that they are great. On many occasions I have seen, people push others or shout at others even in My presence. Particularly, when you shout at the children, I feel pain in My heart. At least Sahaja Yogis should have deep love for each other. When you know that you are the children of the same Mother, why do you look down upon some people? Are you perfect? Are there no faults in you? We only talk of Universal Love. If you have no love for each other amongst you, then in which mankind will it be seen? All I want to tell you is to clean your minds of venomous thoughts that you have for other Sahaja Yogis.</font><br>
If a Sahaja Yogi visits your town, invite him, look after him, as if he is your brother. His happiness will purify your homes. I cannot understand how there can be groups among the Sahaja Yogis, because every moment your condition is improving or going down.<br>
Know that making such groups is disastrous. <font color="red">Look at the good qualities of others and enjoy their love.</font> Don't worry about their bad qualities. Leave them for Me. You will realize in meditation that this is the only way of opening the fountains of bliss."<br>

"<font color="red">When you start feeling love, respect and awe towards God Almighty, it's a sign that your faith and belief, that God Almighty is all-powerful and also that He takes care of us, has established.</font> God Almighty is always showering us with blessings and His Grace. God Almighty is ever compassionate. You cannot imagine how much compassionate God Almighty is. <font color="red">He is extremely compassionate but equally merciless. It is impossible to survive His wrath. Nothing can stop Him, not even My Love.</font> God Almighty will say that I have given a lot of freedom, lenience to all My children. And that's why they have spoilt. That's why I ask that you do not get into any wrong doings and do not discredit your Mother. I remind you again not to lose your precious time in wasteful activities but completely imbibe Sahaja Yoga."<br>

<font color="red">"The greatest mistake is to close one's heart. However hurt one may be, remember that within there is someone who always loves you. She is your individual mother, your Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
She is connected to the All-pervading Power of Divine Love, which never abandons you.<br>
In Her Love, there are no expectations. There is only a tender glow that takes us to Her presence."</font><br>

"<font color="red">Human love means possession and determination.<br>
Divine Love soothes you, It raises you to a new awareness. It is something that's just flowing. Not rationality, nothing. It is to feel, feeling for the pain of others. Feeling for their longing and feeling for their aspirations. Just feel within.</font><br>
With Yoga [Self-realization] we become collectively conscious. We can feel our centers and that of others on the fingertips. As Muhammad Sāhib had said, ``At the Time of Resurrection, your fingers will speak."<br>
The Namāz has the real ritual to know the Spirit.<br>
The Pūjās and worship all pour joy on our central nervous system. We feel the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost, the Chaitanya Laharī in living experience. We become one with the Divine and the rapport is established. The Divine Vibrations indicate and the coding if we know them, we know their meanings. <font color="red">Love has its own bondage -- very sweet and beautiful. We have to know the waves of the Divine Ocean of Grace and enjoy them.</font><br>
If a child comes and spoils our house then we should enjoy the fun of spoiling. If our freedom is challenged by a little child's crying, we are not a wise person. It's abandonment, it's loneliness, it's cutting off from the Primordial One that we are not being able to tolerate other people's freedom. We have to be truly free. When a little child cannot cry in its own home, what kind of freedom is that? If a child cannot eat what he wants in his own home what kind of freedom is that? <font color="red">Of course, this freedom is to be pruned, nourished and developed in the Correct Way of Love.</font>"<br>

"Kuṇḍalinī gives Self-knowledge, that is She points out problems on chakras. She is the pure desire, meaning chaste desire. There is no lust, greed, anything and She is your own individual mother. She knows everything about you and is absolutely the knowledge.<br>
<font color="red">She is the pure light of knowledge, love, compassion and attention. She is the tremendous force within, the storehouse of compassion, love and knowledge and Ocean of Forgiveness. She is the power which is Absolute Purity, auspiciousness, pure love, detachment, concern, enlightened attention and joy.</font> She gives Witness State, peace, security, and wisdom ..."<br>

<font color="red">"Dear Sahaja Yogis, lots of love to all of you!<br>
You all lovingly came to Santa Cruz [Airport in Mumbai] in the rain but we could only meet for a moment. You showered so much love on Me that I was completely overwhelmed. I was so delighted by it that vibrations from different chakras continuously started flowing through every pore of My body. Many chakras that were dormant until now became active. I was witnessing a miracle of your love. Keep sending such pure love. I bless you that you all will achieve all the infinite that is beyond this mahāmāyā.<br>
This love is not the regular human love and is like Ambrosia. It is like a drizzle but there are waves of the ocean behind it. That ocean has decided to drench you. You should remember that the actions of Me going away from you or Me running towards you, are the two ropes used for churning. I enjoy this as a witness. My chakras are the churner that are churning you and the butter of love comes up. I am standing just like a pole -- immovable and inevitable.<br>
You are worthy of this love. You should stay immersed in that love and share it with others.</font> And distributing this Nectar is the only condition. That Kṛiṣhṇa who stole the butter to share with others should be awakened in you. Somehow you must acquire that butter. As the plane was delayed, I was thinking that you all must be waiting and how it will all work out, and I would have thanked God if you had gone back. I am your innocent Mother. <font color="red">Sometimes I get angry at you when you make a mistake but you should remember that I have come on this Earth because I love you immensely.</font>"<br>

<font color="red">"And what security of understanding. That everywhere in the whole world we have brothers and sisters who are on their Inner Being, on their Divine, and how we are bound together with that love.<br>
When I talk of love, people think that I am trying to make you weak people. Because people think those who l... love are weak. But the most dynamic power in this world is that of love. Is the most aggressive power, is that of love. Even we, when suffer in love, it is out of our strength that we suffer and not out of our weakness.</font><br>
......<br>
<font color="red">The Love that I am talking about, the Divine Love, makes you not only strong but dynamic. It is the Greatest Luminous Power that we can think of. Only when Love is surrounded by gross, and is lost in the gross, it looks as if it is weak and under chains. The time it is released, the Dynamic Power of Love can transcend all the evil powers of the world.</font><br>
......<br>
But it is not now for the realized to sit down and to wonder and laugh at the foolishness of the people who are not yet realized. Not even to take pity on them, but to come out. <font color="red">'Come out with the sword of love to win the whole world,' it is very, very essential.</font> If the creation has to be saved, then you are not to keep mum about it.<br>
