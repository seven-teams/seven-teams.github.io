"But how can one man fight the evils of this whole world? In the modern times when everything is moving very fast, it is very difficult for a single person to achieve anything without compromising with the trend of the world. Hence, it is absolutely essential that those artists who seek freedom and who believe that they have to play a vital role to further the cause of art, should give up their petty differences and jealousies and unite together. <font color="DarkRed">If such a group of artists decides to accept good in their personal, economic and social life and pledge not to deviate from the right path, then no power, however destructive, can lay hands on them.</font> Unity of purpose can only grant them all the security needed for the creation of their Art."<br>

As long as they are in Sahaja Yoga, we have to respect [them]. But they can be thrown away, they can get out of it.<br>
But unless and until this happens, do not put your ego on other people. Don't think that you understand everything. Don't think that you know everything.<br>
Respect each and every person. N... not to what he has read or for what he has learnt, but because he is a Great Soul."</font><br>

"<font color="DarkRed">I am thankful to you again and I just make one humble request that there is no need to have a pledge, as that is also a compulsion. There is no discipline in Sahaja Yoga.</font> It is understanding yourself, that you are born at a time that such a big transformation work has to take place, which is very subtle but is dynamic and so important and has to be done.<br>
May God bless you all and be more and more meditative and be aware of yourself.<br>
This is a tremendous work we have to do. It is the evolution of the highest type, we have to bring forth the changes and transformation of people. One Gorbachev is not sufficient. We need many of them and we are going to work it out."<br>

<b>Yogi Mahajan [reads aloud]:</b> <font color="DarkRed">We, the Sahaja Yogis of the world, do declare that we have experienced Self-realization through Sahaja (Spontaneous) awakening of the Kuṇḍalinī as discovered and taught by Śhrī Mātājī Nirmalā Devī. We do declare that these are the benefits we have experienced in our own lives and see in the lives of others who have had their Self-realization.<br>
Our life becomes one of purity and simplicity.<br>
Before marriage we lead a very chaste life. We don't even like to listen to talk of sex. Sex we enjoy only in a sanctified and legal marriage.<br>
We enjoy monogamous or monandrous marriage with a Sahaja Yoginī of our choice.<br>
Husband and wife respect each other. They understand each other fully. There is very deep love between husband and wife, but there is no public display of romance, as it upsets our modesty and privacy.<br>
Children are an important part of our married life. Most children of Sahaja Yogis are born realized. We love children, our own and those of others. We enjoy watching their growth and their play. We enjoy taking them on holidays. We are not possessive of our children, and do not smother them with our affection and prevent the development of their own personality. We want them to be strong and settled within themselves so that they do not become impressed by wrong ideas, wrong behavior or fall under the influence of wrong types of media and advertising.<br>
We do not spoil them by letting them dominate us with their demands. Children mostly like our correction, and sometimes they correct us as well. We like to teach them proper manners and respect for others, to share with others. We like them to be clean, tidy and properly dressed. We do not let them be cheeky or insolent.<br>
We like to send them to registered Sahaja Yoga Schools, if they want to go, where they will get a high standard of balanced education, where proper moral conduct is taught and encouraged, where they won't be abused or subjected to immoral and wrong behavior.<br>
We love to watch their aptitudes develop, to support the flourishing of their innate talents, and encourage them in other fields of development. We like them to understand us and all other Sahaja Yogis, as well as all the cultures of the world, artistic, musical, literary, religious free from prejudice. We like them to understand and enjoy the beauty of the world and the natural environment.<br>
We enjoy our new found knowledge that comes through wisdom and inspiration.<br>
When we mature we are no longer afraid of the horrible aggression of modem methods.<br>
We spontaneously enjoy all the arts, but only those works that are beautiful and soothing, that give joy: works that are traditional or classical, enduring works of great masters of art, music and literature and works that inspire and praise the Divine.<br>
We do not enjoy things that are not respectable, that are vulgar, jarring on the nerves.<br>
We love to read and understand all the Scriptures and find the true message in them which we can verify through our new found vibratory awareness.<br>
We are very normal and we keep the company of all others who are abnormal or subnormal.<br>
We do not give up our jobs or our work but we enjoy the company of all the Sahaja Yogis, whatever work they may do or whatever country they may come from.<br>
We enjoy this vast ocean of beautiful people. We are no longer only limited to the company of our colleagues, but have friends from ail over the world.<br>
We would love to write about and publish all the miracles that happen to us through Sahaja Yoga, and also the miraculous Photos that we get spontaneously. But Śhrī Mātājī will not permit us to do so, because of Her modesty. She says, "No one would believe they are real."<br>
We like to find out about the activities of the religions, cults and anti cult movements and why they are trying to mislead people away from the Truth and away from the Reality of the Divine. We like to speak openly about our findings, without fear because we know we are speaking the Truth.<br>
We travel to different cities and towns, to mix with people and find out why they are so unhappy in their life.<br>
We love to create our own works of art. We enjoy the new inspiration we get from within to produce these works.<br>
We also enjoy mastering new skills besides our innate ones and then to create some things that are uniquely spiritual.<br>
We enjoy our work, whatever it may be, and try to excel at it. So many Sahaja Yogis have reached high positions in their fields whether they be lawyers, judges, industrialists, ambassadors, bureaucrats, doctors, architects or artists. These achievements they have reached through balance and respect for those who work around them.<br>
There is no aggressive ambition in Sahaja Yogis, we do not try to outdo our colleagues so they are very relieved. We are promoted because of our talents, respectability and understanding and not because we are always hankering after someone or doing sycophancy to any boss.<br>
We love to keep our homes open to all kinds of families. We like our homes to be welcoming, to be clean and tidy. We like them to be decorated with artistic and handmade goods of a high quality. We like to use natural materials for our homes, our clothes and on our skins.<br>
We do not like manmade plastics, nylons, etc.<br>
We love to help each other and are concerned for the welfare and well-being of others. We enjoy our generosity. We enjoy feeding people and giving them presents.<br>
We eat any foods we like, or that are good for our well-being, without greed or denial. We don't eat large animals (cows, horses, etc.), or food cooked in alcohol. We don't take alcohol as it causes us to vomit. We are also so contented that we don't need to escape from reality using strong drink or drugs. We are so relaxed we don't need to smoke. This also causes us to vomit.<br>
We have no worries about money. All our needs are catered for.<br>
Śhrī Mātājī will not let us read the Guru Gītā as it says that the disciple should give all his money and everything to the guru. We would happily do this as thanks to Her for saving us from our own destruction, but She will not take a single paisā from us.<br>
We would love to give Her a garden of flowers, but She won't let us waste our money and says that, "One is sufficient." We all would love to give Her, individually, birthday presents, but She will only accept one present that is given collectively. If we do forcibly give Her an individual present, She gives us a bigger one in return, so we have stopped giving Her individual presents. She ps always insisting we should not even give Her collective presents.<br>
She has only now allowed us to pay for half of Her traveling expenses.<br>
Only now can we pay for our food and travel in India. Previously She paid for all of us who went to India.<br>
She has bought houses to use as our Āśhrams which until recently were rent-free. She has never stayed in these as without paying.<br>
Previously all books and tapes were sold without any royalty payments. Now Śhrī Mātājī has agreed to accept some, but so tar nothing has been sent.<br>
She always uses the money collected for the spreading of Sahaja Yoga.<br>
Houses which are in the name of some Sahaja Yoga leaders, were completely built by Sahaja Yogis but now they have taken their homes back.<br>
Although we cannot give any money for Self-realization, or to Śhrī Mātājī in person, we do not object to giving some money, in trust, for the spreading of the teaching of Sahaja Yoga. We do not know of any organization or group that does not collect money for some reason.<br>
In most countries Sahaja Yoga is registered as a charitable, nonprofit society. Any money that is collected is kept in a bank with proper accounts.<br>
Śhrī Mātājī is extremely trusting of all Sahaja Yogis, but same have taken advantage of Her confidence and taken large amounts of money from Her personally. These people were asked to leave Sahaja Yoga. They were not even made to repay the monies they took from Her. They were just forgiven.<br>
We only trust Śhrī Mātājī, who has a great sense of public money.<br>
Whenever anyone makes money out of Sahaja Yogis and is found out, they turn against Śhrī Mātājī, most of these people are pardoned by Śhrī Mātājī. They have mostly fallen under the influence of their half-baked wives who have mislead them into these corrupt practices.<br>
In the twenty-one years of Sahaja Yoga hardly a dozen people have been asked to leave.<br>
Apart from wrongfully collecting money, people were asked to leave for the following reasons: homosexuality, flirting and adultery, mental disease, aggression and domination of others, particularly towards women. These people were given all opportunities to improve their behavior before being asked to leave.<br>
Some of them have since overcome their problems and returned.<br>
Some of those that were asked to leave have turned against Sahaja Yoga, but they never say why they had to leave Sahaja Yoga. We do not discuss them or bother about them as they are like a rotten apple and we are glad to see them go. If they are lying it is their misfortune.<br>
We are happy that we are not so unfortunate as to come to Sahaja Yoga, see the Truth and still misbehave and be sent away.<br>
Thus Sahaja Yoga is a Mahā Yoga. Never before in the history of spirituality has such a mass awakening of Truth been seen. It expects a very high moral standard from its participants because these are the innate qualities of a spiritual person who wants to do spiritual work.<br>
We are not a moneymaking concern so we do not require great numbers of people. We are only interested in people of spiritual depth and quality.<br>
Our precepts must be expressed in our practices and our life. We cannot be hypocrites.<br>
There is no prejudice on the grounds of color, race, religion, creed or financial standing. The only criteria [criterion] is spiritual growth, which makes us feel joyous.<br>
If we do make any mistake we would like Śhrī Mātājī to punish us, as a Guru does, but She punishes us by forgiving us.<br>
Even if we want to feel guilty for our mistakes She will not allow us to feel that way on the grounds that we are only human beings and slowly we will all improver by facing our mistakes.<br>
Even though we would like Her to give us constant advice and guidance, She makes us become our own gurus, to become the masters of our own lives and spiritual ascent (to know thy Self).<br>
If we write to Her confessing our past lives and sins, She won't read our letters. Instead She always tells us to be in the present.<br>
A true Sahaja Yogi should not commit sins because of his spiritual nature. This is very easy for us as we develop a great sensitivity to sin.<br>
We believe in the unity of all religions, which we know as a fact through our vibratory awareness, are all from the One Source of God Almighty.<br>
We worship all the Incarnations and venerate all the Seers, Saints and realized Souls of the past and present. We enjoy all their writings, poetry and works of art. We have discovered many saintly people who were never recognized before as great, evolved souls.<br>
We are against fundamentalism and the ignorance of organized religion.<br>
We believe in the unity of One World and One God.<br>
We respect our wives and all women as the mothers of children.<br>
We enjoy our virtue, faith and sense of security.<br>
We enjoy our peace, calm and forthright attitudes.<br>
We enjoy our responsibility for the awakening of the spirituality in man: to work for the seekers of the world with love and patience; to see the light in their eyes when they feel the actualization of Kuṇḍalinī awakening; to see thousands of people of every nation experiencing Self-realization; to see Germans, Russians, Jews and Arabs live in harmony together.<br>
We enjoy the purity of relationships of men and women as brothers and sisters. Any person in an Āśhram or one of our groups who is found flirting or dating is asked to leave. Thus we have no family complications.<br>
We enjoy speaking pure, correct language which is clearly expressed. We enjoy keeping silent and letting others speak. We enjoy the speeches of other Sahaja Yogis, and they also enjoy ours.<br>
We enjoy the sweet, loving nature of other people but avoid arrogance and aggression.<br>
We abhor vulgar, obscene and scandalous talk and gossip.<br>
We enjoy the fragrances of the flowers and nature.<br>
We enjoy food that satisfies the body and not the tongue.<br>
We love to discuss God Almighty and His Compassion, and also His wrath for the people who are evil.<br>
Our ears love to hear words of wisdom and the praises of God, melodious music that soothes the mind. We love to sing songs in praise of the Divine in a proper language with correct pitch, harmony and rhythm.<br>
We enjoy the purity of non-adulterous eyes.<br>
We enjoy watching our ego and laughing at it.<br>
We try to remain in a state of thoughtless awareness because it is only in this state that we can grow spiritually, as we are in the present. The past is over and the future does not exist. Only the present is the reality.<br>
We do not rationalize our mistakes or our achievements. It is God who is doing the work, not us.<br>
We are just the witnesses of His drama.<br>
We are not disturbed by past conditioning or future ambitions.<br>
We enjoy expressing reality and Sahaja Yoga in words and deed.<br>
We enjoy our strength and wisdom and the freedom we have from vanity, greed, hatred, jealousy and violence.<br>
We try to analyze and find out through discussion why all the religions have failed, why the Scriptures have been mutilated and misrepresented.<br>
We want to find out why people give money for God when He has no understanding of money.<br>
We study the cults and anti-cult movements to see how they affect the subtle center of seekers and spoil their chances of ascent into higher awareness.<br>
Many new facts we learn can be verified scientifically.<br>
We put this knowledge into practical use for the betterment of society.<br>
We have become aware, alert, wise, dynamic, relaxed and above all, enlightened.<br>
We enjoy the achievements of our young people and how they are saved from the corruption and immorality that abounds in today's society; how they are transformed from a lethargic and depressive life into a new dynamic, youthful life. We enjoy their amazing meteoric progress in their sports, art and music and in their scholarly capacity through their ascent.<br>
We enjoy knowing Śhrī Mātājī as our Mother.<br>
We enjoy the example She sets for an ideal life. She never demands. She is self-content and self-contained. Loving, can gently solving any problems we may have, always paying attention to our lives, She knows all of us and all the good things about us. She is the ideal housewife and mother, caring for all Her relations.<br>
We enjoy listening to Her husband speaking of Her many qualities as a wife and mother: how he describes Her capacity to do many things at the same time without any effort; how She has the love and respect of all the staff and officers of his work whatever office he has held; how even they coiled Her, "Mother."<br>
Through Her own example She has shown us how to live as good householders, and has saved many marriages through this example.<br>
She will not permit us to escape our social responsibilities by taking saṃnyāsa or turning away from society -- no matter how decadent it may be.<br>
Although She has so much power, She has never used it to manipulate anyone. On the contrary, She is so trusting that we fear She will become the victim of manipulation. But we have learnt that She cannot be tricked or manipulated.<br>
We enjoy the knowledge She has in every subject, except money and banking. All Her accounts and checkbooks are kept by Sahaja Yogis. They write for Her and She just signs.<br>
Her knowledge is very, very deep as well as wide on the subtlest of subtle subjects. She explains these in simple words.<br>
She never has to read anything but has a knowledge of English, French and Spanish literature.<br>
She knows many languages, especially Indian. Her mother tongue is Marathi. She never studied English, Hindi or Sanskrit languages at school because She was a medical student, but Her mastery over these languages is admirable.<br>
She has never studied psychology but She was invited lo speak on Jungian Psychology at the Jungian Society in New York.<br>
We enjoy giving Realization and curing people without using our egos.<br>
We enjoy our enlightened attention. Our attention sees the good points of others, and doesn't go to violence and aggression. It works quietly and keeps quiet.<br>
We are gifted with a new dimension in our awareness of Collective Consciousness. It can penetrate into any area of the subtle center of any human being and we know the problems as well as how to solve them. It also gives us knowledge of ourselves, judges us and cures us, it fills us with sell-confidence and humility.<br>
Our attention can go to the problems in the home, of our family and friends, of our country and the world, and it can go to international situations. Wherever we put it, it can work things out by offering solutions to bring freedom, prosperity and peace.<br>
Sahaja Yogis from all over the world enjoy communicating with each other about solving social, political and economic problems through their enlightened collective attention.<br>
Our attention goes to divine beauty, which is soothing and elevating and enjoys the best of all the world's cultures.<br>
We enjoy the love and compassion and innate virtues enlightened by Sahaja Yoga.<br>
We can laugh at our own faults and enjoy the good points of others.<br>
We enjoy knowing the Absolute Truth and absolute answers through vibratory awareness, free from doubts.<br>
We enjoy looking after the needy, especially children and our elders, through our vibratory awareness -- to diagnose diseases and cure the sick and the incurable.<br>
We do not ridicule the weak, but try to uplift them to our level of strength, power and dynamism through our loving attention.<br>
We enjoy the comfort of our Spirit and are not attached to the comforts of our body and mind as we are no longer the body, mind, conditioning or ego but the Spirit.<br>
We enjoy our knowledge like a cook enjoys a good meal he has cooked and we enjoy sharing it with others.<br>
We enjoy the Joy which has no duality of happiness and unhappiness, which only can be enjoyed after Self-realization has matured.<br>
We enjoy the hurdles created by our enemies because they challenge us to rise higher. Every disadvantage becomes an advantage. We enjoy blind and stupid opposition as a joke. We leave the aggressive and cruel in the hands of the Divine.<br>
We wish all the arrogant, scandalous liars to be prosecuted, testing the validity of the laws in the name of God and also the laws of all the lands.<br>
We enjoy the great task of the emancipation of humanity put on our shoulders.<br>
We enjoy rectifying all the horrible mistakes of the greedy, selfish, aggressive and cruel people, individually or collectively.<br>
We enjoy our powers because we never feel powerless as this is the Power of Divine by which is ever growing.<br>
This is how we enjoy the real spiritual life of the Kingdom of God.</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">So then, everybody should, today, decide and take an oath, that, 'We'll do everything to spread Sahaja Yoga with humility.'</font> "<br>

<b>Version 1:</b><br>
"<font color="DarkRed">So today, we have to pledge that, 'We forgive everyone towards whoever we have grudge or anger.'</font><br>
I agree that there are many such crimes that harms us deeply and we are unable to save ourselves from it. But if you are devotee of Śhivjī, then you will be surprised that you will not find any crime so big that your heart is bigger that Śhivjī. That's why He will realize it [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] and so don't insult anyone.<br>
To show someone down is wrong. Who are we to insult others?"<br>
