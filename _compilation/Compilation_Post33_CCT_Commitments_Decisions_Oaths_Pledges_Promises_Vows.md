"But how can one man fight the evils of this whole world? In the modern times when everything is moving very fast, it is very difficult for a single person to achieve anything without compromising with the trend of the world. Hence, it is absolutely essential that those artists who seek freedom and who believe that they have to play a vital role to further the cause of art, should give up their petty differences and jealousies and unite together. <font color="DarkRed">If such a group of artists decides to accept good in their personal, economic and social life and pledge not to deviate from the right path, then no power, however destructive, can lay hands on them.</font> Unity of purpose can only grant them all the security needed for the creation of their Art."<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today I want certain promises by you to be reached. And the foremost of all, as Christ has said, "Love thy neighbor as thyself." I would say, one step ahead of that: "Love thy neighbor, a Sahaja Yogi, more than yourself." Let us start here. We, I don't ask you to open the whole universe: among you[rselves].<br>
First of all, decide: what have you done for others?<br>
Second: [a] promise you have to make that you will never say a harsh word to any other Sahaja Yogi, even if he beats you hollow. You can tell Me about it. That is the greatest sin you will be committing from today.<br>
......<br>
Tonight, you promise Me that you will look at every Sahaja Yogi as a person in bondage in love and not in hatred.<br>
......<br>
Today, you must promise Me that you will meditate. You can introspect [rather] than getting into your ego.<br>
Thirdly, you will not criticize Sahaj Yog, that is God's own methods, at any cost! If you do not understand a part of Sahaj Yog, you can come and ask Me, but don't criticize. This is you must promise Me."</font><br>

"So, that Anna Mahārāj had come somewhere so I said that, "If he is seen somewhere call Me also." He was told that, "Mātājī is coming."<br>
I went. He was smoking a cigarette in front of Me and was talking in his Hyderabadi language something with these four or five women. Very comfortably he is [was] sitting. I went. I said, "How are you?" He said, "My gurujī left his throne to meet You in Bombay [Mumbai]." I said, "Why not? After all, I'm his Mother and he came to meet Me. Do you have any objection?" He said, "He should not have done that. He is this and he is that. He is gone case and so forth." I said, "Now see My way. He just broke your legs." So, I put kumkum to him and then as I was leaving I asked him to put kumkum to My forehead. Just as he put on My Āgñyā chakra I just pulled him inside. He just started shaking, "Mother, Mother, save me! Leave me!" <font color="DarkRed">I said, "First you tell Me that you will not criticize your guru." "No, I will not criticize my guru. Leave me!" "And secondly, you drop your habit of smoking." "Yes. Leave me! Leave me!" I said, "Thirdly you should leave the company of women and go and sit in a jungle." When he promised all three things only then I left his hands. Else he was almost fully sucked and he couldn't move his fingers from there.</font><br>
That drama was seen by all of them for a whole five minutes.<br>
Then he left that place and now sits in jungles. But he still did his old ways.<br>
Then I came to know that he was asking people to give him gold rings, of one and a quarter tolā [about 14.58 grams] and promised people that their problems will be over.<br>
"Mahārāj, this is too much." "OK, you give whatever you can. If you cannot give a one and a quarter tolā, just give half a tolā. Whatever you can manage." He collected thousands of tolās of gold like this.<br>
By God's blessing, he had a theft at his place and all his gold was stolen.<br>
So, he said, "This is Mother's work." I said, "Mine? But I did not get that gold‽"<br>
Then what do you do? If you cannot get the work done simply then you have to turn to diplomacy."<br>

"Now we have got, astrologically there are three and a half auspicious days where you don't have to consultant any uh ... any books of astrology, which are called as Pañchāṅg, to find out whether it is an auspicious time or not. For any Pūjā, for any [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] good work you have to do, people consultant, in India, the Pañchāṅg, is the book to find out which date is auspicious [and] which is not.<br>
One of them is today. Is a day you can do anything good, you decide anything good. <font color="DarkRed">Today is the day to take an oath, to think of something great, to visualize something big, to ask a boon, to do a big Pūjā, is one of the greatest uh day.</font> One of the, we call them muhūrtas, which where you do not consultant these books.<br>

<font color="DarkRed">'So I am going to be one of them. And we are going to enlighten the path of the people who want to have Self-realization.'<br>
All these great ideas come to us when we touch our depths. And we feel responsible for all the rest of the humanity.</font><br> 
But then we gradually realize that there are lots of problems with our us ... own being, and the Kuṇḍalinī goes back into it, comes up again, and you realize that you have to correct yourself quite a lot.<br>
Then this correction portion starts. You start thinking about yourself more than about others. And also other things which were identified with us like our own personal problems, our own personal ideas, ambitions, professions and all the things that, with which we have been enamored so far start peeping into our minds. <font color="DarkRed">And we start forgetting that moment when we got our Realization and all that we promised within ourselves to do.</font><br>
<font color="DarkRed">So, the New [Year] Day comes to remind you: 'Doesn't matter, whatever has happened has happened, is finished. Today a new day has come to you again for you to promise again. Again start your journey, know the sun has come. And now be refreshed, the newness bring[s] the freshness of life.' And then you again start, greater enthusiasm on the New [Year] Day, with new ideas, with new promises, with new vows and with greater understanding about Sahaj Yog.</font>"<br>"

<font color="DarkRed">"We are not here to gain everything out of Sahaja Yoga. Like, in the beginning people have problems about their families. So they think that God should solve the problem because they have come to Sahaja Yoga to oblige Sahaja Yoga now, so God must solve their problems. Now they have problems of their jobs, God must solve the problem! If there're problems with their relations, God must solve the problems. That's the sort of a job given to God, because they have very graciously joined Sahaja Yoga. Then, after that God must give them money. He must provide them for everything and He must look after them. For no commitment at all: there's no commitment. Nobody has any commitment in Sahaja Yoga. But, 'God is committed and God has to work it out.' Then they start, some people, foolishly start using Sahaja Yoga for other purposes, like earning money or earning power, or name or fame or domination or anything.<br>
These are the steps which are going down, not upwards. And then, once you go down, you don't realize whether you are going upward or downward.<br>
So, in dedication one has to see: :What have I dedicated for Sahaja Yog? All the time I have problems, all the time I say, 'I can't do this because of that. I can't do that because of this. This is the problem. This I would like to do, this I would like to do,' all the time there's an 'I, I, I and I.' But what have I dedicated? What time have I given to Sahaja Yoga? How much money have I given to Sahaja Yoga? Nothing at all!"<br>
People don't even take leave for Sahaj Yog. They can't do anything for this!<br>
These people not only took leave but permanently went and settled in that place, in that far-fetched place. Without any machinery, without anything, they did that whole painting and the whole uh excavation and all that uh, what you call, the entire work of such a tremendous volume that is impossible in these modern times.<br>
Nobody can recreate something like that, with all your machinery, with everything, because people don't have dedication.<br>
So for Sahaja Yoga, we have to put ourselves onto a point: 'What did I do, what did I sacrifice for Sahaja Yoga? Nothing! Is only for my own child, or maybe for my wife, or for myself, or for my job, or for something.' What is our commitment?<br>
And without commitment purity cannot come in. Will go up and down like a yo-yo.<br>
We are committed to Sahaja Yoga! If there are even five people who are really, fully committed to Sahaja Yoga, it can be built up that way.<br>
But the problem is: everybody shares with each other this kind of noncommittal behavior. And that's something not good.<br>
Committed means-s: even if we have to give our life we should do it. Even if we have to give up everything we should do it.<br>
But all other considerations are to be taken there, everything should work out, it's all should be joy all the time, must get your jobs, must get your wives, must get your everything, children properly done, everything to be done by Sahaja Yoga.<br>
And when this commitment will start, I'm sure Sahaja Yoga will spread like anything.<br>
Even falsehood, when people are committed! Like you see in all other religions: every religion they did that. And how much it has spread!<br>
Of course, Sahaja Yoga is blessings, is blissful, it blesses you all the time. It gives you a very long rope to hang you also sometimes, one must know: there's a blessing of that kind also.<br>
So one has to be very-very alert that God has chosen us for such a very special work and we have to be fully committed to Sahaja Yoga. All those who are wise will take to this and understand that the life is only worth this. Otherwise it's useless, is good for nothing, it has no meaning. And this has to come from, first from the leaders and then from others: complete commitment to Sahaja Yoga.<br>
It doesn't mean that you to give up anything. For My sake you don't have to do anything. But for your own sake, for your own betterment, you have to do it.<br>
I hope next time when you come to India you will be coming better prepared for commitments.<br>
Is not only money, is not only uh your talking about, your saying about it, writing about it, but it is through your own being it should have happen. You all should become the source of energy that, 'I want to emit all over the world that light which is going to enlighten.' No amount of artificially is going to work it out, but complete genuineniss [genuineness] within you.<br>
Look at these Saints! They had nobody, they had ... didn't have Mother to help them.<br>
This uh Gyāneśhwara's life if you read, you will be shocked! He didn't have even shoes to walk. He was treated so's badly because His father was a saṃnyāsī and was married, so they said that, "He, These are the children of a saṃnyāsī!" They had no food to eat, They had to walk for miles together barefeet [barefoot].<br>
They had no blessings of the Mother on them. Despite [of] that, they kept to Sahaj Yog, they kept to their blessings of being one with God. Because They achieved that state.<br>
Now, all this is for your good, for your benevolence that you get all the blessings. But that doesn't mean that you should stagnate, that you should not progress. One has to progress higher and higher. One has to decide the commitment: 'I have committed to Sahaja Yoga.' And that is what you have to be committed [to].<br>
May God bless you all!"</font><br>

<b>Yogi Mahajan [reads aloud]:</b> <font color="DarkRed">We, the Sahaja Yogis of the world, do declare that we have experienced Self-realization through Sahaja (Spontaneous) awakening of the Kuṇḍalinī as discovered and taught by Śhrī Mātājī Nirmalā Devī. We do declare that these are the benefits we have experienced in our own lives and see in the lives of others who have had their Self-realization.<br>
Our life becomes one of purity and simplicity.<br>
Before marriage we lead a very chaste life. We don't even like to listen to talk of sex. Sex we enjoy only in a sanctified and legal marriage.<br>
We enjoy monogamous or monandrous marriage with a Sahaja Yoginī of our choice.<br>
Husband and wife respect each other. They understand each other fully. There is very deep love between husband and wife, but there is no public display of romance, as it upsets our modesty and privacy.<br>
Children are an important part of our married life. Most children of Sahaja Yogis are born realized. We love children, our own and those of others. We enjoy watching their growth and their play. We enjoy taking them on holidays. We are not possessive of our children, and do not smother them with our affection and prevent the development of their own personality. We want them to be strong and settled within themselves so that they do not become impressed by wrong ideas, wrong behavior or fall under the influence of wrong types of media and advertising.<br>
We do not spoil them by letting them dominate us with their demands. Children mostly like our correction, and sometimes they correct us as well. We like to teach them proper manners and respect for others, to share with others. We like them to be clean, tidy and properly dressed. We do not let them be cheeky or insolent.<br>
We like to send them to registered Sahaja Yoga Schools, if they want to go, where they will get a high standard of balanced education, where proper moral conduct is taught and encouraged, where they won't be abused or subjected to immoral and wrong behavior.<br>
We love to watch their aptitudes develop, to support the flourishing of their innate talents, and encourage them in other fields of development. We like them to understand us and all other Sahaja Yogis, as well as all the cultures of the world, artistic, musical, literary, religious free from prejudice. We like them to understand and enjoy the beauty of the world and the natural environment.<br>
We enjoy our new found knowledge that comes through wisdom and inspiration.<br>
When we mature we are no longer afraid of the horrible aggression of modem methods.<br>
We spontaneously enjoy all the arts, but only those works that are beautiful and soothing, that give joy: works that are traditional or classical, enduring works of great masters of art, music and literature and works that inspire and praise the Divine.<br>
We do not enjoy things that are not respectable, that are vulgar, jarring on the nerves.<br>
We love to read and understand all the Scriptures and find the true message in them which we can verify through our new found vibratory awareness.<br>
We are very normal and we keep the company of all others who are abnormal or subnormal.<br>
We do not give up our jobs or our work but we enjoy the company of all the Sahaja Yogis, whatever work they may do or whatever country they may come from.<br>
We enjoy this vast ocean of beautiful people. We are no longer only limited to the company of our colleagues, but have friends from ail over the world.<br>
We would love to write about and publish all the miracles that happen to us through Sahaja Yoga, and also the miraculous Photos that we get spontaneously. But Śhrī Mātājī will not permit us to do so, because of Her modesty. She says, "No one would believe they are real."<br>
We like to find out about the activities of the religions, cults and anti cult movements and why they are trying to mislead people away from the Truth and away from the Reality of the Divine. We like to speak openly about our findings, without fear because we know we are speaking the Truth.<br>
We travel to different cities and towns, to mix with people and find out why they are so unhappy in their life.<br>
We love to create our own works of art. We enjoy the new inspiration we get from within to produce these works.<br>
We also enjoy mastering new skills besides our innate ones and then to create some things that are uniquely spiritual.<br>
We enjoy our work, whatever it may be, and try to excel at it. So many Sahaja Yogis have reached high positions in their fields whether they be lawyers, judges, industrialists, ambassadors, bureaucrats, doctors, architects or artists. These achievements they have reached through balance and respect for those who work around them.<br>
There is no aggressive ambition in Sahaja Yogis, we do not try to outdo our colleagues so they are very relieved. We are promoted because of our talents, respectability and understanding and not because we are always hankering after someone or doing sycophancy to any boss.<br>
We love to keep our homes open to all kinds of families. We like our homes to be welcoming, to be clean and tidy. We like them to be decorated with artistic and handmade goods of a high quality. We like to use natural materials for our homes, our clothes and on our skins.<br>
We do not like manmade plastics, nylons, etc.<br>
We love to help each other and are concerned for the welfare and well-being of others. We enjoy our generosity. We enjoy feeding people and giving them presents.<br>
We eat any foods we like, or that are good for our well-being, without greed or denial. We don't eat large animals (cows, horses, etc.), or food cooked in alcohol. We don't take alcohol as it causes us to vomit. We are also so contented that we don't need to escape from reality using strong drink or drugs. We are so relaxed we don't need to smoke. This also causes us to vomit.<br>
We have no worries about money. All our needs are catered for.<br>
Śhrī Mātājī will not let us read the Guru Gītā as it says that the disciple should give all his money and everything to the guru. We would happily do this as thanks to Her for saving us from our own destruction, but She will not take a single paisā from us.<br>
We would love to give Her a garden of flowers, but She won't let us waste our money and says that, "One is sufficient." We all would love to give Her, individually, birthday presents, but She will only accept one present that is given collectively. If we do forcibly give Her an individual present, She gives us a bigger one in return, so we have stopped giving Her individual presents. She ps always insisting we should not even give Her collective presents.<br>
She has only now allowed us to pay for half of Her traveling expenses.<br>
Only now can we pay for our food and travel in India. Previously She paid for all of us who went to India.<br>
She has bought houses to use as our Āśhrams which until recently were rent-free. She has never stayed in these as without paying.<br>
Previously all books and tapes were sold without any royalty payments. Now Śhrī Mātājī has agreed to accept some, but so tar nothing has been sent.<br>
She always uses the money collected for the spreading of Sahaja Yoga.<br>
Houses which are in the name of some Sahaja Yoga leaders, were completely built by Sahaja Yogis but now they have taken their homes back.<br>
Although we cannot give any money for Self-realization, or to Śhrī Mātājī in person, we do not object to giving some money, in trust, for the spreading of the teaching of Sahaja Yoga. We do not know of any organization or group that does not collect money for some reason.<br>
In most countries Sahaja Yoga is registered as a charitable, nonprofit society. Any money that is collected is kept in a bank with proper accounts.<br>
Śhrī Mātājī is extremely trusting of all Sahaja Yogis, but same have taken advantage of Her confidence and taken large amounts of money from Her personally. These people were asked to leave Sahaja Yoga. They were not even made to repay the monies they took from Her. They were just forgiven.<br>
We only trust Śhrī Mātājī, who has a great sense of public money.<br>
Whenever anyone makes money out of Sahaja Yogis and is found out, they turn against Śhrī Mātājī, most of these people are pardoned by Śhrī Mātājī. They have mostly fallen under the influence of their half-baked wives who have mislead them into these corrupt practices.<br>
In the twenty-one years of Sahaja Yoga hardly a dozen people have been asked to leave.<br>
Apart from wrongfully collecting money, people were asked to leave for the following reasons: homosexuality, flirting and adultery, mental disease, aggression and domination of others, particularly towards women. These people were given all opportunities to improve their behavior before being asked to leave.<br>
Some of them have since overcome their problems and returned.<br>
Some of those that were asked to leave have turned against Sahaja Yoga, but they never say why they had to leave Sahaja Yoga. We do not discuss them or bother about them as they are like a rotten apple and we are glad to see them go. If they are lying it is their misfortune.<br>
We are happy that we are not so unfortunate as to come to Sahaja Yoga, see the Truth and still misbehave and be sent away.<br>
Thus Sahaja Yoga is a Mahā Yoga. Never before in the history of spirituality has such a mass awakening of Truth been seen. It expects a very high moral standard from its participants because these are the innate qualities of a spiritual person who wants to do spiritual work.<br>
We are not a moneymaking concern so we do not require great numbers of people. We are only interested in people of spiritual depth and quality.<br>
Our precepts must be expressed in our practices and our life. We cannot be hypocrites.<br>
There is no prejudice on the grounds of color, race, religion, creed or financial standing. The only criteria [criterion] is spiritual growth, which makes us feel joyous.<br>
If we do make any mistake we would like Śhrī Mātājī to punish us, as a Guru does, but She punishes us by forgiving us.<br>
Even if we want to feel guilty for our mistakes She will not allow us to feel that way on the grounds that we are only human beings and slowly we will all improver by facing our mistakes.<br>
Even though we would like Her to give us constant advice and guidance, She makes us become our own gurus, to become the masters of our own lives and spiritual ascent (to know thy Self).<br>
If we write to Her confessing our past lives and sins, She won't read our letters. Instead She always tells us to be in the present.<br>
A true Sahaja Yogi should not commit sins because of his spiritual nature. This is very easy for us as we develop a great sensitivity to sin.<br>
We believe in the unity of all religions, which we know as a fact through our vibratory awareness, are all from the One Source of God Almighty.<br>
We worship all the Incarnations and venerate all the Seers, Saints and realized Souls of the past and present. We enjoy all their writings, poetry and works of art. We have discovered many saintly people who were never recognized before as great, evolved souls.<br>
We are against fundamentalism and the ignorance of organized religion.<br>
We believe in the unity of One World and One God.<br>
We respect our wives and all women as the mothers of children.<br>
We enjoy our virtue, faith and sense of security.<br>
We enjoy our peace, calm and forthright attitudes.<br>
We enjoy our responsibility for the awakening of the spirituality in man: to work for the seekers of the world with love and patience; to see the light in their eyes when they feel the actualization of Kuṇḍalinī awakening; to see thousands of people of every nation experiencing Self-realization; to see Germans, Russians, Jews and Arabs live in harmony together.<br>
We enjoy the purity of relationships of men and women as brothers and sisters. Any person in an Āśhram or one of our groups who is found flirting or dating is asked to leave. Thus we have no family complications.<br>
We enjoy speaking pure, correct language which is clearly expressed. We enjoy keeping silent and letting others speak. We enjoy the speeches of other Sahaja Yogis, and they also enjoy ours.<br>
We enjoy the sweet, loving nature of other people but avoid arrogance and aggression.<br>
We abhor vulgar, obscene and scandalous talk and gossip.<br>
We enjoy the fragrances of the flowers and nature.<br>
We enjoy food that satisfies the body and not the tongue.<br>
We love to discuss God Almighty and His Compassion, and also His wrath for the people who are evil.<br>
Our ears love to hear words of wisdom and the praises of God, melodious music that soothes the mind. We love to sing songs in praise of the Divine in a proper language with correct pitch, harmony and rhythm.<br>
We enjoy the purity of non-adulterous eyes.<br>
We enjoy watching our ego and laughing at it.<br>
We try to remain in a state of thoughtless awareness because it is only in this state that we can grow spiritually, as we are in the present. The past is over and the future does not exist. Only the present is the reality.<br>
We do not rationalize our mistakes or our achievements. It is God who is doing the work, not us.<br>
We are just the witnesses of His drama.<br>
We are not disturbed by past conditioning or future ambitions.<br>
We enjoy expressing reality and Sahaja Yoga in words and deed.<br>
We enjoy our strength and wisdom and the freedom we have from vanity, greed, hatred, jealousy and violence.<br>
We try to analyze and find out through discussion why all the religions have failed, why the Scriptures have been mutilated and misrepresented.<br>
We want to find out why people give money for God when He has no understanding of money.<br>
We study the cults and anti-cult movements to see how they affect the subtle center of seekers and spoil their chances of ascent into higher awareness.<br>
Many new facts we learn can be verified scientifically.<br>
We put this knowledge into practical use for the betterment of society.<br>
We have become aware, alert, wise, dynamic, relaxed and above all, enlightened.<br>
We enjoy the achievements of our young people and how they are saved from the corruption and immorality that abounds in today's society; how they are transformed from a lethargic and depressive life into a new dynamic, youthful life. We enjoy their amazing meteoric progress in their sports, art and music and in their scholarly capacity through their ascent.<br>
We enjoy knowing Śhrī Mātājī as our Mother.<br>
We enjoy the example She sets for an ideal life. She never demands. She is self-content and self-contained. Loving, can gently solving any problems we may have, always paying attention to our lives, She knows all of us and all the good things about us. She is the ideal housewife and mother, caring for all Her relations.<br>
We enjoy listening to Her husband speaking of Her many qualities as a wife and mother: how he describes Her capacity to do many things at the same time without any effort; how She has the love and respect of all the staff and officers of his work whatever office he has held; how even they coiled Her, "Mother."<br>
Through Her own example She has shown us how to live as good householders, and has saved many marriages through this example.<br>
She will not permit us to escape our social responsibilities by taking saṃnyāsa or turning away from society -- no matter how decadent it may be.<br>
Although She has so much power, She has never used it to manipulate anyone. On the contrary, She is so trusting that we fear She will become the victim of manipulation. But we have learnt that She cannot be tricked or manipulated.<br>
We enjoy the knowledge She has in every subject, except money and banking. All Her accounts and checkbooks are kept by Sahaja Yogis. They write for Her and She just signs.<br>
Her knowledge is very, very deep as well as wide on the subtlest of subtle subjects. She explains these in simple words.<br>
She never has to read anything but has a knowledge of English, French and Spanish literature.<br>
She knows many languages, especially Indian. Her mother tongue is Marathi. She never studied English, Hindi or Sanskrit languages at school because She was a medical student, but Her mastery over these languages is admirable.<br>
She has never studied psychology but She was invited lo speak on Jungian Psychology at the Jungian Society in New York.<br>
We enjoy giving Realization and curing people without using our egos.<br>
We enjoy our enlightened attention. Our attention sees the good points of others, and doesn't go to violence and aggression. It works quietly and keeps quiet.<br>
We are gifted with a new dimension in our awareness of Collective Consciousness. It can penetrate into any area of the subtle center of any human being and we know the problems as well as how to solve them. It also gives us knowledge of ourselves, judges us and cures us, it fills us with sell-confidence and humility.<br>
Our attention can go to the problems in the home, of our family and friends, of our country and the world, and it can go to international situations. Wherever we put it, it can work things out by offering solutions to bring freedom, prosperity and peace.<br>
Sahaja Yogis from all over the world enjoy communicating with each other about solving social, political and economic problems through their enlightened collective attention.<br>
Our attention goes to divine beauty, which is soothing and elevating and enjoys the best of all the world's cultures.<br>
We enjoy the love and compassion and innate virtues enlightened by Sahaja Yoga.<br>
We can laugh at our own faults and enjoy the good points of others.<br>
We enjoy knowing the Absolute Truth and absolute answers through vibratory awareness, free from doubts.<br>
We enjoy looking after the needy, especially children and our elders, through our vibratory awareness -- to diagnose diseases and cure the sick and the incurable.<br>
We do not ridicule the weak, but try to uplift them to our level of strength, power and dynamism through our loving attention.<br>
We enjoy the comfort of our Spirit and are not attached to the comforts of our body and mind as we are no longer the body, mind, conditioning or ego but the Spirit.<br>
We enjoy our knowledge like a cook enjoys a good meal he has cooked and we enjoy sharing it with others.<br>
We enjoy the Joy which has no duality of happiness and unhappiness, which only can be enjoyed after Self-realization has matured.<br>
We enjoy the hurdles created by our enemies because they challenge us to rise higher. Every disadvantage becomes an advantage. We enjoy blind and stupid opposition as a joke. We leave the aggressive and cruel in the hands of the Divine.<br>
We wish all the arrogant, scandalous liars to be prosecuted, testing the validity of the laws in the name of God and also the laws of all the lands.<br>
We enjoy the great task of the emancipation of humanity put on our shoulders.<br>
We enjoy rectifying all the horrible mistakes of the greedy, selfish, aggressive and cruel people, individually or collectively.<br>
We enjoy our powers because we never feel powerless as this is the Power of Divine by which is ever growing.<br>
This is how we enjoy the real spiritual life of the Kingdom of God.</font><br>

I agree that there are many such crimes that harms us deeply and we are unable to save ourselves from it.
