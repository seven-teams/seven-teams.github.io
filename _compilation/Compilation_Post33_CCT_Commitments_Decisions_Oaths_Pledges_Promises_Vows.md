<font color="DarkRed">"But still I am satisfied because within you there are some enamored souls (śhaukīn jīv). They realize what they have got after many births, so they are holding tight to Sahaja Yoga and are enjoying the taste of love. They are swimming in bliss. They don't have a feeling of separation or sadness: they have become a poem. There are several flowers like this too.<br>
Sometimes you hurt and trample over these two flowers. Are these the signs of a Yogi?<br>
You should take a vow today, introspect your own shortcomings and be surrendered, speak and love everything from your heart. The mind that highlights the shortcomings [faults] of others, that horse is moving in the opposite direction, by straightening its path must be conquered (mārg akramit kelā pāhije).<br>
I have dedicated My life for you and all My puṇya is at your disposal for the betterment [upliftment] of you. But you should also gather some puṇya on your own, isn't it?<br>
You are the light lamps of the entire world. You are brothers and sisters amongst yourself so be one, be submerged and be awakened."</font><br>

"But how can one man fight the evils of this whole world? In the modern times when everything is moving very fast, it is very difficult for a single person to achieve anything without compromising with the trend of the world. Hence, it is absolutely essential that those artists who seek freedom and who believe that they have to play a vital role to further the cause of art, should give up their petty differences and jealousies and unite together. <font color="DarkRed">If such a group of artists decides to accept good in their personal, economic and social life and pledge not to deviate from the right path, then no power, however destructive, can lay hands on them.</font> Unity of purpose can only grant them all the security needed for the creation of their Art."<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Joy is not outside. It is within. It is within you. People say you are in the form of God.<br>
Just by talking about it, it is not going to happen. In Marathi they say, "Bolāchāch bhāta bōlāchīch kaḍhī" [Only making promises but not fulfilling them].<br>
Whether I say that you seek the Formless or Formed, but these are only words.<br>
Thousands of discussions have been done, crores of books have been written, how many lives were destroyed, but there is no end to a man's thinking.<br> 
......<br>
This is not of a question of being hopeful but a question of time. The time will come. The time of Kali Yuga is a time of a very terrific battle. It is a time of total darkness. You don't know this as you are seeing Me.<br>
Besides yourself you are not being able to see anything else, but those who are realized know that what a pledge has been tied.<br>
Negativity and positive forces are both tying their force. There is the full force of sympathetic and parasympathetic. The sympathetic is sucking away the parasympathetic. But no matter how much the sympathetic sucks it out, if that parasympathetic becomes one with that Ānanda then this will go on filling it up. You can go on using up the petrol but if that petrol is connected to the petrol pump and what is there to be afraid of. This is all due to the sympathetic. The active consciousness side of the sympathetic, from where you do all your work, from where you spend your energy, if that is over spent then a disease like cancer sets in. And if the superego is over used then madness comes in.<br>
I do not cure people's diseases. To say that I cure people's diseases is a wrong concept. Because the parasympathetic system cools down the sympathetic system by which a person gets cured. If there is some madness then that too will get cured. And if within you a disease like cancer sets in, due to overactivity that too will get cured.<br>
The cure for cancer is only Sahaja Yoga and there is no other cure in the world for it. This point will be proved. I know that this will be proved with time that many have been cured of cancer. The people who are sitting here can also tell you."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Now, he's a husband, he thinks, 'She's my wife.' Meaning, 'I have a special relationship with her. There must be some connection from past lives. There must be some connection from previous births. So until my wife doesn't accept this thing, how can I accept it?' He saves money, even if he runs after another woman, there's no problem, that's OK! If he spends his money on another woman, there's no problem in that either. And he can do whatever he wants.<br>
But when Sahaja Yoga comes, he becomes more committed to his wife, I have seen this. Because Sahaja Yoga teaches you love. So, because of teaching love, he becomes compassionate towards his wife. And he starts thinking about his wife too. And the wife, on the other hand, teaches him a lesson."</font><br>

Śharayū [Gaḍakarī] is also an amazing girl. I am not sure what shall I say to you all. Forgive me if you felt insulted at my house. But how come I troubled you this much, I am unable to understand. Even sākṣhāt Chaṇḍikā would not have done anything this bad. Sometimes I feel so bad that I have troubled My loving daughters so much. Only I get appreciated as a Mother, but who will look after you people? Until the last moment you all were peacefully busy with the work. I couldn't find even a little bit of time to hug you and ask you about your well-being. We found the land which is a gift from you all to Sahaja Yoga. No matter how skilled the captain is, the boat should be strong. In this work we witnessed the power of the Virāṭa. From this one can conclude that if Sahaja Yogis decide to do something, nothing is impossible. "</font><br>

<b>Version 1:</b><br>
"The one who has to achieve, the one who has to get should individually come, not as a group, individually. And when individually you will get inside it, then you will become like a drop when becomes [the] ocean.<br>
Otherwise you will carry the dirt of everyone along with you.<br>
You must decide that, 'Except Sahaja Yoga I will not talk anything else with anyone, no discussions, arguments, etc.'<br>
You are so many! I never got so many people in any Incarnation as many as you all are. So many!<br>
And with their help the boat will go across.<br>
So, it's My prayer and request to you, that if really I have loved you and have given love to you, then when the fruit is to come then you won't have to do any stupidity, of any kind. You must get maturity. Don't act childish.<br>
And those who talk childish, you must say, 'Keep quiet,' and don't listen to them.<br>
Talk like matured elders. You have become matured fruits. Be silent within and enjoy!<br>
Break all illusions and differences and the blood of life will start flowing within you and will fill you with joy, peace and bliss!"<br>

<b>Version 2:</b><br>
"Now one drop becomes an ocean. If you don't come that way, then you will carry everyone's dirt or problems.<br>
In that there is no discussion, talk. 'I will not talk other than Sahaja Yoga.' That you decide.<br>
You all are very much in a big group. I did not get so many people in any lifetime. As you are in a big number, with your help Boat will be sailed.<br>
So I have a request: 'If I have loved you, then there should be no mistake in time to sow the fruit.'<br>
Maturity has to come. To become bighearted, don't act like a child. Keep quiet. If someone talks childish, don't listen to them. Talk like elderly people. They become fruit.<br>
You keep the peace, stay calm, and enjoy. Break all conditionings. Within you live blood will flow with joy and happiness."</font><br>

The why not come out of this cycle [of births and deaths] in a year's time and if you wish you can do that in a week's time.<br>
You only have to decide once, just once. You can be immensely benefited by Sahaja Yoga just by deciding once like this. You should be surrendered completely. It is not necessary that you touch My Feet but should be surrendered to Me from your heart. Some people touch My Feet but are not surrendered in their heart. One has to be completely surrendered to Me from within. If you are completely surrendered from within then your Kuṇḍalinī remains established on your Ātmā Tattwa, just like the flame of a lamp, without any flickering.

"So, that Anna Mahārāj had come somewhere so I said that, "If he is seen somewhere call Me also." He was told that, "Mātājī is coming."<br>
I went. He was smoking a cigarette in front of Me and was talking in his Hyderabadi language something with these four or five women. Very comfortably he is [was] sitting. I went. I said, "How are you?" He said, "My gurujī left his throne to meet You in Bombay [Mumbai]." I said, "Why not? After all, I'm his Mother and he came to meet Me. Do you have any objection?" He said, "He should not have done that. He is this and he is that. He is gone case and so forth." I said, "Now see My way. He just broke your legs." So, I put kumkum to him and then as I was leaving I asked him to put kumkum to My forehead. Just as he put on My Āgñyā chakra I just pulled him inside. He just started shaking, "Mother, Mother, save me! Leave me!" <font color="DarkRed">I said, "First you tell Me that you will not criticize your guru." "No, I will not criticize my guru. Leave me!" "And secondly, you drop your habit of smoking." "Yes. Leave me! Leave me!" I said, "Thirdly you should leave the company of women and go and sit in a jungle." When he promised all three things only then I left his hands. Else he was almost fully sucked and he couldn't move his fingers from there.</font><br>
That drama was seen by all of them for a whole five minutes.<br>
Then he left that place and now sits in jungles. But he still did his old ways.<br>
Then I came to know that he was asking people to give him gold rings, of one and a quarter tolā [about 14.58 grams] and promised people that their problems will be over.<br>
"Mahārāj, this is too much." "OK, you give whatever you can. If you cannot give a one and a quarter tolā, just give half a tolā. Whatever you can manage." He collected thousands of tolās of gold like this.<br>
By God's blessing, he had a theft at his place and all his gold was stolen.<br>
So, he said, "This is Mother's work." I said, "Mine? But I did not get that gold‽"<br>

The first thing is that it is a vow of holiness.<br>
So the defects that happen to Gaṇeśha happen first from the eye. Gaṇeśha has a direct relation with the eyes and this Gaṇeśha Tattwa itself has disappeared from Pune.<br>
So in the middle of it where the optic nerves cross, there is the place of the Āgñyā chakra and the Āgñyā chakra is the representation of the Gaṇeśha Tattwa. It is a manifestation.

"Rabindranath [Tagore] wrote beautiful prose. A kid lost his way in the market and started crying loudly. People asked him what he wanted, [but] he kept on crying. <font color="DarkRed">People promised him to give a horse or elephant or all that but he said, "I just want my mother," and kept on crying. He did not eat and kept crying and became calm when he got his mother.<br>
......<br>
Say, you have some issue with your prostrate gland -- now I want to narrate My experience. I have a disciple named Agnihotrī. His name is Rajwade but as he has performed many important Yagñyas he is referred to as Agnihotrī Rajwade. He is a very committed Sahaja Yogi. Two, three years ago he came to Me and said that, "I don't have any issue except that of prostrate gland." I was very surprised. 'This [is a] very accomplished devotee and Sahaja Yogi and why should he have an issue with his prostrate?' Because the prostrate ailment arises due to the issue with the Gaṇeśh Tattwa or if Gaṇeśh gets upset with him. There was no reason for Gaṇeśh to be upset with him. 'As he was a committed devotee and had total faith in Me and was a very simple person, then why is the Gaṇeśh Tattwa working in the opposite direction for him?' could not understand. I told him, "Take some prasād." The prasād is in the form of chaṇa. When I gave this to him, his fellow person said, "Today, Dādā will not eat anything." I asked, "Why? Why are you not eating today?" He said, "Today is Saṅkaṣhṭi. Everyone says, 'You should not eat chaṇas on Saṅkaṣhṭi.' " I said, "This is the mistake."<br>
Saṅkaṣhṭi is Lord Gaṇeśha's Birthday. Now all of you are educated people. Even if some one tells you anything, you should use your intelligence. Should be alert always. We keep fast on Saṅkaṣhṭi. Saṅkaṣhṭi or Gaṇeśh Chaturthi are the Birthdays of Śhrī Gaṇeśha. If you keep fast on His Birthday, are you in mourning or what?"</font><br>

The young people should take responsibility in their own areas and take it upon themselves. They should meet over tea or otherwise.<br>
......<br>
<font color="DarkRed">It is a privilege to come for a Pūjā and for the sake of that privilege, next year all those who have come here must promise to give Realization to at least ten people. Each and every person must take that vow today and I will give you the Śhakti.</font><br>

"Now we have got, astrologically there are three and a half auspicious days where you don't have to consultant any uh ... any books of astrology, which are called as Pañchāṅg, to find out whether it is an auspicious time or not. For any Pūjā, for any [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] good work you have to do, people consultant, in India, the Pañchāṅg, is the book to find out which date is auspicious [and] which is not.<br>
One of them is today. Is a day you can do anything good, you decide anything good. <font color="DarkRed">Today is the day to take an oath, to think of something great, to visualize something big, to ask a boon, to do a big Pūjā, is one of the greatest uh day.</font> One of the, we call them muhūrtas, which where you do not consultant these books.<br>

<font color="DarkRed">'So I am going to be one of them. And we are going to enlighten the path of the people who want to have Self-realization.'<br>
All these great ideas come to us when we touch our depths. And we feel responsible for all the rest of the humanity.</font><br> 
But then we gradually realize that there are lots of problems with our us ... own being, and the Kuṇḍalinī goes back into it, comes up again, and you realize that you have to correct yourself quite a lot.<br>
Then this correction portion starts. You start thinking about yourself more than about others. And also other things which were identified with us like our own personal problems, our own personal ideas, ambitions, professions and all the things that, with which we have been enamored so far start peeping into our minds. <font color="DarkRed">And we start forgetting that moment when we got our Realization and all that we promised within ourselves to do.</font><br>
<font color="DarkRed">So, the New [Year] Day comes to remind you: 'Doesn't matter, whatever has happened has happened, is finished. Today a new day has come to you again for you to promise again. Again start your journey, know the sun has come. And now be refreshed, the newness bring[s] the freshness of life.' And then you again start, greater enthusiasm on the New [Year] Day, with new ideas, with new promises, with new vows and with greater understanding about Sahaj Yog.</font>"<br>

"Now I have found out: that Western people waste so much of their energy in decision-making. And what are the decisions you have made, so far? Like, What food should we have?'<br>
'What does it become ultimately, all the food that you decide to eat?' Same about our lives. 'When we think and try to plan our lives, what do we make out of it? What is the ultimate result of our life?', we should think.<br>
Because of this ego orientation, this decision-making is there. I'm amazed: how this decision-making about food has started!<br>
......<br>
Please take decision-making at zero. Say, 'I do not take any decision. I will not take any decision. Let Mother take the decision.' This is the way you can do it.<br>
Now, everywhere Sahaja Yoga is coming up, people are understanding, you have to discipline yourself! There is no idea of discipline! You try to disciplining others and nothing about yourself.<br>
Other ... everything that is living is disciplined. See on a tree how the leaves spread, how they discipline themselves and how they arrange themselves. Is there any fight going on?<br>
First of all, decision-making about food should be zero.<br>
Please stop all the meetings, I think that is also another ego trips going on. All the ego trips, meetings, what do you achieve? This. Better not have any more meetings.<br>
You better all sit down and quietly meditate within yourself. And work it out, properly. Your vibrations should be all right, that's the main point is.<br>
......<br>
Now, another thing I have to tell you is this: that, I was thinking that if you people feel all right, your vibrations are all right, if you are settled down, if you really become gurus -- guru means dignity, humility, meekness, understanding, lovable nature, all these things must be developed in you. You cannot suddenly become like that -- and [in] that case, you should decide to go to various places or in England and also outside. Uh-uh-uh ... I have arranged for that."<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"The shortcoming of our country is falsity. We speak any lie without blinking the eyelid. 'What happens? What can happen?'<br>
Must discard falsity. Sahaja Yogis should take a vow that they will not speak lies.<br>
Instead don't speak. Don't tell. We don't have the right to tell others.<br>
......<br>
Sahaja Yogi should develop an overall sense: that of discretion.<br>
There is no need to tell lies. People speak lies when they are afraid about something, when they need something. Why to speak lies when the Almighty Himself has awakened in you? When the Truth Itself has awakened in you, why to speak lies?<br>
So we should take a vow that, 'We will not speak lies.' The second vow that we should take is that, 'We will not speak lies.'<br>
'We must give up addiction' and 'We will not speak lies.' This is [are] our vow[s].<br>
......<br>
This is the third vow that you should take. 'Don't pay attention to trivial matters!'<br>
Whether to give two paise to the rikśhā person or three paise, well, pay three paise, does not matter. He brought you breathlessly puffing. Why do you further take away his breath? What will you lose if you pay him three paise?<br>
Learn to give. Don't calculate too much. Otherwise you will suffer. People who inordinately run after money also suffer inordinately from it.<br>
So don't account for each paisā and reduce stinginess. This is the fourth vow.<br>
......<br>
The next stage should be that of resolution. Just make a resolution: 'The awakening must take place. This power must be achieved.' "</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">The girl is taking the oath now. Listen to the first oath.</font><br>
<b>Dr. Warren Reeves:</b> And you put your attention to the Sahasrāra when you're saying these mound ... this ... saying these oaths. Because you're saying them, in your heart, to Śhrī Mātājī.<br>
The bride says: "I will help to keep your Mūlādhāra chakra in order. You hand over all wealth which is in your possession. I will take care of those things. You should only eat the food that is cooked by me or your brothers and sisters, and if taken outside the home, you will vibrate it. I will be loyal to you. And you will be loyal to me."<br>
Now you cut the first mound with your toe.<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> You first cut the thing.<br>
<b>Dr. Warren Reeves:</b> Cut with your toe.<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> <font color="DarkRed">These are actually not the oaths but demands. [Laughter.] Is a promise as well as a demand. It's a combination.</font><br>

<b>Dr. Warren Reeves:</b> "... all household work with my physical and spiritual powers. I will live with love and affection and will obey you. You should help me in my work and I will help you in the work of Sahaja Yoga."<br>
You cut the second one.<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> All right: that's it.<br>
<b>Dr. Warren Reeves:</b> And now the bride says the third oath: "I will keep my Lakṣhmī chakra in order, and you will respect my Lakṣhmī Tattwa. This will keep your Lakṣhmī Tattwa in order as well. You should give account of all you bring home. Nothing will be hidden."<br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Forget whatever has happened, whatever wrong you must have done in Sahaja Yoga. From today decide that, 'We will behave in the same way which suits to Sahaja Yoga as we are Sahaja Yogis,' we should say this in the beginning, in the middle and at the end, say it three times that, 'We are Sahaja Yogis, we will not do this, we won't do this as this is wrong.' We should start today's day with this resolution.<br>
......<br>
So there is only one importance of today's Pūjā, 'Correct your Gaṇapati and start the work with determination, and dedicate ourselves to Sahaja Yoga, with pure and clean heart surrender to Sahaja Yoga, and be good Sahaja Yogis,' we should take this pledge today.<br>
......<br>
Now the third thing is that with all these things we are doing, we must promise to God also that, 'We will know about Sahaja Yoga through proper understanding, reading every word of it, we'll master the knowledge of Sahaj Yog, we'll keep ourselves clean, and completely surrender our lives to Sahaja Yoga.' This is what you have to promise in your heart. Surrendering to Sahaja Yoga is actually surrendering to joy, bliss and peace. In that you are the gainer, nobody is a loser in it. This is how today we have to decide once for all.<br>
......<br>
Have all the strength, have all the courage, and go ahead with this promise onward, because I think now Sahaja Yoga is going to take a new turn. Definitely it is going to take. We are going to come up to a stage where thousands and thousands will join Sahaj Yog."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"In every birthday, we make a new resolution. Now I understand that I should also make a new resolution. And the new resolution is that the Vishwa Dharma that we've made and established and we all follow if anyone doesn't follow its maryādā, such a person should not have a right to be called a Sahaja Yogi. This is what I thought we should all resolve. Anyone who follows its maryādā, only he can be its follower. Any follower of Vishwa Dharma, who doesn't live by it, then we can't accept him as a Sahaja Yogi.<br>
For example, if a person takes dowry, believes in the caste system, class system, then he can't be a Sahaja Yogi.<br>
So I have decided today that anyone who calls themselves a Sahaja Yogi, they should not just have a complete understanding of Vishwa Dharma but if it doesn't reflect in their behavior, then they have no right to be in Sahaja Yoga. They should be told that they should atone for their mistakes and correct themselves as part of their atonement before they come back to Sahaja Yoga.<br>
......<br>
Tell your neighbors about it and say that, 'We believe in Universal Religion and not in any other religion.' If Yogis don't say that, then we can't accept them as Yogis. Sahaja Yoga is not for people who are scared to tell people in their society that they are followers of Vishwa Nirmala Dharma or those who are scared to tell others that they are Sahaja Yogis. You will have to fully follow the Maryādā of Sahaja Yoga.<br>
Some people tell Me that, "Mother, we sometimes drink a little alcohol, smoke a little, consume tobacco," then you are not a Sahaja Yogi. If a person doesn't follow the Maryādā of Sahaja Yoga, then he cannot follow a Universal Religion.<br>
And this Universal Religion of ours, we must keep completely pure as it's not just a Universal Religion, but Vishwa Nirmala Dharma. We can't allow any impurity to creep in, that's why anyone impure, can't come into it. Only those people who have fully accepted this Universal Religion and ensure that their behavior is within the maryādā can stay in it.<br>
This is the resolution I have made for My Birthday and I hope you will accept it with love."</font><br>

Today, you have to take a vow, because it's a new year's day, such a great day when we are here, to say that, 'Even if we have to give our lives, we give it for Sahaja Yoga because one life can save thousands!' Then why not do it?<br>
......<br>
So today, the first and the foremost vow is, as I told you, that we have to get cleansed up in such a way that become ... we become free of ego and superego.

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"I'm happy you went and saw Ajanta Caves: should show you how people were dedicated to built all that in ten centuries.<br>
They had not seen Buddha at all, Buddha never came to the South of India. Just believing in Buddha, what work they did, what sacrifices, how they built it! They had to go through very difficult times because there was no water, there was no communication, nothing.<br>
And they used the stones, you must have seen there, of different colors and different hues, which are created by Mother Earth. And when you break them, instride [inside] those egg-like stones, you get beautiful ... semiprecious stones. They dissolved them into some sort of an indigenous solvent and used it for painting. And that's how the paintings are today surviving.<br>
You can't see [the caves] without lights, so how they must have painted it at that time, what sort of eyes they must be having! The dedication gave them this power that they could built it. They carried on for ten centuries this work!<br>
If Sahaja Yoga can be carried for ten centuries, this world will be a different place.<br>
So one has to learn that we have to dedicate. We must fully dedicate ourself.<br>
We are not here to gain everything out of Sahaja Yoga. Like, in the beginning people have problems about their families. So they think that God should solve the problem because they have come to Sahaja Yoga to oblige Sahaja Yoga now, so God must solve their problems. Now they have problems of their jobs, God must solve the problem! If there're problems with their relations, God must solve the problems. That's the sort of a job given to God, because they have very graciously joined Sahaja Yoga. Then, after that God must give them money. He must provide them for everything, and He must look after them. For no commitment at all! There's no commitment. Nobody has any commitment in Sahaja Yoga. But God is committed! And God has to work it out. Then they start, some people, foolishly start using Sahaja Yoga for other purposes, like earning money or earning power, or name or fame or domination or anything.<br>
These are the steps which are going down, not upwards. And then, once you go down, you don't realize whether you are going upward or downward.<br>
So, in dedication one has to see: "What have I dedicated for Sahaj Yog? All the time I have problems, all the time I say, 'I can't do this because of that. I can't do that because of this. This is the problem. This I would like to do, this I would like to do,' all the time there's an 'I, I, I and I.' But what have I dedicated? What time have I given [coughs] to Sahaja Yoga? How much money have I given to Sahaja Yoga? Nothing at all!"<br>
People don't even take leave for Sahaja Yoga. They can't do anything for this!<br>
These people not only took leave but permanently went and settled in that place, in that far-fetched place. Without any machinery, without anything, they did that whole painting and the whole uh excavation and all that uh-uh-uh, what you call, the entire work of such a tremendous volume that is impossible in these modern times.<br>
Nobody can recreate something like that, with all your machinery, with everything: because people don't have dedication.<br>
So for Sahaja Yoga, we have to put ourselves onto a point: 'What did I do, what did I sacrifice for Sahaja Yoga? Nothing! Is only for my own child, or maybe for my wife, or for myself, or for my job, or for something.' What is our commitment?<br>
And without commitment purity cannot come in. Will go up and down like a yo-yo.<br>
We are committed to Sahaja Yoga! If there are even five people who are really, fully committed to Sahaja Yoga, it can be built up that way.<br>
But the problem is: everybody sh-sh-shares with each other this kind of noncommittal behavior. And that's something not good.<br>
Committed means-s-s: 'Even if we have to give our life we should do it. Even if we have to give up everything, we should do it.'<br>
But all other considerations are to be taken there, everything should work out, it's all should be joy all the time, must get your jobs, you must get your wives, you must get your everything, children properly done, everything to be done by Sahaja Yoga.<br>
And when this commitment will start, I'm sure Sahaja Yoga will spread like anything.<br>
Even falsehood, when people are committed! Like you see in all other religions: every religion they did that. And how much it has spread!<br>
Of course, Sahaja Yoga is blessings, is blissful, it blesses you all the time. It gives you a very long rope to hang you also sometimes, one must know: there's a blessing of that kind also.<br>
So one has to be very-very alert that, 'God has chosen us for such a very special work, and we have to be fully committed to Sahaja Yoga.'<br>
All those who are wise will take to this and understand that the life is only worth this. Otherwise it's useless, is good for nothing, it has no meaning. And this has to come from, first from the leaders, and then from others: complete commitment to Sahaja Yoga.<br>
It doesn't mean that you have to give up anything. For My sake you don't have to do anything. But for your own sake, for your own betterment, you have to do it.<br>
I hope next time when you come to India you will be coming better prepared for commitments.<br>
Is not only money, is not only uh-uh-uh your talking about, your saying about it, writing about it, but it is through your own being it should have happen. You all should become the source of energy, that: 'I want to emit all over the world that light which is going to enlighten.'<br>
No amount of artificially is going to work it out, but complete genuineniss [genuineness] within you.<br>
Look at these Saints! They had nobody, they had ... didn't have Mother to help them.<br>
This uh Gyāneśhwara's life if you read, you'll be shocked! He didn't have even shoes to walk! He was treated so's badly because His father was a saṃnyāsī and was married, so they said that, "He, These are the children of a saṃnyāsī!" They had no food to eat! They had to walk for miles together barefeet [barefoot].<br>
They had no blessings of the Mother on them!<br>
Despite [of] that, they kept to Sahaj Yog, they kept to their blessings of being one with God.<br>
Because they achieved that State.<br>
Now, all this is for your good, for your benevolence, that you get all the blessings. But that doesn't mean that you should stagnate, that you should not progress. One has to progress higher and higher.<br>
One has to decide the commitment: 'I have committed to Sahaja Yoga.' And that is what you have to be committed [to].<br>
May God bless you all!"</font><br>

Because human beings are so complicated, so complicated, that to understand them is very difficult.<br>
I request all of you that if you have to achieve divinity, the complicated nature should be completely reprimanded, and it should be renounced to. And you should say that you want to achieve that divinity by which anything that you touch gets nourished, vibrated and beautiful.<br>

<b>Yogi Mahajan [reads aloud]:</b> <font color="DarkRed">We, the Sahaja Yogis of the world, do declare that we have experienced Self-realization through Sahaja (Spontaneous) awakening of the Kuṇḍalinī as discovered and taught by Śhrī Mātājī Nirmalā Devī. We do declare that these are the benefits we have experienced in our own lives and see in the lives of others who have had their Self-realization.<br>
Our life becomes one of purity and simplicity.<br>
Before marriage we lead a very chaste life. We don't even like to listen to talk of sex. Sex we enjoy only in a sanctified and legal marriage.<br>
We enjoy monogamous or monandrous marriage with a Sahaja Yoginī of our choice.<br>
Husband and wife respect each other. They understand each other fully. There is very deep love between husband and wife, but there is no public display of romance, as it upsets our modesty and privacy.<br>
Children are an important part of our married life. Most children of Sahaja Yogis are born realized. We love children, our own and those of others. We enjoy watching their growth and their play. We enjoy taking them on holidays. We are not possessive of our children, and do not smother them with our affection and prevent the development of their own personality. We want them to be strong and settled within themselves so that they do not become impressed by wrong ideas, wrong behavior or fall under the influence of wrong types of media and advertising.<br>
We do not spoil them by letting them dominate us with their demands. Children mostly like our correction, and sometimes they correct us as well. We like to teach them proper manners and respect for others, to share with others. We like them to be clean, tidy and properly dressed. We do not let them be cheeky or insolent.<br>
We like to send them to registered Sahaja Yoga Schools, if they want to go, where they will get a high standard of balanced education, where proper moral conduct is taught and encouraged, where they won't be abused or subjected to immoral and wrong behavior.<br>
We love to watch their aptitudes develop, to support the flourishing of their innate talents, and encourage them in other fields of development. We like them to understand us and all other Sahaja Yogis, as well as all the cultures of the world, artistic, musical, literary, religious free from prejudice. We like them to understand and enjoy the beauty of the world and the natural environment.<br>
We enjoy our new found knowledge that comes through wisdom and inspiration.<br>
When we mature we are no longer afraid of the horrible aggression of modem methods.<br>
We spontaneously enjoy all the arts, but only those works that are beautiful and soothing, that give joy: works that are traditional or classical, enduring works of great masters of art, music and literature and works that inspire and praise the Divine.<br>
We do not enjoy things that are not respectable, that are vulgar, jarring on the nerves.<br>
We love to read and understand all the Scriptures and find the true message in them which we can verify through our new found vibratory awareness.<br>
We are very normal and we keep the company of all others who are abnormal or subnormal.<br>
We do not give up our jobs or our work but we enjoy the company of all the Sahaja Yogis, whatever work they may do or whatever country they may come from.<br>
We enjoy this vast ocean of beautiful people. We are no longer only limited to the company of our colleagues, but have friends from ail over the world.<br>
We would love to write about and publish all the miracles that happen to us through Sahaja Yoga, and also the miraculous Photos that we get spontaneously. But Śhrī Mātājī will not permit us to do so, because of Her modesty. She says, "No one would believe they are real."<br>
We like to find out about the activities of the religions, cults and anti cult movements and why they are trying to mislead people away from the Truth and away from the Reality of the Divine. We like to speak openly about our findings, without fear because we know we are speaking the Truth.<br>
We travel to different cities and towns, to mix with people and find out why they are so unhappy in their life.<br>
We love to create our own works of art. We enjoy the new inspiration we get from within to produce these works.<br>
We also enjoy mastering new skills besides our innate ones and then to create some things that are uniquely spiritual.<br>
We enjoy our work, whatever it may be, and try to excel at it. So many Sahaja Yogis have reached high positions in their fields whether they be lawyers, judges, industrialists, ambassadors, bureaucrats, doctors, architects or artists. These achievements they have reached through balance and respect for those who work around them.<br>
There is no aggressive ambition in Sahaja Yogis, we do not try to outdo our colleagues so they are very relieved. We are promoted because of our talents, respectability and understanding and not because we are always hankering after someone or doing sycophancy to any boss.<br>
We love to keep our homes open to all kinds of families. We like our homes to be welcoming, to be clean and tidy. We like them to be decorated with artistic and handmade goods of a high quality. We like to use natural materials for our homes, our clothes and on our skins.<br>
We do not like manmade plastics, nylons, etc.<br>
We love to help each other and are concerned for the welfare and well-being of others. We enjoy our generosity. We enjoy feeding people and giving them presents.<br>
We eat any foods we like, or that are good for our well-being, without greed or denial. We don't eat large animals (cows, horses, etc.), or food cooked in alcohol. We don't take alcohol as it causes us to vomit. We are also so contented that we don't need to escape from reality using strong drink or drugs. We are so relaxed we don't need to smoke. This also causes us to vomit.<br>
We have no worries about money. All our needs are catered for.<br>
Śhrī Mātājī will not let us read the Guru Gītā as it says that the disciple should give all his money and everything to the guru. We would happily do this as thanks to Her for saving us from our own destruction, but She will not take a single paisā from us.<br>
We would love to give Her a garden of flowers, but She won't let us waste our money and says that, "One is sufficient." We all would love to give Her, individually, birthday presents, but She will only accept one present that is given collectively. If we do forcibly give Her an individual present, She gives us a bigger one in return, so we have stopped giving Her individual presents. She ps always insisting we should not even give Her collective presents.<br>
She has only now allowed us to pay for half of Her traveling expenses.<br>
Only now can we pay for our food and travel in India. Previously She paid for all of us who went to India.<br>
She has bought houses to use as our Āśhrams which until recently were rent-free. She has never stayed in these as without paying.<br>
Previously all books and tapes were sold without any royalty payments. Now Śhrī Mātājī has agreed to accept some, but so tar nothing has been sent.<br>
She always uses the money collected for the spreading of Sahaja Yoga.<br>
Houses which are in the name of some Sahaja Yoga leaders, were completely built by Sahaja Yogis but now they have taken their homes back.<br>
Although we cannot give any money for Self-realization, or to Śhrī Mātājī in person, we do not object to giving some money, in trust, for the spreading of the teaching of Sahaja Yoga. We do not know of any organization or group that does not collect money for some reason.<br>
In most countries Sahaja Yoga is registered as a charitable, nonprofit society. Any money that is collected is kept in a bank with proper accounts.<br>
Śhrī Mātājī is extremely trusting of all Sahaja Yogis, but same have taken advantage of Her confidence and taken large amounts of money from Her personally. These people were asked to leave Sahaja Yoga. They were not even made to repay the monies they took from Her. They were just forgiven.<br>
We only trust Śhrī Mātājī, who has a great sense of public money.<br>
Whenever anyone makes money out of Sahaja Yogis and is found out, they turn against Śhrī Mātājī, most of these people are pardoned by Śhrī Mātājī. They have mostly fallen under the influence of their half-baked wives who have mislead them into these corrupt practices.<br>
In the twenty-one years of Sahaja Yoga hardly a dozen people have been asked to leave.<br>
Apart from wrongfully collecting money, people were asked to leave for the following reasons: homosexuality, flirting and adultery, mental disease, aggression and domination of others, particularly towards women. These people were given all opportunities to improve their behavior before being asked to leave.<br>
Some of them have since overcome their problems and returned.<br>
Some of those that were asked to leave have turned against Sahaja Yoga, but they never say why they had to leave Sahaja Yoga. We do not discuss them or bother about them as they are like a rotten apple and we are glad to see them go. If they are lying it is their misfortune.<br>
We are happy that we are not so unfortunate as to come to Sahaja Yoga, see the Truth and still misbehave and be sent away.<br>
Thus Sahaja Yoga is a Mahā Yoga. Never before in the history of spirituality has such a mass awakening of Truth been seen. It expects a very high moral standard from its participants because these are the innate qualities of a spiritual person who wants to do spiritual work.<br>
We are not a moneymaking concern so we do not require great numbers of people. We are only interested in people of spiritual depth and quality.<br>
Our precepts must be expressed in our practices and our life. We cannot be hypocrites.<br>
There is no prejudice on the grounds of color, race, religion, creed or financial standing. The only criteria [criterion] is spiritual growth, which makes us feel joyous.<br>
If we do make any mistake we would like Śhrī Mātājī to punish us, as a Guru does, but She punishes us by forgiving us.<br>
Even if we want to feel guilty for our mistakes She will not allow us to feel that way on the grounds that we are only human beings and slowly we will all improver by facing our mistakes.<br>
Even though we would like Her to give us constant advice and guidance, She makes us become our own gurus, to become the masters of our own lives and spiritual ascent (to know thy Self).<br>
If we write to Her confessing our past lives and sins, She won't read our letters. Instead She always tells us to be in the present.<br>
A true Sahaja Yogi should not commit sins because of his spiritual nature. This is very easy for us as we develop a great sensitivity to sin.<br>
We believe in the unity of all religions, which we know as a fact through our vibratory awareness, are all from the One Source of God Almighty.<br>
We worship all the Incarnations and venerate all the Seers, Saints and realized Souls of the past and present. We enjoy all their writings, poetry and works of art. We have discovered many saintly people who were never recognized before as great, evolved souls.<br>
We are against fundamentalism and the ignorance of organized religion.<br>
We believe in the unity of One World and One God.<br>
We respect our wives and all women as the mothers of children.<br>
We enjoy our virtue, faith and sense of security.<br>
We enjoy our peace, calm and forthright attitudes.<br>
We enjoy our responsibility for the awakening of the spirituality in man: to work for the seekers of the world with love and patience; to see the light in their eyes when they feel the actualization of Kuṇḍalinī awakening; to see thousands of people of every nation experiencing Self-realization; to see Germans, Russians, Jews and Arabs live in harmony together.<br>
We enjoy the purity of relationships of men and women as brothers and sisters. Any person in an Āśhram or one of our groups who is found flirting or dating is asked to leave. Thus we have no family complications.<br>
We enjoy speaking pure, correct language which is clearly expressed. We enjoy keeping silent and letting others speak. We enjoy the speeches of other Sahaja Yogis, and they also enjoy ours.<br>
We enjoy the sweet, loving nature of other people but avoid arrogance and aggression.<br>
We abhor vulgar, obscene and scandalous talk and gossip.<br>
We enjoy the fragrances of the flowers and nature.<br>
We enjoy food that satisfies the body and not the tongue.<br>
We love to discuss God Almighty and His Compassion, and also His wrath for the people who are evil.<br>
Our ears love to hear words of wisdom and the praises of God, melodious music that soothes the mind. We love to sing songs in praise of the Divine in a proper language with correct pitch, harmony and rhythm.<br>
We enjoy the purity of non-adulterous eyes.<br>
We enjoy watching our ego and laughing at it.<br>
We try to remain in a state of thoughtless awareness because it is only in this state that we can grow spiritually, as we are in the present. The past is over and the future does not exist. Only the present is the reality.<br>
We do not rationalize our mistakes or our achievements. It is God who is doing the work, not us.<br>
We are just the witnesses of His drama.<br>
We are not disturbed by past conditioning or future ambitions.<br>
We enjoy expressing reality and Sahaja Yoga in words and deed.<br>
We enjoy our strength and wisdom and the freedom we have from vanity, greed, hatred, jealousy and violence.<br>
We try to analyze and find out through discussion why all the religions have failed, why the Scriptures have been mutilated and misrepresented.<br>
We want to find out why people give money for God when He has no understanding of money.<br>
We study the cults and anti-cult movements to see how they affect the subtle center of seekers and spoil their chances of ascent into higher awareness.<br>
Many new facts we learn can be verified scientifically.<br>
We put this knowledge into practical use for the betterment of society.<br>
We have become aware, alert, wise, dynamic, relaxed and above all, enlightened.<br>
We enjoy the achievements of our young people and how they are saved from the corruption and immorality that abounds in today's society; how they are transformed from a lethargic and depressive life into a new dynamic, youthful life. We enjoy their amazing meteoric progress in their sports, art and music and in their scholarly capacity through their ascent.<br>
We enjoy knowing Śhrī Mātājī as our Mother.<br>
We enjoy the example She sets for an ideal life. She never demands. She is self-content and self-contained. Loving, can gently solving any problems we may have, always paying attention to our lives, She knows all of us and all the good things about us. She is the ideal housewife and mother, caring for all Her relations.<br>
We enjoy listening to Her husband speaking of Her many qualities as a wife and mother: how he describes Her capacity to do many things at the same time without any effort; how She has the love and respect of all the staff and officers of his work whatever office he has held; how even they coiled Her, "Mother."<br>
Through Her own example She has shown us how to live as good householders, and has saved many marriages through this example.<br>
She will not permit us to escape our social responsibilities by taking saṃnyāsa or turning away from society -- no matter how decadent it may be.<br>
Although She has so much power, She has never used it to manipulate anyone. On the contrary, She is so trusting that we fear She will become the victim of manipulation. But we have learnt that She cannot be tricked or manipulated.<br>
We enjoy the knowledge She has in every subject, except money and banking. All Her accounts and checkbooks are kept by Sahaja Yogis. They write for Her and She just signs.<br>
Her knowledge is very, very deep as well as wide on the subtlest of subtle subjects. She explains these in simple words.<br>
She never has to read anything but has a knowledge of English, French and Spanish literature.<br>
She knows many languages, especially Indian. Her mother tongue is Marathi. She never studied English, Hindi or Sanskrit languages at school because She was a medical student, but Her mastery over these languages is admirable.<br>
She has never studied psychology but She was invited lo speak on Jungian Psychology at the Jungian Society in New York.<br>
We enjoy giving Realization and curing people without using our egos.<br>
We enjoy our enlightened attention. Our attention sees the good points of others, and doesn't go to violence and aggression. It works quietly and keeps quiet.<br>
We are gifted with a new dimension in our awareness of Collective Consciousness. It can penetrate into any area of the subtle center of any human being and we know the problems as well as how to solve them. It also gives us knowledge of ourselves, judges us and cures us, it fills us with sell-confidence and humility.<br>
Our attention can go to the problems in the home, of our family and friends, of our country and the world, and it can go to international situations. Wherever we put it, it can work things out by offering solutions to bring freedom, prosperity and peace.<br>
Sahaja Yogis from all over the world enjoy communicating with each other about solving social, political and economic problems through their enlightened collective attention.<br>
Our attention goes to divine beauty, which is soothing and elevating and enjoys the best of all the world's cultures.<br>
We enjoy the love and compassion and innate virtues enlightened by Sahaja Yoga.<br>
We can laugh at our own faults and enjoy the good points of others.<br>
We enjoy knowing the Absolute Truth and absolute answers through vibratory awareness, free from doubts.<br>
We enjoy looking after the needy, especially children and our elders, through our vibratory awareness -- to diagnose diseases and cure the sick and the incurable.<br>
We do not ridicule the weak, but try to uplift them to our level of strength, power and dynamism through our loving attention.<br>
We enjoy the comfort of our Spirit and are not attached to the comforts of our body and mind as we are no longer the body, mind, conditioning or ego but the Spirit.<br>
We enjoy our knowledge like a cook enjoys a good meal he has cooked and we enjoy sharing it with others.<br>
We enjoy the Joy which has no duality of happiness and unhappiness, which only can be enjoyed after Self-realization has matured.<br>
We enjoy the hurdles created by our enemies because they challenge us to rise higher. Every disadvantage becomes an advantage. We enjoy blind and stupid opposition as a joke. We leave the aggressive and cruel in the hands of the Divine.<br>
We wish all the arrogant, scandalous liars to be prosecuted, testing the validity of the laws in the name of God and also the laws of all the lands.<br>
We enjoy the great task of the emancipation of humanity put on our shoulders.<br>
We enjoy rectifying all the horrible mistakes of the greedy, selfish, aggressive and cruel people, individually or collectively.<br>
We enjoy our powers because we never feel powerless as this is the Power of Divine by which is ever growing.<br>
This is how we enjoy the real spiritual life of the Kingdom of God.</font><br>

"So, in that reflection that you are Me, in that rekflection [reflection] that the Mother Earth is Me, in that beautiful creation within you, you have to become very sensitive to the need of the world, what is the need of the world. Today, if you fail, the whole thing will fail forever. Only very few will be there. So the need for you is: to s-spread Sahaja Yoga because this love is not only for you, is not to be enjoyed [only] by you, but is to be enjoyed by as many possible in the whole world.<br>
So, today we have to decide that, as the children of Ādi Śhakti, we have to go all out. Everywhere, every corner, we have to shout and we have to tell loudly what is the time in which we are living and what is the responsibility that you have to fulfill as Sahaja Yogis.<br>
......<br>
It is rather, rather difficult for Me to say something forcefully. That's not My nature, you know. Can't get into tempers, I cannot get angry. And I cannot forcefully say something to you, but, if you fail, then [the] only thing will be: that you have failed Me completely. It means that, nothing less than that.<br>
And if you don't want to do it, then I would request all of you to take a vow today that, 'We'll spread Sahaja Yoga and we'll talk about Sahaja Yoga, know about Sahaj Yog.'<br>
There are many who don't know anything! Also, it's very surprising: they are Sahaja Yogis, they don't know anything.<br>
And don't create problems for Me, like marriage: 'We can't now live with the wife,' 'We can't live with the husband.' All sorts of nonsensical problems people create for Me in Sahaja Yoga. Are you here to create problems or to remove problems of people?<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Now, you must all promise Me that you will not divide amongst yourselves, as you have done with all the others.<br>
[Before they could wonder what She means and who those "others" are, Śhrī Mātājī continues saying how, after the departure of each Incarnation, the followers of that Incarnation had invariably started to disagree with each other and started to create division.]<br>
[Śhrī Mātājī explains how at the time of Christ, they had allowed someone like Paul to take hold of the teachings, or how, almost immediately after the demise of Muhammad, human beings took over and created a division. She talks about how in many religions (Buddhism is also mentioned) human beings would change and distort the legacy of that Incarnation and create a system out of it.]<br>
[After a while Śhrī Mātājī says:] But you must promise Me that you will not do that to Me. If I am the Ādi Śhakti, then the one thing you cannot do to Me ... is that later on you will create division amongst yourselves.<br>
[Śhrī Mātājī is very concerned about the prospect that this could happen. She explains how the solution is in the fact that we have vibrations. If Sahaja Yogis truly are in the state in which the vibrations are guiding our thoughts and deeds, then such divisions cannot take place. She warns them that if division and discord do start to show up, it is a sign that they are not in tune with Her and the vibrations.].<br>
[The very fact that She warns them about it indicates that it is not all that obvious that human beings -- having been gifted with free will -- will follow the Divine Principles. Śhrī Mātājī emphasizes that it is a very important responsibility that we have to preserve Her legacy and keep it intact.]<br>
[She continues by saying that the other very important asset they have is collectivity. She stresses the importance of collectivity quite a lot, how -- as one body -- they must stick together and that they really must preserve unity and not allow division to take place.]<br>
[She urges them that, if they are Her children, they cannot allow this to happen to Her and to Sahaja Yoga. That this is a responsibility Sahaja Yogis have towards Creation itself.]<br>
[Śhrī Mātājī then makes them to promise to Her ... With calm determination She looks around at everyone in the room.]<br>
Now, will you promise to Me?"<br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"First of all, we have to take a resolution today that we have to clear our Āgñyā.<br>
The greatest issue at the Āgñyā is that we think that we are very superior. And we start thinking that we can rule the whole world, and that we can correct the world. When you yourselves are not correct then how can you correct this world?<br>
Now, you must have seen many people who think that they are very great, but do a lot of wrong things.<br>
In this country people take a lot of money. Tell Me how will God forgive us for this? The greatest of all sins are stealing and corruption.<br>
The person who commits these types of sins, whatever he may try, he may do Pūjās, chant mantras, read Namāz, call out to Allah, anything, he won't be benefited in any way.<br>
So, today, is a New year for you, I wish you all and I want you all to make a resolution: 'From today onwards, I will not tell lies, never ever lie.'<br>
Indians are very famous worldwide as liars. I do not know how but our country carries the stamp of being dishonest. Great Saints, Prophets have taken their birth here. How can people lie at a place where so many Sufis were born?<br>
So today, you have to promise that you will never tell lies, whatever may be the consequences.<br>
For that you need to have courage. Now that you are realized what more courage is needed?<br>
As it is you can't lie at all. It's only when you become like this, the people will be able to have faith that you are really truthful people.<br>
So, the Sahaja Yogis have to be truthful.<br>
Whatever may be one's occupation, whatever he may do, he may be an engineer laying roads, he may be a doctor, treating everyone, if in spite of all this, if you lie then it would be Hell for you. That is because you are now transformed. You are now realized. So when realized people lie they cannot benefit from it at all.<br>
When I go abroad, and often hear people say, that the people of our country are cheaters, liars and corrupt, I feel very sad.<br>
Today it is very auspicious day for you. Today let us all make a resolution that, 'We will never lie, whatever it may be.'<br>
I Myself am a woman, that too, an Indian. I have never said a lie.<br>
By telling lies it would be a loss for you, you will be put to loss by doing wrong deeds. By doing so, you may be earning more or cheat more but you cannot go to Heaven, you will go to Hell.<br>
One thing it is very important to know that we have a very bad reputation in the rest of the world. Why the bad reputation? Because, we are such type of people! When you come to know that someone is a liar, form an organization and make an enquiry into it.<br>
For example, if a road has been laid which is not good enough, then enquire about the amount spent in its laying and what was its sanctioned layout cost and what is he doing [what was it spent on]? The money that is made on out of the road will only be used for drinking and liquor, which is our enemy!<br>
Why do you want to do it? You are all very well-to-do people.<br>
I have seen many countries where there are poor people but they are very honest.<br>
So honesty should be the foremost quality in you.<br>
Today, make a decision that, 'We will never be dishonest hereafter. And we will not remain in the company of dishonest people and if any one is dishonest we will expose him.'<br>
Now it is like this, people will say, "Mother, in the Police Force, too, they are like this and in other departments too they are like that," but you are Sahaja Yogis. Those who are Sahaja Yogis, are nothing less than any policeman or any person in power. They are all-powerful.<br>
But all the powers are of Truth. Truthfulness should be there and I am very glad that a lot of Sahaja Yogis are truthful but we still need more Sahaja Yogis who are truthful.<br>
Truthfulness has to be there, otherwise your Āgñyā chakra will not be cleared. Āgñyā, is where the ego resides. When a person becomes egoistic, then he commits any kind of mistakes, he criticizes, harms, gets corrupt -- all such people will go to Hell.<br>
I want to tell you very clearly, that you should not take to corruption, you are not dying, that you have got to go to that extent. What have you done by earning more? What are you doing? You must have put up a few more lights, kept a couple of more women, what more than that? Now, what will be your condition when you go to Hell?<br>
I am discussing all this, on this day of Diwālī because Diwālī was celebrated on the occasion of Sītājī's reunion with Rāma.<br>
We can no more be slaves once we embrace chastity. We are our own slaves and not the slaves of others. We shall not lie for any reason whatsoever.<br>
I have lived in Delhi for a long time and am quite surprised at how much they lie. They are not afraid of lying at all. By telling lies openly they might benefit here, they might earn more money, but it is not known that they will not go to Heaven.<br>
I want the Sahaja Yogis to promise that neither will they lie nor will they support the people who lie.<br>
......<br>
Today is a very auspicious day and we have to light the lamps in our heart and take up the resolution that, 'We may die but we won't lie.'<br>
......<br>
The people who are throwing clutter in Jamunājī [River] are fools. 'Jamunājī' goes straight down to Hell.<br>
But you will be saved from that Hell. You are realized Souls. The one who is enlightened never falls.<br>
But if you really want to establish Sahaja Yoga fully within yourself then you have to first of all decide never to be dishonest in any way.<br>
Earning money is the only business left in this world! What happens with that? Nobody will even remember them.<br>
You have to be truthful if at all you love your country. Otherwise who is going to believe in a liar's love‽<br>
It is a very tough situation for you when you see that your neighbor is of such a type and you think that you too should become like that. On the contrary why don't you think that, 'We are like this and why not that neighbor, too, be made like us?'<br>
First of all you should promise that you will never be dishonest nor support any dishonest doers.<br>
It is not known, the thriving of liars is a curse of our country! There are many people who will tell at least ten lies from morning till evening, still it won't be enough for them.<br>
Now that your poverty has perished, all is well, you have everything to eat and drink and you are not a beggar any more, then why do you have to lie?<br>
So on this day, take this resolution: 'We are not going to lie and if anyone is a liar then we are not going to support that person, we are not going to establish any connection with him.'<br>
There is a lot of peace and happiness in this. You know a liar will go to Hell and you too, if you support him, you will go following him.<br>
God has given you Realization, you have been enlightened within. See, in that light, if there are other people like you, you should take a resolution that you will never tell lies. 'Let our heads be cut off, whatever it may be.'<br>
......<br>
So the first thing that you decide for sure is that, 'We won't do any dishonest deed at the same time if any one else does then we will get him exposed.'<br>
......<br>
So, today just promise, that, 'We are not going to be dishonest and if anybody is, then we all will unitedly oppose.'<br>
Why have you been given Sahaja Yoga? Why have you been given Realization? So that you can spread light.<br>
If you have no light internally then how can you spread light outside? And with that light you see, you are helping the dishonest?<br>
Nothing will happen if you earn a little less or more. If you are honest then God will help you!<br>
......<br>
Today all of you decide in your mind and take a resolution -- it is a very auspicious day today, very auspicious day -- that, 'We won't do any dishonest deed nor will we believe in dishonesty.''<br>
I have seen people who were neither dishonest nor did they go to the house of people who were dishonest. They had nothing to do with them because they were concerned not only about their own welfare but also the welfare of the whole country.<br>
So you are a Sahaja Yogi, so you need to make a promise that we are not going to do any thing dishonest.<br>
You just recognize a person who is dishonest and then tell your inner soul that, 'He is dishonest.' And, Sahaja Yogis, even if twelve Sahaja Yogis come together and if they come to know that he is dishonest then the Divine will be there to support.<br>
This country won't benefit by a few rich people, but it will definitely benefit by honest people.<br>
The greatest stigma that has been put on us is that we are dishonest.<br>
Those who are Sahaja Yogis can never be dishonest. We all have to be united, leaving aside all quarrels and assumptions that we are honest people.<br>
India's image is very much tarnished, hence take a vow today that, 'From now onwards we shall not be dishonest and if there are any dishonest people we shall all get after him.'<br>
......<br>
There are many such traditions in our country: they will drink liquor, drink wine. Tell Me, have you come here to become a fool?<br>
And don't be a friend of one who does it. Don't help them.<br>
I have seen people who go to the houses of people who drink liquor, then they too start taking liquor.<br>
But when you know that a person is of such a character, when you know that he is dishonest, then, stop eating at his place. You have nothing to do with him.<br>
We have to work for the well-being of our country because God has given us light. See in that light. His Power is tremendous. If you decide that, those who are dishonest to the nation will be taken care by God, then that alone is enough.<br>
But you are turning deaf. You are not able to understand. Such a person can never do any good deed, nor can he ever give. I cannot understand how they live so shamelessly.<br>
So, that is why today's message is that you have to take a vow that, 'We are not going to be dishonest in any way and if any one is dishonest then we are not going to support him. That is enough.'<br>
Many more realized Souls will come to our country. But who would like to come to such a dishonest country?<br>
So today the only message is that you have light and if you walk in that light, it will give you strength. You can do whatever you want to do.<br>
Look, we have achieved our Swatantra. Swatantra is the mechanism of understanding one's Self.<br>
Now I want a lot of realized children to be born, so learn that it is a very great day today, take a vow today that, 'Neither will we be dishonest nor support the dishonest.'<br>
Not even be scared of them: God is not with them at all. God is with you. If you are good, then God is with you.<br>
......<br>
Decide that we should be powerful ourselves.<br>
Today you decide, today is a very auspicious day, that neither will you be dishonest nor let others be dishonest.<br>
Your country will then prosper a lot.<br>
......<br>
So, today you all decide within yourself that you are not going to believe any dishonest people.<br>
......<br>
So, My only request to you on this auspicious day is that we should decide, we should never be dishonest, even if we have to die.<br>
......<br>
So the request to you all is to firmly decide within yourself that, 'We are not going to allow any theft, robberies, and wherever we find them we will fight it.<br>
......<br>
I have full hope that you will heed My words.<br>
So we should take a vow that we will not be dishonest and we would oppose the people who are dishonest.<br>
Understand that the greatest thing that our country needs today is honesty. There is nothing greater than that. Honesty is your mother.<br>
So what if you have one shirt in the place of ten? Tell the ladies also the same thing. It will happen. It will take place.<br>
Today's speech is a little different, it is unique and it is very gracious of you all to have liked it." [Applause.]</font><br>

"And <i>secondly</i>, it prohibits <i>that</i> few selected people do <i>not</i> obtain monopolized ownership over Self-realization by making it a buried treasure. Vibrations (Chaitanya Lhariyāṃ) increase by [through] distribution [distributing/giving]. If we don't give these vibrations to someone, then they become low [feeble]. Besides this <i>eternal [infinite] vibrations also flow from</i> the image (<i>Photo</i>) of Her Holiness Mātājī. <i>This is a huge boon [blessing] (varadān).</i> These peaceful and pain reducing [lessening] vibrations open our chakras and give boost to our own depth through being meditative, sitting in holy dedication in front of <i>Photo</i> (with open hands). <i>Do not know how many people have become disease-free through the Photo of Mātājī.</i> Few followers from us <i>first</i> enter into Sahaj Yog in <i>extremely</i> weak state [condition]. Consequently, <i>if</i> the first experience may not be [is not] strong [powerful] <i>also, even then</i> through daily meditation, the <i>desire of</i> duly [rightful] pure real truth, pure surrender <i>and</i> extraordinary feeling of self-surrender, the vibratory state expands successively (gradually) in the periphery of self-devoted awareness. <font color="DarkRed">In the process of this self-devotion we <i>need</i> enlightened expression and commitment.</font> This way <i>we can</i> dive deep in introspection [self-analysis] (ātmānusaṃdhān) after Self-realization and taking away our mind from all the subjects [topics], <i>we</i> become authority [entitled/master] (adhikārī) of achieving the highest state <i>by</i> centering in that Highest Tattwa through determination."<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"There is a tendency, built up in the West since the time of Enlightenment and the democratic revolutions of the 18th century, that we should be free to absorb all the unrighteous, unholy, inauspicious and destructive ideas that we can find in every film, every book, and every newspaper, whatever the source. Somehow people want to take up the challenge to become the evil force themselves. People have now to decide if they want to stop this democratic derailment by understanding what must be done. The progress that the West is proud of is towards complete destruction, as human beings have the freedom to achieve heaven or go to hell and also they have the tremendous power of rationality to justify their doom."</font><br>
