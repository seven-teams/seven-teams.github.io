Dear Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginīs,<br>
<br>
Jay Śhrī Mātājī!<br>
<br>
We are pleased to mention that this month we are completing 10 years since work on the database started and since the whole picture of the teams and subteams have been instantly envision as a natural extrapolation of an email received from a UK Sahaja Yogi suggesting, at that time, a 1 full year celebrations of 40 Years of Sahaja Yoga in UK.<br>
Of course, the Yearly Topics Team (YTT), which is completely independent from the CCT, had celebrated with posts the 40 Years of Sahaja Yoga in UK in 2014, and, we are told, starting from January it will celebrate 50 Years of Sahaja Yoga in UK.<br>
<br>
Related to CCT, in these 10 years we have started the first 6 Steps, and below we have gathered some of the milestones of each step individually.<br>

All these were only possible due to the tremendous help, contributions, and support from hundreds and hundreds of Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginīs from six continents and dozens and dozens of countries, for which we thank them all.<br>
Gradually, more and more collections will be started or will unfold/expand naturally, and our first and foremost thanks are to all artists and collectors, whether of Photos or of publications or personal writings or of anything else, for their dedication and devotion to Śhrī Mātājī, incredible art, generosity, and spirit of sharing. One can only hope that the team will give full justice to acknowledge and praise all their contributions.<br>
