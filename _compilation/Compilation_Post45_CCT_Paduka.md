<b>Gentleman:</b> ...... I know the meaning of this, but what is the significance of keeping them [shoes] 'on the table'?<br>
<font color="DarkRed">Śhrī Mātājī:</font> <font color="DarkRed">What is the significance of Bharata carrying the pādukā of Rāma, in the same way.</font> All right?<br>
Have you read Rāmāyaṇa or not, or your ...?<br>
<b>Gentleman:</b> [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] read Rāmāyaṇa.
<font color="DarkRed">Śhrī Mātājī:</font> Then all right.<br>
<b>Gentleman:</b> [<font color="orange">unclear</font>].<br>
<font color="DarkRed">Śhrī Mātājī:</font> So that is the significance.<br>
And for this also, you have to understand, first of all, vibrations. Where are the vibrations? From where the vibrations are coming?<br>
Then you will know the significance. It is not mental significance: it's actual. Then you will know, What does these shoes mean?', 'What these hair mean?' Everything you will know. All right?<br>
But do not put ... put attention to these.<br>
For example, you see, Indians always ask a question, 'Mother why do You where a white sāṛī, You are a married lady?' All right.<br> 
See all funny things these,  this not important.<br>
The main thing is: you must get your Realization first, then you will know what everything means, what it says, because it's another realm altogether.<br>
Like I've seen in England, anybody who sees My this thing [bindi], immediately start laughing.<br>

"But uh-uh-uh ... Sītā went with Him, and She supported Him. And ultimately, it so happened that uh-uhh ... Rāvaṇa came and took away Sītā.<br>
But Śhrī Rāma fought Rāvaṇa, killed him, and brought back His wife.<br>
But when They came back to Their own capital in Ayodhyā, there was a big jubilation.<br> 
<font color="DarkRed">And Bharat, His brother, he was very much attached to his brother, and he ruled that country with the pādukā, they say is the uh-uh-uh kind of sandalwood yuh-uh-uhh ... chappals they use[d] of his brother. He put it on the throne and ruled.</font><br>
So that is how the Bharat Milan, the meeting of Bharat with Śhrī Rāma, is celebrated, and that was the time He was crowned also as the king.<br>
So it is long time back, thousands of years back, this thing has happened.<br>
That jubilation is very significant: that the right king gets His own throne, and He rules-ss. And all the injustice and all kind of atrocities He has gone through has to be completely finished from His life. And that's why Diwālī is important."<br>

"I'll give you an example of Gujarat. Apart from anything, Gujarat people are very money-oriented: they are worried with the stock exchange, this, that, all the time money, money, money, money, money. Even if they are abro... abroad, they are extremely money-oriented. Sometimes I am surprised. It's impossible to talk to them about Sahaja Yoga. And they like artificial [laughing:] type of things like some gurus or somebody. I don't know from where did they get this.<br>
<font color="DarkRed">Whatever it is, we have a state [city] called Bhavnagar in Gujarat. Bhavnagar people came, they brought for Me those silver slippers, pādukās, to be vibrated. I was surprised, I was happy at least: that these people are thinking about it. So, they did a Pūjā, they did a Havan in Bhavnagar, and also in Baroda.</font><br>
These are the two places were not touched even, touched even, by the bhūkamp [earthquake], by the earthquake. Can you imagine? And Surat which is very much distant, was absolutely shattered. There are Sahaja Yogis, very few, all of them were saved, and their houses also did not move.<br>
This is between the protection of your Mother and the wrath of God Almighty.<br>
One has to understand this very well, that He has powers over all the elements."<br>
