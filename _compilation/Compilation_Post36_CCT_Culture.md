<font color="DarkRed">"Without spirituality science has no culture. Does science know on what love feeds on? The meaning of love, or how a living thing works, science is not able to tell about it."</font><br>

"In the democratic country there is a wild race for creating new wants and new problems to make the machines work for twenty four [twenty-four] hours. The house hold [household] is filled with all junk showing the relics of the dead desires. <font color="DarkRed">To counterbalance we have movements of anti-culture who take to other desires of drugs[,] ect. [etc.]</font> In the communist countries the desires are controlled by force and regimentation but once these bounded people get to the so-called free countries they become wild like primitive people.[,] worse than the free people[.]"<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"In guiding the creation of an atom into this complex universe and in planning the evolution of a single cell into this wonderful human being, there is a hidden hand of a very great Artist-artist because through his creation He expresses Himself, He sings, He dances, He paints, He acts and above all, He compels the spectators to reflect. Yes, He created this world because He wanted to reflect Himself, His Truths, His Beauty, His Grace, His Compassion, His Sweetness, His Righteousness, all that can be termed as culture."

Artists have to raise the taste of public eye to their standards of taste and not to stoop down to the cheap demands of the public and thus surrendering their freedom. This can be done by contacting educational and social institutions by the enlightened artists. Through articles in magazines and newspapers, the idea[s] of such artists can be propagated. Through dramas, films and radio talks, people can be educated for the understanding of real art. Thus the dignity of art can be maintained.<br>
By coming in contact with the public at large through these societies, the social self of an artist will develop into a keener and a [more] sensitive being. It will react to the slightest unrest in the nation, to the slightest imbalance in the society. If he sees a leper on the street, his heart will pour out with such sympathy through his art that he can create an atmosphere by which social workers, doctors, scientists and the people in charge of the state will be forced to think of some solution to the problems of leprosy. If an artist finds his countrymen being unpatriotic or cowardly, he can through his art inspire them and can serve the role of a brave soldier. Thus he can serve the society through other by creating a deep impact on their minds. Such is the motivating power of an artist. They are the loveliest flowers of the creation, the sweetest dreams of the Creator and the dearest parts of the human society. Perhaps, they do not know how they are loved, worshiped and followed by their spectators.
This is my humble concept of art, culture and artist. In my honest efforts, I have tried to suggest certain ways and means by which artists can get united and give a lead to further the cause of art.</font><br>

"As if don't know what is this thing which came from God, which is to be given to this world ... And the Truth is that, 'It is!' No doubt about it.<br>
But even after knowing this Truth, I won't call it their fault but the reason for their shortcoming is that they did not get birth in Yoga Bhūmi [Land of Yoga] of India. Don't know why God gave birth to such great people on that bhoga bhūmi [land of materialism] and you people have got birth on this Yoga Bhūmi. <font color="DarkRed">That bhoga bhūmi where they have no culture.</font> They don't even know if they have to wear sindūr [kumkum] on the forehead or on the nose. They don't know the protocols of Pūjā, they don't know the protocol of praying, they have no knowledge about God. They don't know even how to sit on the ground. They don't know anything, they don't even know how to give claps while performing the Āratī.<br>
And such great Souls, so innate they are, so loving.<br>
They love Me so much, such respect they have towards Me that I am surprised. Whenever they walk in front of Me, in fact they don't, but whenever they pass they bow and pass with their head bent down. They love Me so much that anything in this whole world has no meaning for them in front of Me. They have such deep feeling for Me that they don't know how should they respect Me, in what way. I am surprised that how they have so much understanding of all this about Me."<br>

Your baiṭhak [sitting capacity] should be perfect. It should be strong.<br>
I can't even tell them about baiṭhak. They don't even know this word. English language is useless. They don't have any culture of that sort, no talks like this. So unfortunate they are.<br>

"Now, you are seeing that in this world there are people chanting 'Hare Rāma, hare Kṛiṣhṇa'. In London, so many of their disciples come to Me and they have cancer here.<br>
This is a fact that I am sharing with you. I am your Mother and I have to tell you what is false.<br>
They have cancer here.<br>
You will be surprised that in this throat resides Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. When anyone faces a problem in the throat or in the cervical plexus then the name of Rādhā Kṛiṣhṇa has to be taken in the science of Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
Now look at their Kuṇḍalinīs which are not awakened and Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa is sitting angrily at this point. He has disappeared from there. What is the reason? <font color="DarkRed">We think, 'Oh, they are spreading our culture!,' though they don't spread any culture. I have seen their ponytails falling off, their dhotīs [lower garment worn traditionally in India] falling off and it looks so ugly.</font>"<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Now to say of Indian culture and Hindu culture and Muslim culture and other cultures, it is most surprising that Kuṇḍalinī, or we can say the Primordial Kuṇḍalinī of the Virāṭa, has got all these Great Incarnations -- whether they were Muslims, whether they were Christians, whether they were Indians -- seated on the chakras."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"What a great thing of Sahaja Yoga! I have talked about it a day before yesterday, that the power of Sahaja Yoga is tremendous.<br>
Once you receive this Power of God Almighty, then you enter into new Kingdom, and God is the King of that Kingdom Himself.<br>
You don't have to say this later that, 'Don't speak in Marathi, don't speak in Hindi, don't speak in ten languages.' You only speak one language, have one Kingdom. Unify the whole country!<br>
There should be only one United Nations.<br>
It happens that way because you all are one, that you have only taken in a way that, 'We are different,' or you think, 'It's given by this form by God.'<br>
We are different, you are different, and you are all one from inside. That is, it has the power to connect, it is inside to connect.<br>
Even the word connected is not right. You are one from inside.<br>
You are the only one in infinity, means the Power to show that you all are one is awakened. It means Sahaja Yoga is unified and bringing everyone together. This means it integrates everyone, it brings integration to each other.<br>
Everyone seems to be doing well. 'It's good in this culture,' 'It's good in that culture.' 
Someone is better in that, and the other one is better in another.'"</font><br>

"I am not in opposition for English language, but the language of Ātmā is Sanskrit.<br>
They have never bothered about the Spirit.<br>
You see, so we have to use some common language with [which] speaks about Ātmā. English language is not sufficient enough, I must tell you.<br>
They do not have those experiences because this is so far they have not gone deep into it, and we are very old people, ancient people. <font color="DarkRed">Our culture has been to know God, and everything has come in Sanskrit because Sanskrit is really a Devavāṇi [language of the Gods].</font><br>
Apart from that, when the Kuṇḍalinī moves, She makes sounds, She makes different sounds, which we -- they are really Devanāgarī sounds, all of them are, on all different chakras they are. If I have time I might tell you all those sounds that It makes.<br>
So our Sanskrit is really a Devavāṇi, and even when you say mantras, then, through the Sanskrit language or Devanāgarī pronunciations only, you can excite them better."<br>
