Dear Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginīs,

Jay Śhrī Mātājī!

As part of the celebration of the 51st anniversary of the <font color="DeepPink"><b>Sahasrāra Day</b></font>, we are pleased to offer at the Lotus Feet of our Divine Mother and to bring to your attention the <font color="blue"><b>Eternal Moments</b></font> website of Photographs of Śhrī Mātājī that was started in 2018. 

<i>The website treasures the eternal moments with Śhrī Mātājī by organizing some of Her Photographs within collections as well as chronologically.</i>
The link to the website is:
<a href="https://eternalmoments.smugmug.com/"> link</a> 

The website has currently 6,379 Photographs of Śhrī Mātājī, including versions. More than half of the Photographs come from 9 collections. Among the 9 collections, 7 of them were shared with us (first to work on them by titling them and eventually to upload them to the website). The eighth collection is the one of Ray Harris that has been around for many years but only partially dated. A ninth collection was added as the titles for the 1982 to 1984 period Photographs help the database.

We hope very much that you will enjoy the <font color="blue"><b>Eternal Moments</b></font> website.

At this moment we are seeking your feedback on the website and we are considering enlarging the team.

The Photographs of the website can be currently extracted in many ways, say by copying. Until the download buttons are activated, the extracted Photographs will not come up with their displayed titles. But the extraction part suffices for most projects. We aim to activate the download buttons in the next couple of months, once the links to Galleries are better set up. 

We thank you in advance for any help, support, and feedback. Please write to us at sahajayoga.compilations@gmail.com

Jay Śhrī Mātājī!
