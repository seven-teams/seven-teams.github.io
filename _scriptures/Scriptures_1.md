Dear Brothers and Sisters,  

We would like to begin the scriptures' posts with a collection of quotes from Shri Lao Tze and Shri Confucius, two primordial masters who incarnated in present day China, around 500 BC.  

***"The Primordial Master is always placed in looking after our Void, in sustaining us, and giving us a model of an ideal master...Confucius has taught the humanity how we can improve our relations with other human beings. But Lao-Tse in China has very beautifully described Tao, meaning the Kundalini." - Shri Mataj Nirmala Devi***

The booklet can be downloaded from the following link (also attached with this post).

Jai Shri Mataji!
