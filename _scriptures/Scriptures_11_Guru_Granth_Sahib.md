<b>Quotes</b><br>
<font color="red">Guru Nāṇak Dev has made lot of references to Kuṇḍalinī awakening in the sacred book, Śhrī Guru Granth Sāhib. Kuṇḍalinī has been referred to as Surati and Daśham Dwār [Tenth Door], means Brahmarandhra or opening up of anterior fontanel area on Kuṇḍalinī awakening.</font><br>

<br>
<font color="red">These brief reviews [stanzas from Śhrī Guru Granth Sāhib] illustrate that the theme of Kuṇḍalinī awakening referred to variously as Rebirth, Resurrection, [True] Baptism, Union with Divine, Tao [of Lao Tze], is common throughout mankind's history in all the religions of the world. In fact, this is the essence of all the religions, though because of time and place constraints, it was kept a hidden science in the past.</font><br>

<font color="red">During the times of Guru Nāṇaka, He felt that all kinds of men are printing. He understood that. So He made Guru Grantha Sāhib using books of only realized Souls of that time. He said, "Not to read anything else. Whatever is written in it, follow that."<br>
But you all know how they manipulated this Grantha.<br>
Bible was written, it was manipulated. Qur'ān was written, it is also manipulated.</font><br>

<font color="red">There was a boy, a Sikh boy who came to see Me. He was a very good boy. He came to see Me and he said that, "Mother, ah we are all followers [of] Guru Nāṇak, but somehow I am not convinced about the way Sikhism is going on. And uh Kabīra has said uh in our Granth Sāhab that, 'You should get your Realization,' and I haven't got it. Then how long are we to go on taking the name of God?" And I was surprised at his alertness about thing, that you have to have the experience of God. I said, "All right, it's a very good idea." And the he got his Realization. He is a young boy, very young boy.<br>
But when he got it, just like, 'Eureka! Eureka!', he went to his people. He told all the Sikh people, "What are you doing here? Come along! There is a way, what Mu [Guru] Nāṇaka has said! There is a way to get it. Why don't you get it all of you?" And he brought so many! And he used to speak! People said, "Mother, we could not believe this boy could speak!" They said he used to speak so well and whatever he had heard, you know. He said that, "I, eaty [every] day [they] used to read knuh Grantha Sāhab" to him when ... He said, "I was half asleep. I used to be tired. They would read two and half days continuously, I would be tired. But somehow, all these things that they read, they came to Me." And I ... he would recite all these poems and everything, and he was telling about how Nāṇaka was saying about Sahaj Yoga. People were amazed at his thing. And so many Sikh people came to Me because of him. Own, his own father, mother, everybody.</font><br>

<font color="red">The way Kabīra lashes people, you can see that He is tremendous! He is like Bhairava.<br>
And the Power of Bhairava, Kabīra has used in His language, but for Hindi poets it is Sadhukaddi [vernacular dialect of Hindi+Punjabi+Māravāṛī in medieval North India] and they have made fun of it.<br>
The best thing of a person who doesn't want to face reality, is to make fun of everyone. That is the best way.<br>
They said, "What is this talk, 'Iḍā, Piṅgalā, Suṣhumṇā'? Who is He? What does He think of Himself?" But He was appreciated, very much, by the Saints and specially by Guru Nāṇaka, who included all His poetry in His Grantha Sāhab.<br>
He's included so many of these poetry from all the realized Souls from Ma... Maharashtra, also.</font><br>
