<b>Quotes</b><br>
<font color="red">Now, all this from ninety-nine ... to hundred and eight is Kuṇḍalinī Yoga [from Lalitā Sahasrānama]. You should remember these names by heart, is good idea. Is not much! From ninty-nine to hundred and eight, how many they make?<br>
[Some answers.]<br>
Nine names []? So not difficult for you to know.<br>
And all the ... they have given the chakras on this, you see?
Now, nobody knows Hindi.<br>
She can read it. All right.</font><br>

<b>112 Quotes</b><br>
<font color="red">Mantras 'Twam Bhavānī', 'Twam Durgā', 'Twam Ambikā', etc. are good for Iḍā channel, but when you are established in Sahaja Yoga, you will have to say 'Ahaṃ Bhavānī'. However this Mantra can be said only when your purity becomes one with that of 'Ahaṃ Bhavānī' and I tell you now itself that this will happen.</font><br>
<b>1901-0000 Letter to Rājabhāī Modi and other Sahaja Yogis (Marathi) from Nirmala Yoga, Issue 14 (March-April 1983), Pages 10 and 39 (perhaps London, 1975)</b><br>
<br>
[After a Sahaja Yogi reads and says, "Auṃ Śhrī Bhavānī namaḥ. Salutations to Her who is the mistress of everytning that is coming to be."] <font color="red">Bhavānī []. Bhava means: to manifest. Whatever is manisfested [manifested].</font><br>
<b>1982-0515 Śhrī Lalitā Pūjā, Understand Your Own Importance, House of Gillian Grimshaw, 11 Vallance Road, Hove (next, W of Brighton), UK</b><br>
<br>
[At the end of the Śhrī Devī Pūjā:] <font color="red">As Bhavānī, as the consort of Śhiva, She doesn't wear anything very ornamental, as if the oneness with Śhiva sucks in all that is manifesting outside. So, not much ornaments or anything are to be used. Again, this is to make them [you] understand -- on rational level is difficult.<br>
But all this manifestation is when you are not one with Sadāśhiva. But once you become one with Him, then your identity is lost, no duality anymore remains. So, the question of 'me and my power' does not arise, 'me' and 'my power' become one. Sādhaka.</font><br>
<b>1984-0229 Śhivarātri Pūjā, Bring Śhiva Tattwa to the Brain and Practice the Śhiva Tattwa by Practicing Detachment (Fifth Dimension in the Human Being, The So-called Limited Brain It Has Become the Unlimited Spirit, and After Realization a Complete Detachment), Banks of Chandrabhāgā River near Śhrī Viṭṭhala Temple, Paṃḍharapūr, Maharashtra, India</b><br>
<br>
<font color="red">So keep this thing in mind: as Goddess Bhavānī gave a sword to Śhivajī Mahārāj and made him effective, that same Bhavānī is speaking in front of you. She can make you reach you at such a level, you don't even have any idea about it.</font><br>
