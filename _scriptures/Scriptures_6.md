Dear All,<br>
<br>
After quite a long interruption, we would like to restart the posts of the Scriptures Team.<br>
If you would like to be part of the Scriptures Team please write to us at<br> 
<b>shuddhvidya@gmail.com</b><br>
At its peak, the team had 6 members but now we would like to restart from scratch using the Divine Treasures website which has just refined its system of tags.<br>
The team will aim at high quality posts that combine quotations with commentaries, everything related to and in the light of the Divine Teachings of our Holy Mother.<br>
Posts could be individual or collective (worked out by subteams), the overall team overlooking to improve the quality as much as possible. Teams (topics from Scriptures) could be individual choices or assignments.<br>
The formats of the posts are flexible, and it includes all old formats and many new ones.<br>
As a first such new format, we would like to start with the Al Qur'ān (Holy Qur'ān). Please have a look at the link
<a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/scriptures/2022/0604">Post 5: Al Qur'ān</a> which currently is a '3 minutes read' and which in due time will be a 'several hours read'.<br>
Looking forward to receiving your support, feedback, cooperation, and help.
</p>
