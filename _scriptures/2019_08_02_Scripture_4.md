Jai Shri Mataji  

Please find attached the pdf file of quotes from the Old Testament about <font color="blue">Shri Abraham</font>. They were obtained by searching for Shri <font color=“red”>Abraham</font> and <font color=“red”>Abram</font>. 

Please share the file with all our brothers and sisters.

Shri Abraham (born Abram) was the son of Terah, a direct descendent of Noah. 
His main two sons were called: Ishmael (born to Hagar) and Isaac (born to Sarah). 
He withdrew at the of 175 (Bible) years.
