<b>Quotes</b><br>
<font color="red">The-ee ... great writer who is living now in England, his name is Doctor Mascaró, you might have heard his name, he has written lots of treatises about uh-uh Gītā, and Upaniṣhada[s], also Dhammapad, and also Bible. He is a master. And he is a master of Sanskrit language.<br>
I went to see him, and he gave Me a flower, such a beautiful couplet from Gītā, and he said that, "Mother, give us light. Give them all light so that they can see. Please give them." I said, "I'm doing that!"<br> 
I'm doing that, but, somehow, people do not know what to expect within themselves.<br>

<b>Seeker:</b> But the Lord Buddha said, "Now, birth is suffering, death is suffering."<br>
<font color="red"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b> Yeah's, that's true. But not Realization. [Some laughter.]<br>
You see, what He has said is: Buddha had it asked you to limit your desire, of ascent.<br>
Because people talked of God, once they talked of, in India for example, they talked of the Deities. That was a problem, because it became a talk again. Then they talked to God uh-uh-uh ... God which was ab ... abstract, uh-uh-uh like you can say Jehovah, and other things, because they wanted people to uh-uh-uh get over their uh-uh-uh st... stuck up points, you see. Nothing worked, you see!<br>
So Buddha said, "All right, let's talk only about the Self-realization, nothing else. Not even of God: let's talk of that only! Let people get to Self-realization, then we'll talk about God." So He said, "All right: only Self-realization! No God, nothing!" That was His job: to fix you up with the idea of Self-realization. He said, "Don't worship anything, don't do anything, get your Self-realization!"<br>
They are worshiping every-thing under the sun, this Buddhist! What am I to do?<br>
So whatever Buddha has said, is, everything is re-said in Sahaja Yoga.<br>
"Buddham śharaṇaṁ gacchāmi." "I surrender myself to the Enlightened One." The one which is enlightened is your Spirit.<br>
"Saṅghaṁ śharaṇaṁ gacchāmi": "I surrender myself to the collectivity."<br>
Unless and until you are a collectively conscious person, how can you surrender?<br>
Buddha also, whatever He said, is not understood before Realization. You cannot.<br>
"Dharmam śharaṇaṁ gacchāmi": is the sustenance within you.<br>
Śharaṇaṁ means you become that! Is not a mental thing, 'Oh, I surrender myself!' But you just become!<br>
You become the Enlightened One, you become the collectively conscious, you become the dharma, the sustenance, the religion within us. You become! That's what He meant.<br>
But for them, "śharaṇaṁ gacchāmi," means take a wheel in the hand, go on, "Buddham śharaṇaṁ gacchāmi," now [puts the right hand on Her forehead]. What this wheel is going to do I just don't understand, you know! They go on [for] hours together: they'll go mad! They will end up into lunatic asylum, believe Me!<br>
Or like mad, you are saying something, all the time praying: is that the way you are becoming?<br>
They don't even know where is Buddha placed within yourself!<br>
But Sahaja Yogis know where He is placed and how to please Him.<br>
Whatever He'd said is nothing but Sahaja Yoga, absolutely, hundred percent!<br>
Actually Buddha was nobody else but an Incarnation, who reincarnated Himself as Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya. You can see it clearly that it was He! And can be proved on Kuṇḍalinī again! You see, how can I prove it‽<br>
To understand Them, first you get your Realization.<br>
Again, I am talking like Buddha only!<br>
He tried some things, by which He thought people would take to Realization, with human beings, as they are. He thought, 'They are very much involved in materialism, take them out. Try this, try that,' nothing works out. 'Not this!' </font><br>

<font color="red">In any book whatsoever, take it Bible, or go to Qur'ān, or go to any book, Zen, go to Buddhist, uh-uh-uh books of a Dhammapad, or you go to any other Śhāstras, like Vedas, they have talked of Kuṇḍalinī all right.</font><br>

<font color="red">Is not like Buddha's time when they had to give up their whole kingdom. Everything to dhamma! Every pā'ī [1/3 of paisā], everything that they had, even their hair, I think. Everything to dhamma! And just come absolutely bare! No children, no wife, no father, nothing! That was Buddhism. That was Buddha's style.<br>
He had His disciples like this, and they used to walk miles together! [They walked] to preach from one place to another in thousands.<br>
What an impression it must be on people, when they see all this.</font><br>

<br>
<font color="red">The other day, I was reading about people who are now getting frustrated with Christianity and trying to go to Buddhism or want to go to Islam or anything. They are just the same! There's no difference.<br>
Because what Bible is, or what Christ is, is very different from Christians. What Islam is, is very different from Muslims. That's what all of them admit also. What Buddhism is, is very different from the Buddhist. So what they preach, what they talk about.<br>
The other day, I was reading a book on Islam, I was surprised: is saying the same thing!<br>
Also if you read, say, Buddha, Dhammapad, it says the same thing. Or, these Christian Sciences people, they say the same thing.</font><br>
