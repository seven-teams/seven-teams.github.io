<b>Quotes</b><br>
<font color="red">And after many Incarnations on this Earth, They gave Realization to some people, but very few. And then these people later on started giving Realization to others.<br>
We can say that this all started with Paraśhurāma. When Paraśhurāma was incarnated it was the beginning of individual spirituality. People started learning spirituality by going individually to the forest. But Paraśhurāma was [an] Incarnation.<br>
And with Paraśhurāma, Śhrī Ādi Guru Dattātreya had also many Incarnations. But due to Śhrī Dattātreya's collaboration in Śhrī Paraśhurāma's Incarnation, one in karoṛs or lākhs used to get his Realization.<br>
And after this, He also used to sit in the forest. He was next to the Incarnation. People used to get cured by going to Him in case of need. They thought, 'He is a Saint, we should pay our respects to Him.'</font><br>

<font color="red">The first one is Śhrī Lalitā, the Goddess Śhrī Lalitā, which is the Goddess of Beauty. She is the joy-giving: Sarvānandamayā. Gives the joy from everything. In every created world, in every particle, in every form, there is a power which gives us joy. This power is the Joy ... is the Power of Śhrī Lalitā. She is called as Mahā Tripurasundarī. Parā-parā Ati Rahasyā Yoginī. Means: Parā-parā Ati Rahasyā, the One who knows the secrets. The Parā-parā means: the One that is beyond of the beyond. The secrets of that area, the One who knows is Śhrī Lalitā, who is the Yoginī. At this stage, She is Bindu Sarvānandamayā: She is the Dot which is joy-giving.<br>
Second power, or āvaraṇ, means the enclosure, is like a triangle. She is Sarvasidhhipradā. She is the One who gives all the siddhis. She has got three sides. She's called as Tripurāmbā: Kāmeśhwarī, Buddhvajreśhwarī, Bhagamālinī are the three Yoginīs.<br>
Third one is called as Atharva Sarvarogahara, this is another enclosure. The name of the Goddess is Tripurasiddhā Ati Rahasyā, meaning: these Goddesses know the deep secrets of all the siddhis. The chakra is called as Sarvarogahara, and the enclosure is called as Aṣhṭār.</font><br>

<font color="red">His sixth form was as the Strong Man (Paraśhurāma). He brought forth the powers achieved by self-control (<i>tapobala</i>). When they were fully evolved human beings developed their `I'-ness and felt a need to seek the unknown within themselves. They began to think about God, and became aware of the strengths of spiritual life, and started a new search of the inner life. The search was an individual one, and the seeker absolutely secluded himself from society. Many renounced the world and went into complete retreat in the forests and jungles in search of the Ultimate Reality, often pursuing their quest day and night for years on end, and often for life after life. Paraśhurāma was the founder of Haṭha and Rāja Yoga which were practiced all alone under the guidance of a guru.</font><br>

<br>
<font color="red">Ādi Śhakti incarnated as Durgā a thousand times to protect such Saints, and apart from these full Incarnations She also manifested Her Powers through many chaste women of India in a partial form (<i>Aṃśhāvatāra</i>). The Incarnation of Ādi Viṣhṇu as Paraśhurāma. (the Strong Man) created an awareness of the techniques of physical and mental powers. Seekers discovered many new methods of meditation through such discoveries. </font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">[Haritāyana:] "Undisturbed you have heard, O Nārada! the Māhātmya (The Gospel) [Māhātmya Khanda or Haritāyana Saṃhitā Section 1] of Śhrī Tripurā, which teaches the way to transcendence."</font>

<p>
<b>1.5-7 Translation</b><br>
<font color="DarkGreen">No other course will impress the mind so much as this one on Wisdom which was once taught by that Illustrious Master Dattātreya to Paraśhurāma. The teaching was born on His own experience, logical in sense and quite unique in its nature. One who cannot apprehend Truth even after hearing this must be dismissed as a silly fool to be ranked among the insentient and accursed of God; Śhiva Himself cannot make such a one gain wisdom.</font>

As Paraśhurāma, the son of Jamadagni, already pure-minded and pleasing to all, was listening to the Gospel [Māhātmya] of Tripurā from the lips of Dattātreya, He became abstracted in devotion and so growing still for a time, His mind became still purer.</font>

<b>1.12-13 Translation</b><br>

</p>

<p>
<b>1.51-52 Translation</b><br>
<font color="DarkGreen">" ...... I too have been unwittingly imitating them like a blind man following the blind. Enough of this folly: I will at once return to that ocean of mercy - my Master."</font>
