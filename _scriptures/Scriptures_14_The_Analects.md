<b>Quotes</b><br>
Now, since long, from ancient times, we have been hearing about the Spirit: that, 'We are the Spirit,' 'We have to become the Spirit.' <font color="red">Whether you take Confucius, or you have Lao Tze, or you have any Indian philosopher, or you may be having any one of the others in the West where Christ has said many a times that, 'We have to be the Spirit.'</font><br>
......<br>
So, first of all forget about your mental processes.<br>
<font color="red">For example, a person who is a very highly person uh realizable Soul, whom Confucius calls as a Superior Man -- He call him a Superior Man, imagine! According to Confucius, a man who is rich, who is well-educated is not superior. He is a primitive person. [Laughing:] Compared to a person who is a developed, evolved personality, according to be superior, all others are primitive people, at a lower level. That's how He describes them: Superior Men. You see, to Him: only the Superior Men can understand humanity.<br>
He talks, because He was of that level, so He talked on that level, on the Superior Man.</font><br>
So the Superior Man, who is within us, who has to manifest itself, is the personality which resides, which has to express itself when we ... our attention reaches that state. Attention has to reach that state and not our mental process and all the yarn that comes out of it.<br>
So, first of all, the thinking has to be stopped.<br>

<br>
<font color="red">For example, now you are walking, and you are blind, supposing. Now I will say, 'All right. You take your first step first.' This is the first step. And He said, "First step was Self-realization." He [Lord Buddha] said, "First you get your Self-realization.<br>
Confucius, on the contrary of that, He said, "All right. Let us start seeing in the communities." You see, He believed in the communities, how it works out in the society, in the people, in the collective. Because He Himself was a realized Soul and He could see that it will work out more on the collective.<br>
But Buddha said, "First you get your Realization." There's no way out.</font><br>

<br>
<font color="red">So you have to feel the capitalism within you, you have to feel the communism within you. <font color="red">You have to feel the humanism of Confucius within you.</font> Whatever has been talked about, the theories, all that we had of a sublime nature, all are to be felt! The sublimity is to be felt within us, giving us joy. Even the virtue, the righteousness, the goodness, the sweetness, has to be felt within us giving us joy! We should enjoy our virtue!</font><br>

<br>
<font color="red">So the ascent of the Kuṇḍalinī is a living process within you, which works out the Self-realization, the Second Birth as Christ has said, as Muhammad Sāhab has said, "You have to be a Walī," as Lao Tze has said, and Confucius has described. We have Nāṇaka and Janaka who have talked about it. That it is within us, and we have to achieve it within ourselves.</font><br>
......<br>
<font color="red">For the first time you start enjoying another person without lust or greed.<br>
Once in Calcutta [Kolkata], I was staying in a hotel, and we had about three, four Sahaja Yogis in another room. And the owner of the hotel came to Me: "Mother, please give me Realization." And when he got his Realization, all of them from their rooms came running! "What has happened, we are feeling so joyous?" I said, "See, the vibrations of this man! Feel the vibrations!" And they stood there, for at least half an hour, enjoying him and he enjoying them. No thought passed. They did not know he was the owner of the hotel, or he ... they ... he did not know who they were, from what part of the country! Pure joy of humanity which Confucius has described. You could feel: real, true friendship of purity.</font><br>

<br>
<font color="red">Like in China, Confucius said that, "You must become very virtuous, righteous," because the Chinese were lethargic farmers, "and you must work," humanism He started. But now they found out that now they are going too much towards it. So Lao Tze came. You see, They had to work it out, because some people move like a pendulum on one side, then They have to move them on the other side. Lao Tze came, He talked about Tao.</font><br>

<br>
<font color="red">Even when Confucius talked of humanism, it was needed at that time when people were lethargic.</font><br>

<br>
<font color="red">They had two great philosophers, but the greatest was Lao Tze, who talked about Kuṇḍalinī, Realization, everything. Confucius talked about humanity. So they believe in Confucius because [it] suits communism.</font><br>

<br>
<font color="red">Confucius first talked about humanity, but then came Tao of Lao Tze who tried to bring the subtle side of humanity.</font> This Tao is something like the Kuṇḍalinī of Sahaja Yoga.

<font color="DarkGreen">The Master said, 'Is it not a pleasure, having learned something, to try it out at due intervals? Is it not a joy to have friends come from afar? Is it not gentlemanly not to take offense when others fail to appreciate your abilities?'</font><br>
<font color="blue">The Master said: "Is it not indeed a pleasure to acquire knowledge and constantly to exercise oneself therein? And is it not delightful to have men of kindred spirit come to one from afar? But is not he a true philosopher who, though he be unrecognized of men, cherishes no resentment?"</font><br>
<font color="Peru">The Master said: To study and at due times practice what one has studied, is this not a pleasure? When friends come from distant places, is this not joy? To remain unsoured when his talents are unrecognized, is this not a junzi [originally 'a prince', used by the Analects to denote an ideal moral actor].</font><br>
<font color="purple">The Master said, "Is it not pleasant to learn with a constant perseverance and application? Is it not delightful to have friends coming from distant quarters? Is he not a man of complete virtue, who
feels no discomposure though men may take no note of him?"</font>
