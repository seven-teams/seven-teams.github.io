<b>Quotes</b><br>

<br>
<font color="red">Like in India, you see, there are sweepers who clean all the bathrooms and things like that, they never get the bad smells, you know. It's like that.<br>
We have lost that sensitivity of chastity within us. And that's how this attention is very much ruined.<br>
So, only thing that we could have done: is to put this attention right.<br>
It was done, say, [with] Judaism.<br>
When Moses came in, He talked of our Ten Commandments. That was the time, I mean thousands of years back! He talked that, 'Let us first of all establish our attention.' That's what He said, 'That's what we have to do.'<br>
Then Christ came. First the attention was to be fixed. I don't know how far He was successful. I've not seen any Jew who has got his attention properly fixed.<br>
So Judaism failed completely. And the Scriptures who came out of the Old Testament to the New Testament are much worse. Because they started thinking that, 'Now, we are very physical. Christ came for us, we are the chosen ones. So, we'll just ask Christ to put attention for us, and we'll do what we like.'<br>
Very nice ideas, you see? That you do not respect your attention at all, you spoil your attention, which was the basis. Which was established thousands of years back, in the Old Testament.</font><br>

<font color="red">Even the Bible that is today, I don't know how far it has been tallying with the real Bible that was written. Because in the New Testament, this, Saint Paul, who has been included, I don't know what right he had to be there! Because he was not with Christ. He killed many Christians himself. And he suddenly saw a cross, so he becomes such a big Christian that he's included in the Bible!<br>
He's creat... created the biggest problem for Christians.<br>
He has taught, that, the uh ... I muhn ... I mean the description of the Acts is all written by him and not by the ... uh-uh-uh ...  disciples of Christ. I mean he added his own stuff in between.<br>
If he sees a cross that means he's a supraconscious person! And if he's a supraconscious person, then how are we to rely on his any information? That he said, that, "When ... uh the Holy Ghost came as Cool Breeze," that's true, but, "that all the disciples started speaking different languages. And they behaved like mad people, and everybody said they were mad."<br>
It's a simple question of getting possessed, that's all! But they never got possessed, His disciples.<br>
And how can they behave like mad people? If there is a Holy Ghost, they must be [the] sanest people going around.</font><br>

<font color="red">Uhm Kuṇḍalinī in Christian terms is called the Holy Spirit, and it's the same energy that's described in the New Testament as a Cool Wind. In Indian Scriptures it's described as the Chaitanya, as Cool Vibrations, and in Muslim's Scripture it is called the Rūḥ, and also at described as Cool Vibrations. And these Cool Vibrations that you feel once you receive the awakening are the vibrations of Absolute Truth. </font><br>

<br>
<font color="red">Like a Five Books of the engine that you have, Torah or the Five Books [of Tanakh], are common to three of them: Christians, Jews and Muslims. So the Muslims accept uh-uh-uh ... the Five Books. And out of that, they accepted the sharia's, that is all in the Bible, whether Jew in in ... or Christian or anyone. And it was, all whatever was said, just to establish with fear the dharma.<br>
But later on, you see, that uh all ... all the other people added their own, like Torah has got additions from the Jews, then the ... uh then the Christians had the New Testament, and the ... then also the Muslims had Qur'ān about Muhammad Sāhab.<br>
But, you see, Muhammad definitely accepted Christ. Only thing they said that Muhammad Sāhab had said that, "I am the last to come here," as the Prophet. He accepted all the Prophets of the world.<br>
But, you see, He ... He must have found out that the world is so wretched [laughs, laughing:] that He's been so much misused so He came back again as Guru Nāṇak.</font><br>

<b>Matthew</b><br>
</p>

<p>
<b>5:29 Verse</b><br>
<font color="DarkGreen">And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</font><br>
<font color="blue">If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.</font>
</p>

<p>
<b>Quote</b><br>
<font color="red">Moreover now, if you take, say, the question of Christianity, in the New Testament, bring it, the fifth chap... chapter of Matthew's, you will find how strict Christ was about people who wanted to be Christians.<br>
......<br>
You can find how Christ was so strict about the Christians, what they should be like, because he must pure themself, so innocent himself, and know [the] Divine. So He said that, "If one eye is doing a wrong thing, you take out your eye." "If your one hand is doing a wrong thing, cut out your hand."</font><br>
