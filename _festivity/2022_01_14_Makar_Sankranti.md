<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is the day where we celebrate the change of the axis of the Sun and that He moves towards the Tropic of Cancer.</b><br> 
<b>Tropic of Cancer is the one which represents the motherhood, the motherhood of the Earth.</b><br>
This Tropic of Cancer has passed through quite a big area of land while the Tropic of Capricorn has not. And the area through which it has passed it has created different beautiful manifestation of the motherhood qualities on this Earth. We celebrate this change because the Sun has now moved into the new dimension so that all over the world there will be the warmth of the Sun.<br>
Warmth of the Sun represents the warmth of God's Love. This is the reason why we celebrate this festival by giving you some sort of a sweet made out of sesame seeds. Sesame seeds are given because they are also heat-giving and now as we are coming from the cold, we come to the hot season in a way, hotter season, so to prepare you with that warmth of the Sun these special things are made out of the seed of sesame to represent the oncoming warmth and the warm of the Sun.

<font color="DarkRed">"Suṣhumṇā nāḍī is the one where one would say is the equator – it’s not, is not the equator, but is the axis of the Mother Earth. Axis of the Mother Earth is the Suṣhumṇā, and that has to act.<br>
...... This axis is the intelligence of the Mother Earth. It is not only the intelligence but it is the fragrance, and apart from, it is the Suṣhumṇā nāḍī, you can say, of the Mother Earth. Now through this axis only all these swayambhus and all these great happenings of earthquakes and all that takes place. This axis is the one which moves. It’s an energy, we can call it axis as the energy, moves the lava into different directions and pierces through different areas to create earthquakes, and also to have ... volcanoes, volcanoes. And all these things happen because the axis has sense what is to be done. This axis is the one that loves us.<br>
Because of this axis we, we have seasons. The seasons are created beautifully to give us different, different varieties of food and varieties of things. The heat of the Mother Earth if it is lost, then we’ll have nothing on this Earth, it’ll be all frozen and there will be all snow, and we’ll have no food, nothing, and it will be like Moon living here. Now it has been specially created: first the Mother Earth when it was created through the heat of the Sun, so we can say that the Sun is the father of the Mother Earth. Then she was brought very close to the Moon so it cooled down, absolutely it cooled down, it was all snow."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"This axis has to be grown. Now when you come for My Pūjā and all that I do expand it, I agree, but it is temporary thing. To retain it at that point one has to work at home, in the collective also. One has to work very much at home with meditation. But it should be done seriously. It should not be just a joke, to be frivolous, to be stupid – that’s not the way. It should be done very seriously, in the meaning that it is a devoted task you have taken, it’s a meditative thing; it’s a prayer to God we can call it, it’s a Pūjā to God. Is to be done with that reverence, because reverence is the key of achievement. If you have no reverence about yourself and no reverence of others, then it cannot be done"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"...... when on the Saṅkrānti, when the day changes, on the fourteenth of January when the Sun changes over, then they give the sweet,[unclear] saying that, ‘We’ll give you the sweet and speak to us in the same way in a sweet manner’ – so friendship. <b>Sugar gives you friendship. You give sweets to people to establish friendship.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"But even here it is regarded as a time today, it's the day that the end of the Saṅkrānt, means the end of the calamity is over. And they give something sweet to eat which is also mixed with sesame seeds, because sesame seed is heat-giving. So today being the coldest day they want to give sesame seed, also want you to retain the heat and to adjust yourself to the heat that's coming up. This is all thought of in a way, in a very gross level, on a very gross level, that we should keep the people warm enough. Also it is said that the warmth of love should be expressed at this time for people, because it is the coldest day. So they say that, "We give you this special thing for you to say something sweet," that is, "Gūḷ gūḷ bola," means: "You say something sweet to us." "</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"To speak in a very sweet manner is a sign of good breeding, good culture and fear of God. Those who fear God will never speak rudely to another person, because in another person also the same Spirit is shining and why should we be sharp or angry with another person who is created by God Almighty as we are created.<br>
So this loving, beautiful relationship that we have with each other, after Sahaja Yoga especially, let us express in talking to each other sweetly. There are so many ways by which we could be sweet. There are little, little things if you do, you can create lot of sweetness, but you need not a sharp tongue, but a sharp memory."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>I am giving you the powers, you can assimilate them.</b> If you just meditate every day it is not sufficient. You have to see what well-being you are giving to the others. But instead of that, you always think about your own well-being and come and ask Me to treat your son, your father, your mother, or ask that you should get a good job. And you want that I should also come to your house to eat, do this, do that. This way, you try to impose your will upon Me but about you, what can you do? You should always remember that you have to do something.<br>
<b>“I will show Śhrī Mātājī what I’m capable of, to do something special.”</b> We should decide this once and for all. I have an image in front of My eyes as Śhrī Gyāneśhwara has said, “Bolte Piyushanche Sagar” [Words or sayings are like the oceans of Nectar]. Where is it? I want to see it.<br>
<b>Thus on this auspicious day, I give you all My sweet blessings that you will help everyone and look after their well-being and you will treat everyone with love and you will talk sweetly, full of love.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"So today is a great day. This saṅkramaṇa that has started requires serious effort.<br>
We cannot play about with that. It’s very great emergency. I can feel in the atmosphere the emergency.<br>
All the Gods and Goddesses are there to help you to work it out. You are in ... on the stage and you have to create that great drama of revolution.<br>
We have to show to this world that it’s only the Spirit that can save the world, nothing else.<br>
And so, from today we start our journey towards that subtlety and that sensitivity, which you can feel,<br>
with which you can feel Nirānanda. Nirānanda, your Mother’s name is Nirā, and at Sahasrāra you feel the ānanda, the joy of Nirā.<br>
May God bless you all."</b></font><br>
