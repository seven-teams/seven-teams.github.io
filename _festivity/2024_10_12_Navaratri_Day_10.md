<font color="DarkRed">"Nine yugas, nine times, you all have been saved properly, and on the tenth month you are given your birth. Also this birth is always after seven days of nine months. So we had to wait for some time till it matures.<br>
<b>Now the tenth Navarātri today is to celebrate actually the Ādi Śhakti. So today we are really going to worship the Ādi Śhakti.</b> On one side the Ādi Śhakti is Mahākālī, on the other side She is Mahāsaraswatī, in the center She is Mahālakṣhmī, and also She is the Ambā, the one who is the Kuṇḍalinī. But She’s also beyond that. She’s Parāśhakti, She’s beyond all the powers because She is the Generator of Power, so She has to be beyond all that.<br>
<b>So today when we are worshiping Her, we have to worship Her in all these forms.</b>"</font><br>

<p style=" text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"So She has created all these things just for you to be created, and ultimately to get your Self-realization; to have meaning for your life, to get connected to this All-pervading Power, to enter into the Kingdom of God. All is Her work.<br>
<b>So we can say nine times She came, and the tenth time She is supposed to give Realization to all of you. But at the tenth time, all these Three Powers are joined together – that’s why it’s called Triguṇātmika.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="Navy"><b>Namo Devyai maha-devyai</b><br>
Salutations to the Devī, to the Mahadevī,<br>
<b>Shivaye satatam namah,</b><br>
To You who is ever Auspicious,<br>
<b>Namah prakrutyai bhadrayai</b><br>
To You who is the Primordial Cause,<br>
<b>Niyutah pranatah sma tam.</b><br>
And the sustaining Power, we bow to You.</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now you enter into the Kingdom of God. Then the Śhakti makes you sit on different beautiful positions, and some are sitting in the Heart of God, some are sitting in the Sahasrāra of God, in the Kingdom of God.</b><br>
Now you should assume your power. On Navarātri now, you should understand that it has now crossed the limit and now we are on the tenth position, where you must assume. I have told you many a times, now believe that you are Sahaja Yogis. Believe that you are, you have entered into the Kingdom of God. You cannot judge God, you cannot say why She does that, why She does that, why He does that. You cannot say that -- that's different. But when you sit there, then it is not an assembly, it is not like a politician fighting, no; it is that you have entered into the Kingdom of God, blessed by God, looked after, protected, nourished, and made knowledgeable.<br>
......<br>
So Navarātri's -- <b>now, the tenth day of Navarātri, which is the most important for all of you, is where this Paramachaitanya has become active. And by its activity you should know it is become very powerful, and that now anybody who tries to be nasty with you, tries to trouble you -- "I don't have to worry at all." It will take care of it.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="Navy"><b>We should devote ourselves to that Devī<br>
Who resides at the center of our lotus hearts,<br>

Who is three-eyed, Who wears red clothes, and<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"It’s very remarkable that, not only that you recognize Me as a Mother who loves you very much, but a Mother who is powerful to protect you. Is very powerful. If you realize that and if you feel that within your heart. Supposing I correct you some time, instead of feeling sad you should see that, ‘How fortunate I am that Ādi Śhakti Herself is correcting me. She’s taking interest in me. How fortunate I am to be born at this time, to be with Her in Her great work. What have I done [to deserve this]?’ <b>This recognition itself will fulfill all the Incarnations of Navarātri.</b>"</font><br>
