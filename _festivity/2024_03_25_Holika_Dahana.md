<font color="DarkRed">"As you know, <b>on the Day of Holī, Holikā was burnt</b>. Agni [God of Fire] had a very big blessing and task, because Agni Devatā had given Holikā a boon that in any circumstance, she will not burn, that death could come to her in any form, but not by fire. And after giving this boon, he regretted a lot because she took Prahlād in her lap and sat in the fire. And Agni Devatā had a big dilemma, that, "I have given this promise to her, that I will not burn her and how can I fulfill this promise? And Prahlād, is Himself innocence personified, He is Himself an Incarnation of Śhrī Gaṇeśha and how can I burn Him? Nobody can burn Him. And He is also beyond my powers. He is formed from my power." So he thought, "What is this ego? that in front of such a Great Power what can I talk about my power? I have no such power which can face Him. His Power is so great that I cannot burn Him whatsoever I may try. But at this time I have a very big dilemma in front of me."<br>
So in between duty and dharma the dilemma is in between these two. In this situation we must understand that dharma is higher than duty. <b>The duty of dharma is higher than a normal duty and even higher is the Dharma of the Ātmā.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, the great day of Holikā Dahana</b>, where the symbolism of this occasion is that the satanic forces were burnt by the innocence of Prahlāda. And that is what we have to remember, that when the Sahaja Yogis take to innocence and complete dependence on to their vibratory awareness, which is the indication of God's Manifestation through them, they are completely protected, and even a satanic person like Holikā could not burn him [them].<br>
And this is the day today, we have to recognize that, as Sahaja Yogis, we stand no dangers in life. We are fearless people, but we are humble people, loving people, and anxious to save as many as possible. To eman... to raise the whole humanity into another awareness, in the process of your evolution you have to achieve ghaṭ, for which you have to work hard."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Holī was started during the time of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.</b> Before Him in the time of Śhrī Rāma ... He was very austere. Because of that the society became very peaceful but people were devoid of all joy. So He thought that there should be a way by which people should be able to laugh freely and be joyful. And like it happens to all such ventures it happened in the case of Holī also that it produced an opposite effect.<br>
......<br>
<b>The story of how it started is like this.</b> There was a demoness called Holikā. She was the sister of Prahlād and Prahlād's father used to trouble him a lot. Holikā had a boon that she would not be burnt by the fire. Prahlād's father wanted to kill him and told Holikā to take the child [Prahlād] and sit on the burning pyre thinking that she would not die. But it is surprising that she died and Prahlād was not hurt in the fire and came out of it unscathed.<br>
This is a very big happening which demonstrated that it is very wrong to be cruel and aggressive. She had the boon but still she got burnt. That's why we have this custom on Holī.<br>
In our country [India] all such things have a lot of truthfulness. We have to understand that if we do wrong things, trouble others ... then these are demonic qualities.<br>
......<br>
We should not have these demonic qualities because we are Sahaja Yogis. We are a special race of people who have taken birth to transform this world and we should pay our attention towards that. We are very highly placed, higher than all others and we have to save all others from such tendencies. These days it has spread a lot. That's why all such hateful, cruel behavior by which we dominate others, torture others is very, very bad and there is no need to do all that in Sahaja Yoga."</font><br>

<font color="blue"><b>"Always with Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's blessings you all should enjoy your Holī. But the greatest Holī is within yourself when you fill yourself with all kinds of colors. Your nature should be such that everybody should enjoy that color. That color that is within you, color of beauty -- not artificial, just showing of, just giving something without any love."</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So, <b>with Holī after dahan</b> [scorching], like I said yesterday, <b>let us decide today, that now Holī will be like Diwālī</b>. The joy of it should be overwhelming. Why the joy of Holī? Although we burn just one Holikā but afterwards, the joy flows in the Collective Consciousness, whether he is a sweeper or a garbage collector or even any other person working in the house. Like in My family, in Lucknow, from where My family belongs, these people are landlords. So the sweeper does not dare to enter inside the house. People don't like them coming even their threshold, to that extent. They reprimanded them.<br>
But <b>on the Day of Holī, any person, whether he is a master or a servant, anybody, they all play Holī together</b>. Even if you tear the clothes of the master then also no one will reprimand you on the Day of Holī. This is the way a social and collective celebration of happiness started in our country."</font><br>
