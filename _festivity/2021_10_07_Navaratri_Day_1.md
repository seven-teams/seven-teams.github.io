<font color="DarkRed">"<b>You are the people who are chosen by God. Specially, first to express your desire, and then to achieve it. And by intense desire of purity, you have to purify the whole world.</b> Not only the seekers but even those who are not seekers. You have to create an aura around this universe, of desire to achieve the Ultimate, the Spirit.<br>
Without desire, this universe would not have been created. This Desire of God is the one that is the Holy Ghost, is this All-pervading Power, is the Kuṇḍalinī within you. Kuṇḍalinī has only one desire, is to be the Spirit and anything else, if you desire, the Kuṇḍalinī doesn’t rise. Only when it knows that this desire is going to be fulfilled by somebody, who is facing the seeker, it is awakened. If you do not have the desire, no one can force you. Sahaja Yogis should never try to force this desire on other people."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"In Sahaja Yoga, Navarātri is the most important Pūjā, I would say.</b><br>
Though we can say in modern Sahaja Yoga Sahasrār Day is, because that’s how you<br>
started getting your Realization. But if you go to the whole historical events of evolution you’ll find Navarātri is the one which has brought you to Sahasrāra.<br>
Without the help of the Devī at different stages<br>
of your ascent, you could not have been in a position to receive your Realization."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Similarly with God Almighty. <b>When He desired to create this nature, He collected a desire, we may say a wave or vibration and filled within a container or Ghaṭ. It is that Ghaṭ. And this Ghaṭ means the God Almighty.</b><br>
If we can separate God Almighty and His power of desire for our understanding, then it will be easy to understand.<br>
You, people, are similar but with a slight difference. You and your desire powers are different. First, the power of your desire is born. Until you have a desire for anything, nothing is executed. This means [that] this beautiful universe is created because of someone’s desire. Everything is executed after a desire. To execute the desire of God Almighty it has to be separated from Him. We will call it Ādi Śhakti.<br>
<b>When this first stage arrived this Ghaṭasthāpanā happened. This happened so many times in ancient times and even today when we have Ghaṭasthāpanā we memorize that aboriginal happening. So on the first day of Navarātri, we do Ghaṭasthāpanā, means, remember, what an important thing it is.</b><br>
Whatever God Almighty desired at that time collected and filled in a Ghat before its execution. Today we are worshiping that desire, we worshiped it today. God Almighty had that desire and brought us up to human being-ness, up to this height stage he brought us, now it is your duty to bow in front of His desire.<br>
<b>In our Sahaja Yoga, this desire is called Śhrī Mahākālī’s Desire or Mahākālī’s Power.</b> This is Mahākālī’s Power and these nine special days of Navarātri are about the incarnations of Śhrī Mahākālī."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Mahākālī Power, first of all, gave birth only to Śhrī Gaṇeśha. Then Śhrī Gaṇeśha was established.</b><br>
Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the Deity established first of all. So is the case of Śhrī Gaṇeśha, like Mahākālī it is the Seed and the whole universe emerged out of it and again get merged into it, similarly, everything emerges out of Gaṇeśha Principle and gets merged into it. Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the seed of whatever is there, you see through your eyes, in creation, in desire. That is why Śhrī Gaṇeśha is considered first among Deities."</font><br>

<font color="DarkSlateBlue"><b>Stuta Sūraih Purvam bhishts Samshrayattatha<br>
Surendrena Dineshu Sevita<br>
Kaotu Sa Nah Shubha Hetur Ishwari<br>
Shubhani Bhadranya Bhihantu Cha Padah</b></font><br>
<font size="-1"><b>Invoked of yore by the Devas for the sake of their desired object,<br>
and adored by the lord of the Devas every day,<br>
may She, the Ishwari, the source of all good, accomplish for us all auspicious things and put an end to our calamities!</b></font>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Now let us see the <b>first chakra, belongs to the Power of Gaurī, the Power of the Mother of Śhrī Gaṇeśh. Gaurī’s Power. Tremendous they are, aren’t they?</b> Because of Her Power you have got your Realization. Now, what have we done to enshrine that power within ourselves? Today, if it is the first day of Navarātri, let us see what have we done? Have we been able to develop our innocence within ourselves?<br>
...... In your childlike nature only, <b>you can receive the blessings of Gaurī, otherwise, you cannot.</b> You have to be really childlike, otherwise, it is absolutely useless, no use telling you anything because you think you’re too clever. To such a person, who thinks he is too clever, what’s the use of talking to such a person, because he already knows everything.<br>
So the first power when you develop, you must learn to sit on the Mother Earth, first of all. You must respect the Mother Earth, because the first chakra is made out of the Mother Earth. Try to be more settled down with yourself on Mother Earth. And the respect. See the trees when they get their flowers, they are not so respectful, but when they are laden by the fruits, they bow down to Mother Earth. In the same way, when you have got the fruits of Sahaja Yoga, you all must bow down.<br>
And innocence has a special capacity to make a person extremely peaceful, extremely peaceful. All the anger, temper, violence. If a person doesn’t have innocence, it cannot come in it, because a person who is not innocent is either sly or aggressive. He cannot have peace within his heart. But a innocent person is not bothered, innocently he lives, he enjoys everything in complete peace and harmony."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"Today on the first day of Navarātri your attention should be on Śhrī Gaṇeśha.</b> His devotion is infinite.<br>
He has never worshiped anybody else except Mother.<br>
Hence He is so great. All other Gods appear very strong. Everyone has some specialty. What is Mother’s specialty? Her ego (aham) is nowhere felt by others.<br>
Hence Śhrī Gaṇeśha who has surrendered to such Mother is so wise and venerable, Mother has nothing with Her.<br>
......<b>You are made in the pattern of Śhrī Gaṇeśha.<br>
Therefore, your power is unmatched, but for that, you should have devotion and innocence like Śhrī Gaṇeśha’s.</b> Then Mother would admire you and the whole world would witness that beautiful sight."</font><br>
