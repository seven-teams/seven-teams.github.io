<font color="DarkRed">"You see all these five elements are very important in our body and they are the body of the chakras also as I have told you. So what happens that, when you sing the music, the vibrations can go through the musical sound and can excite certain chakras. For example, for the Hṛiday [heart] chakra it is very good or also for the Vishuddhi chakra it is very good. Not for all the chakras. But certain chakras it does. But supposing you say a mantra, that’s the sound, with beautiful music and a realized Soul then it is very effective. For example, Gaṇesha you can excite him with a beautiful sloka if you are a realized Soul and if your Gaṇesha is correct, you can excite the Gaṇesha of another person very easily, I mean such a person can do it."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen"><b>Shri Adi Shakti, to describe You is the work of poets and saints, yet words cannot even begin to express Your magnificence.<br>
You are Para-shakti, the power beyond all powers.<br>
Give us, O Shri Adi Shakti, greater humility so that we can gain some small glimpse of Your glory.<br>
Make us like the Sufis and the Gnostics adoring You at every moment.</b></font><br>
