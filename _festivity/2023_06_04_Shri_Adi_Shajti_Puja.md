<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we are going to do the Pūjā of Ādi Śhakti.</b><br>
It's a difficult subject uuh to talk about Ādi Śhakti, because is not easy to understand that Ādi Śhakti is the Power of Sadāśhiva. Sadāśhiva is the God Almighty. She is His breath, as they some people call it. <b>Some say She is the Desire and some say that She's the Entire Power of Sadāśhiva and Sadāśhiva cannot do anything without Her Powers.</b><br>
......<br>
The first thing is, we must know, that She created a Kuṇḍalinī in the Mother Earth Itself and She created Śhrī Gaṇeśha out of the Mother Earth, it's very interesting.<br>
So, the Mother Earth becomes a very important thing for us. If we do not know how to respect the Mother Earth, we do not know how to respect ourselves.<br>
The expression of Ādi Śhakti within you is the Kuṇḍalinī, no doubt. That is the reflection of Ādi Śhakti in you. But the reflection in the Mother Earth is also expressed, as you all know, in different places, different countries, different cities as the manifestation of chakras and Ādi Śhakti's creations. It was very important first to create a very holy Mother Earth for human beings to be born on them [it]. So the reflection of the Ādi Śhakti as Kuṇḍalinī first was on the Mother Earth.<br>
Kuṇḍalinī is a, we should say, is a wee part of the Ādi Śhakti. <b>Or we can say that She is the desire, pure desire of the Ādi Śhakti. So Ādi Śhakti is the desire, complete desire of Sadāśhiva, and Kuṇḍalinī, Ādi Kuṇḍalinī, is the desire, complete desire of Ādi Śhakti.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"Somebody asked Me, uh, "Is it necessary to have this Pūjā?", [laughing:] I think, if there's any Pūjā that you should do, it is this one, is [of] Ādi Śhakti. Is very important that this Pūjā must be performed.</b> Because that is how you grow, this reflection improves, and you grow more and more within yourself, through the Power of Ādi Śhakti or through the power of Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
As you know that: Ādi Śhakti has Her own Kuṇḍalinī, which is the Ādi Kuṇḍalinī, and the reflection of that, within you, is the Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
So you have to worship. And is the best way to please your own Kuṇḍalinī, your own mother, who has given you this birth."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we have gathered here to do the Kuṇḍalinī Pūjā, or the Ādi Śhakti Pūjā.</b><br>
There's a difference between the two: <b>Ādi Śhakti is the Total Power of God, of His Desire, while [Ādi] Kuṇḍalinī is the One that is reflected, part which is reflected in the human beings as Kuṇḍalinī. So there's a difference between the Ādi Kuṇḍalinī and the Ādi Śhakti.<br>
Ādi Śhakti is the Parāśhakti, is the Power which is beyond all the powers, which controls all the powers. And one of the powers of Ādi Śhakti is Kuṇḍalinī.</b><br>
For example, the Kuṇḍalinī which is placed within Me, in the triangular bone, is not [the] totality of Me. In the same way, the Kuṇḍalinī, which is placed within you, is not the totality. Of course, It is the power which is there to give you your Self-realization. Is the power that redeems you, that nourishes you, that enlightens your centers.<br>
But there are two other powers, as you know, very powerful, which are working through Iḍā and Piṅgalā. And the third one is Mahālakṣhmī which is in the center. "</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So, in that reflection that you are Me, in that rekflection [reflection] that the Mother Earth is Me</b>, in that beautiful creation within you, you have to become very sensitive to the need of the world, what is the need of the world. <b>Today, if you fail, the whole thing will fail forever.</b> Only very few will be there. So the need for you is: to spread Sahaja Yoga because this love is not only for you. Is not to be enjoyed [only] by you, but is to be enjoyed by as many possible in the whole world.<br>
<b>So, today we have to decide that, as the children of Ādi Śhakti, we have to go all out, everywhere, every corner, we have to shout and we have to tell loudly what is the time in which we are living and what is the responsibility that you have to fulfill as Sahaja Yogis.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">And at this place meet the three chakras, and that is why Śhrī Mahākālī, Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī and Śhrī Mahāsaraswatī, all these Three Powers meet. <b>As these Three Powers meet, they form One Power, that is Śhrī Ādi Śhakti. That is why in Sahasrāra Śhrī Ādi Śhakti resides, but it is said so, that in Sahasrāra Ādi Śhakti exists in a form of Mahāmāyā -- Śhrī Ādi Śhakti exists, but She is in the form of Mahāmāyā.</b> That is why the result of all these Three Powers was like this, that Śhrī Ādi Śhakti comes into this world in the Form of Mahāmāyā (Mahāmāyā Swarūp), and She can penetrate the Sahasrāra of everyone. As you know, She is in front of you and you know all about it, so I need not tell anything more.</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>This is the first time the Pūjā of the Ādi Śhakti is being done. All the Śhaktis arise from the Ādi Śhakti.</b> And also the Śhaktis of Mahākālī, Mahālakṣhmī, Mahāsaraswatī. All these Śhaktis get absorbed back in her. Only the Ādi Śhakti can do this work, because She has supremacy over all the chakras. She is the one who controls the various permutations and combinations of the chakras, She knows the subtlest of the subtle."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now understand that this Ādi Śhakti is the Power of Love, of Pure Love, of Compassion. There is nothing else She has: only the Pure Love within Her heart. But this Pure Love is so powerful, is so powerful!</b><br>
......<br>
So this Ādi Śhakti's Love is something so, so subtle, is so subtle. You cannot understand sometimes. I know you all love Me very much. It's tremendous love for Me, and when I get the vibrations from you, it is like the ripples that reach the shores and again they return back and lots of little, little sparkling drops are there, on the shore also. In the same way in My heart I feel your love echoing the beauty of this Divine Love ... which I cannot la explain to you the experience that it creates. The first thing that it creates is that tears come into My eyes, because it is the compassion which is Sāndra Karuṇā, is ārdra, it's not dry."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Love is the Message of Ādi Śhakti.<br>
Now you think about it. One Ādi Śhakti created the whole world.</b> How She must have done it. What She must have planned. How She must have organized. It is not a[n] easy thing. Only because She loved.<br>
Love is the expression that you are all there. That is why to be one with Her one should learn to love.<br>
Of course in that you have to know that you should forgive. If you don't know how to forgive and find mistakes of other people you won't help. What is your now job is, is to see that you are loving, no hatred for anyone, you don't think of hating anyone and hitting somebody.<br>
This has to work out."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we are all going to worship Me, first time. It has been always the Pūjā of [an] aspect of Me or a part of Me.</b><br>
Now, one has to know very clearly what is Ādi Śhakti. As we say, is the Pure Desire of God Almighty, of Sadāśhiva. But what is the pure Desire of God Almighty?<br>
If you see your own desires, come out of what? Not out of the Divine Love but out of carnal love, out of material love, of out of power love. Behind all these desires there is love.<br>
If you do not love something you will not desire it. So, these mundane types of love that you have, for which we spend so much of our time uselessly, actually they do not give you satisfaction, because that is not true love that you have. Just infatuation for the time being, and then you just get fed up with it, and from there you jump to another thing, to another thing, to another thing.<br>
So <b>Ādi Śhakti is the Embodiment of God's Divine Love, is God's Pure Love, and in His Love what did He desire? He desired that He should create human beings, who would be very obedient, would be sublime, would be like angels. And that was His idea: to create Adam and Eve.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Pūjā, as I have told you many a times, is not for My benefit, by any chance, take it from Me. I'm much better off without it. Because when the enthusiastic Deities start emitting vibrations with your im... asking. Because you are Saints, so They just, They are overenthusiastic. And They are sitting there, busybodies, you know [soft laughter]. They are sitting quietly waiting for a chance, you see, to emit vibrations, to save you, you see, They want to just rush. They emit so much [laughing:] that They lose, 'Just wait, just wait.' They want to save you, They want to give you, They're so anxious, in Their anxiety to save you. I like it, to see the way They are anxious. But [laughs] ... but you don't suck it and I have a problem there. Once They've given They don't want to take it back. You don't suck it, so it has to go to the atmosphere, it has to disappear somewhere. Is directed towards you and you don't take it, so where does it go? It hangs into My tissues, it pains Me.<br>
So, sucking should be more. Sucking should be more. <b>And just before the Pūjā you should say: 'Mother, make me such that I suck more of the Divine!' Just pray that, with sincerity from your heart, just say that.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Pūjya Mahārāj [Gaganagirị̄ Mahārāj] used to say to Me that, <b>"You are [the] Goddess and [the] Goddess likes the praise [Stutipriyā]. So without praising [the] Goddess one cannot achieve anything."</b> But I see that without properly inviting Deities chakras never work. And these Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, and Maheśh they never listen to [if not properly invited]. Even until you all human beings accept Me [as Śhrī Ādi Śhakti], Śhrī Gaṇeśha, Christ, Hanumāna or Bhairavnāth, no one gets awakened, too. Then every time I have to request Them all [to get awakened].
