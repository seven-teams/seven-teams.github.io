<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is a great day, for all of us, because we are celebrating the Guru Pūjā and remembering all the Great Gurus who came on Earth to teach the world about the Truth. So many of Them were here. And They tried Their level best to explain to humanity what is spirituality.</b><br>
But is such a disparity that people never understood that spirituality is the most important thing we need, that we have to be one with the Divine Power."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is the day peoples, this is created by human beings and not by God, as Guru Pūrṇimā. Because as God has created days of [{\bf{\textcolor{amber+}{unclear}}} their advent], human beings have created days of their surrendering.</b> So this is the day when you have to give something to the Guru. And Guru does not have to give anything to you. This is the time you have to say what you are going to give, what you are going to do for your Guru. Because so far the Guru has been giving. If you are in meditation supposing you say we'll meditate because Guru Pūrṇimā is there. That's not the way the Guru Pūrṇimā is to be celebrated, because if you meditate you are taking from Me. If you try to correct yourself you are taking from Me. If you are going to get cured you are taking from Me. So now what can you do for Me? Is the point you have to think about. What can you do? Now I have sent the same question to India, [{\bf{\textcolor{amber+}{unclear}}}] I asked them to find out what can you do for Me. You will say: `Mother, what can we do? After all, what are we?' That's a way of evading the issue. But if you really want to see, <b>you can do a lot and that is what it is that you are My witness. You are My publicity.</b><br>
So today you have to take some vows. And you have to say that we are going to do these things. We are going to talk about Sahaja Yoga, we are going to propagate it, we are going to spread it and what may come we are going to surrender ourselves to Mother even if She's, supposing, scolds us, or says anything it is for our own good and we are not going to get confused. And that's how you have to <b>absolutely vow that you are going to dedicate yourself to Sahaja Yoga to help others, to emancipate and to create atmosphere for the completion of this universe, of this creation for that [{\bf{\textcolor{amber+}{unclear}}} full, full] day when you will say that the Kingdom of God has been brought on this earth. So today is not the day for Me to give, but for you. You have to announce.</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is the day of Guru Pūrṇimā. It is a Full Moon Day. That's why ... it is called as Pūrṇimā. The guru has to be like a Full Moon. Means completely grown, completely matured.</b><br>
There are sixteen kalās or the phases of the Moon, and when the complete Pūrṇimā comes in, the Full Moon Day, all the sixteen kalās are completed. You also know that in the Viśhuddhi chakra there are sixteen sub-plexuses. When Kṛiṣhṇa is described as Virāṭa, He's called as the Sampūrṇa, the Complete Incarnation of Viṣhṇu's aspect, because He's got the sixteen phases completely done.<br>
So today's number is sixteen. Six plus one: seven.<br>
Now we have to understand the importance of guru. <b>Why should we have a guru when we have God?</b> We've got Śhakti, then why should we have a guru? <b>What is the need to have a guru?</b><br>
Guru means the weight, the weight. We get our weight from the magnetic forces of the gravity of the Mother Earth. So, guru means gravity: the gravity in a person.<br>
<b>Why do we need a guru?</b><br>
Because to know God is easy, specially in Sahaja Yoga, to be one with Him. As soon as you get your Self-realization in Sahaja Yoga, the modern Sahaja Yoga, immediately you become entitled to give Realizations to other people.<br>
It was said that, ``Guru is the person who makes you meet the Divine." But's not true. Because any self-realized person, in the Sahaja Yoga, can raise the Kuṇḍalinī and king ... can give Self-realization to others, immediately after they have touched the Sahasrāra or opened the Sahasrāra. But normally a realized Soul cannot do it. Any born realized Soul cannot do it on its own: it has to have authority of Me, as I am today.<br>
That's why it was said that, ``Guru is a person who makes you meet God": he raises the Kuṇḍalinī and makes you one with God."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"In the Guru Principle, we have seen people who came on this Earth. They were all mostly born realized, actually, and they never gave Realization to anyone to -- very big difference. They were all born as realized Souls, and they became as Sufis and they are called by different names, but they were not given Self-realization, they had it.<br>
And because of their Self-realization, as they had, they have so much of knowledge. And that is what they tried to impart to people.<br>
They knew all about chakras everything they knew, somehow, must be in their last lives achievements that they knew it, perhaps some of them were disciples of other very great people."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Sahaja Yoga is very different from all other gurus that we believe in the Power of Love. Power of Love teaches you how to be forgiving, it makes you noble, it makes you very balanced.</b><br>
So, the gurus who were there for Bhavasāgara, to establish dharma in the human beings, first thing, they had to balance themselves against all practical things, as they call it. They think is not practical! But they said, ``No! For us, this is higher, nobler and important." <b>So they would balance people because they had this Power of Love within themselves. All these Ādi Gurus and Their Incarnations, if you see Them, They always had balance and always prayed ... praised the Love of God.</b>"</font><br>

You too have to bring them around. Might be that they may get annoyed with you, hit you, beat you, they may not remain, but this is nothing. I have borne much more than this. That is why with joy and not arguments; they may not believe in you, doesn't matter. Leave them. They may argue, just leave them. The ones who believe in you give them.
