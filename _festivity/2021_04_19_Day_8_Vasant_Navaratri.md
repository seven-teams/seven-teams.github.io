<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we have gathered here to worship the Ādi Kuṇḍalinī and your own Kuṇḍalinī, both of them because your Kuṇḍalinī is the reflection of the Ādi Kuṇḍalinī.</b> We have understood a lot about Kuṇḍalinī and also we know that through Her awakening only, through Her ascent only, we have ascended into a very higher realm of consciousness. It’s not only that we have risen to a very higher realm of awareness but that it has granted us so many powers that, never before in the history of spirituality people had this power of awakening of Kuṇḍalinī."</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"...... the power of Kuṇḍalinī is Absolute Purity, auspiciousness, holiness, chastity, self-respect, pure love, detachment, concern, enlightened attention – to give you joy. As every mother wants that her child should get the joy. Whichever way is possible, She’ll try to give joy to Her children. In the same way, <b>this Kuṇḍalinī has only one power – how to give joy to Her own children, 
and She does that</b>."</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>First of all, I think this is the most important thing to understand about your own Kuṇḍalinī, as Self-realization is Self-knowledge. And the one who gives you Self-knowledge is this, your own Kuṇḍalinī</b>, because when She rises She points it out what are the problems on your chakras. Now, we say that it is pure desire, but we do not know what purity means. It means your chaste desire. It means it has no lust, greed, anything in it. That power is your own mother and is settled in your triangular bone. She’s your own mother. She knows everything about you, it’s like a tape recorder. She knows everything about you and She is absolutely the knowledge – because She’s so pure. And whatever chakras She touches, She also knows what’s wrong with that chakra – beforehand. So She’s quite prepared, and She adjusts Herself fully so that you do not get a problem by Her awakening. If any chakra is constricted, She waits and goes on slowly opening that chakra. Now, this Kuṇḍalinī is the Primordial Power which is reflected within you. And within you, in a human being it is like many strands of energy. So it’s like a rope and these energies are all twisted together to form this Kuṇḍalinī. In a human being these strands are three into seven – that is twenty-one – raised to power 108. But when your Kuṇḍalinī rises, one or two strands out of this come up and pierce the fontanel bone area – only one or two. Because it has to pass through the innermost nāḍī, known as Brahma nāḍī. It’s all a spiral throughout because Kuṇḍalinī is a spiral and these nāḍīs are also – are like a spiral like this. So the innermost nāḍī is the Brahma nāḍī. The outermost nāḍī is the right side and the second innermost is the Iḍā nāḍī."</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"So the power of Kuṇḍalinī, which is your own mother, which has to rise, which has to come up, which has to manifest itself, because of your pure desire. <b>So in your introspection, in your Pūjās, in your meditation, if you see for yourself why are you meditating – it is for pure desire of compassion and love to be awakened within us.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">Can you feel the cool wind blow, how it flows and it flows,<br>
There's a silence in my heart, it grows and it grows<br>
See the light shine within, a beam of love so pure<br>
You may say it's all a dream, but we can show it's true<br>
Yes we can show it's true</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Collectivity doesn’t mean that we all should be stuck together</b> with some glue or something or we all become like Gibraltar, Rock of Gibraltar. No, it doesn’t mean that. It means wherever you are, you are connected. That is collectivity. Connected doesn’t mean that you hate that person. No, you’re connected means you love that person, you’re concerned about that person. The connection, the connecting line is of love and not of hatred. So, when you are connected with another person, or persons, then you are in collectivity."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>You cannot enjoy Sahaja Yoga without collectivity! You cannot enjoy!</b> Whether there are two persons or many persons. Only you have to understand the collectivity. This is a compulsion on Sahaja Yogis! And I said you don’t have to go to Himalayas, don’t have to do anything. Because the Kuṇḍalinī now has awakened you. It is awakened and it has become one with the Whole. And this Whole has to be pleased with us! And this Whole is being reflected within our heart like the Spirit. This Whole is the Kuṇḍalinī, this Whole is the Spirit. How can we get out of it! So now forget about whatever I have said it! Except remember one thing, we all have to be collective, that’s the only way you can rise. Collective is the one system of the Divine, which is [a] blessing to us, because Kuṇḍalinī can only rise if you are collective, otherwise, It will not! If your attention is on yourself, it won’t! Which I will be telling you now later on, in Sydney, why is it the Bodhisattva Principle has to work out. Just for the time being, I think, we should now understand now that we are praying to our Mother Kuṇḍalinī. She is the One Who has given us everything! She is the One Who has given us our Spirit, She is the One Who has given us all the health, wealth, and prosperity, She is the One Who has given us the spiritual life and the joy of it! We have to be very thankful to Her!"</font><br>
