<font color="DarkRed">"Music is so much appreciated. I think there is nothing in this so-called modern music, but it's the rhythm with which they capture the heart. And the rhythm is anahat, the force is anahat, is the heartbeat. Heartbeat is the beating of the vani. It's the beating of the force within you which makes the sound, and that's why beats are very important."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Even at My Feet, people keep thinking. I am surprised, at least leave thoughts [questions] when you are at My Feet. But the thoughts are still there.<br> 
I am trying, moving My hands, legs, trying to improve your state, Tāṇḍava Nṛitya [Dance of Destruction, to destroy-negativity] is happening but people are still with thoughts.<br>
At least you should learn to leave thoughts at My Feet and then slowly you will get this habit of getting into thoughtlessness.<br>
No matter what questions you have, just stay in thoughtlessness."</font><br>

<font color="IndianRed">"Normally, if ten people are singing, without proper training, then this are in alto, tenor, bass, everything, they go on. And you don’t know on what swar (note) they have taken, on what note they are singing. But they were yesterday very amazed that all of you were singing on the same note. You wouldn’t leave the note and come onto another note. That shows that the rhythm of Shri Ganesha is working in you and His understanding of music, which is one of His qualities is that He dances on the music of which Nataraja, the father Shiva has taught Him. It’s very rhythmic."</font><br>

<font color="DarkSlateBlue">"...... the Power of Śhiva takes the seeker to the State of Joy. The seeker does the bhakti of Śhiva, to have this Bliss of Joy. But I have seen that most of the Śhivabhaktas are short tempered type. No one could talk to them, what is the use?<br>
