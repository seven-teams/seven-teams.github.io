<font color="DarkRed">"Firstly most of them were poets and this, we had Kabir in India, we don’t know how he was born, where he was from, who were his parents, it’s absolutely not known, despite that you can only make out from their poetry that he was the great Sahaj Yogi, and how he have described things very interesting. He brought forth so many fundamental truths in his poetry and he talked about it."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen"><b>Sometimes by mistake something as you want is not done. You must accept it as the Will of God. That is what He desires. It’s all right.</b><br>
That is the Desire of God and now you are one with His Desire. You are here to communicate the Desire of God to the whole world. At in, at this stage, if you start having your own desires and ideas about yourself, then when will you become the Desire of God?<br>
This ‘I’-ness has to go away. That is what meditation is, where you are no more ‘I’ but it is ‘You’.<br>
Kabīr Dāsjī has written a beautiful poem about it that, "When the goat is living and kicking, she says, 'Maiṃ, maiṃ,' " that is "I, I." "But then she dies and her intestines are drawn out into wires and some Saint fixes them on the tutari," that instrument that they have, ektāri as they call it, "and he goes on pulling it with his fingers, then it says, 'Tū hī, Tū hī, Tū hī,' " that is, "You are, You are, You are." That is how we have to die and we have to be resurrected."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">Śhrī Mātājī quotes from dohas of Śhrī Kabīr:<br>
<b>"Ek hī [ḍhaī] akṣhar prema kā padhe so paṇḍita hoye”</b>;<br>
this is our Sahaja Yoga.<br>
There is no need for you to become a great pundit [intellectual].<br>
<b>"Padhī, padhī paṇḍit mūrkha bhaye"</b>; with too much of reading, an intellectual [paṇḍit] becomes a fool [mūrkha].<br>
Therefore, may God save from the Pundits, may God rescue us from those paṇḍits [intellectuals] who have come here after a lot of reading and studies.” ......</font><br>

Sahaja Yogi: Śhrī Mātājī, how can we develop that same heart that poets like Kabīr have for You?<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b> Why not? See the handicap of Kabīr. You have no handicaps. <b>Kabīr had no Mother to tell Him, no Mother to love Him, look after Him and tell Him all these things.</b> He had a Guru, and you know Kabīr’s life. Kabīr wanted to become the disciple of Rāmānanda Swāmī, but He was a Muslim or low caste or whatever it is, so He could not reach Rāmānand Swāmī. The disciples would not allow Him to go near Rāmānand Swāmī. So one day Kabīra went and slept on the steps of the River Ganges, all night in the cold waiting for Rāmānand Swāmī to come, because He used to always pass the same way. And His Feet fell on Kabīra and He said, “Oh My child, what are you doing here?”<br>
So Kabīra got up and He said, “Sir, You have accepted Me as Your disciple today.”<br>
He said, “Yes, I have.” And then Rāmānand Swāmī took Him and He trained Him into something great.<br>
You don’t have these handicaps, where Kabīra never had anybody to support him or help him around. Actually single-handed he fought the whole world. Horrible people were around him; even today those who are in his place in Patna or in all places where he lived – I was surprised that He described Kuṇḍalinī as ‘Surati’ and they described tobacco as ‘surati’. Such horrible nonsensical people, making fun of everything.,br>
There Kabīra lived and developed that heart. You don’t have all these handicaps at all. You all speak the same language, you live with the same ideas, you have your own Mother to tell you everything, so <b>you can develop the same heart as Kabīra had</b>.</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Kabira has described, <b>"Shunya shikhar par anahad baaje."</b><br>
On the silent apex there is the percussion of Anahata.<br>
Anahat is this “lub-dub” of the heart you feel there.<br>
And then when it breaks you start getting the cool breeze coming out of your head."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"We ourselves, you see, prove that our religion is weak because we have not known the person who brought this religion on this Earth. We have done no justice to them because we have not found our Spirit. If we find our Spirit then we have done full justice to them, because we become a different person, we our self become a Saint. <b>We become people of authority like Kabīra: how he sings, how he talks!</b><br>
Today only I recited him a beautiful couplet that, <b>"Mana mamatā ko thirakarā lau."" He says there, "Of compassion of my heart I make it vibrate," "tharakarā lau." "Pañcha hi tattwa chadhaunga ka." "In all the five elements I’ll put it."</b> Just look at the authority with which he talked! And while these Sanskrit ‘paṇḍitas’ are calling Him ‘Sadhukaddi’, this that, all sorts of things. They cannot understand. For them he is just a man of the ordinary street you see."</font><br>
