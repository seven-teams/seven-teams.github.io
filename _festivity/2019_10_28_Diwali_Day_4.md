<font color="DarkRed">"Now, why is it necessary to have a New Year Day in our life?
While last year those who got Realization were very lucky people, but plodding through the path of Self-realization one loses all the enthusiasm and idealism that one has when you get Realization.<br>
You think of doing so many things about it. When you get Realization you are so much engrossed into it, you enjoy it so much that you think that, ‘Now! The time has come for me to do this and that and that, and I’m going to contact these people and I’m going to give this to news to this one, and I’m going to do this work and show to Mother that what She has given me, I have made it many folds.’ Because it was a new experience, great experience, the only experience that you have been waiting for. And that you also decide that, ‘I am going to now become the torchbearer of this great light that has come into me, and I am going to form one of the lights of this Dīpawali.’<br>
Dīpawali, dīp means these lights, āwali means the row of lights. ‘So I am going to be one of them. And we are going to enlighten the path of the people who want to have Self-realization.’ All these great ideas come to us when we touch our depths. And we feel responsible for all the rest of the humanity."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"It’s the day of Mahālakṣhmī Pūjā night, not only of Lakṣhmī Pūjā; there’s a difference between the two. Mahālakṣhmī is one of the powers of the Three Powers, Main Powers of Ādi Śhakti. As you know: Mahālakṣhmī, Mahāsaraswatī, Mahākālī. Now, these powers have powers at a material level also, at a subtler level also. <b>So Mahālakṣhmī Power is achieved after Lakṣhmī Power.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Then the day of the New Year comes in afterwards, because in India in the north, that’s the time people finish their crops and they found that day was very good to celebrate the New Year. And, that is actually more, sort of, we can say is a social thing in India, we need not use that, whatever suits us. You can have your own New Year. Because in the south, say in Maharashtra they have another New Year, as I told you where Śhālivāhana in his dynasty started another calendar and they celebrate that.<br>
So all these things are nothing is rigid about anything, one must know. Nothing is rigid. Rigidity comes from ignorance. It’s all for you, for your joy and happiness. The whole festival system is for your happiness and not for the happiness of the time or date. It’s for you, so it should be adjustable according to your needs and understanding. And also according to your national way you live. They should be no addiction to any particular type of culture, a particular type of ideas. It’s all for you. All these festivals are for you, not for Gods. They don’t have these festivals. It’s only for you people these festivals are there.<br>
And when you celebrate them, that’s only for your joy and your happiness. And that’s how you should celebrate in a way that gives you the greatest amount of happiness. And the festivals, all the festivals of the world must be celebrated. The more you are festive, the happier it is."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"...... the Mahālakṣhmī Principle is the principle where you start seeking the Truth and nothing else.<br>
But how can you seek the Truth without any light in your hand? It’s not some sort of an abstract thing or just a drama. ‘Oh, I’m seeking the truth with my eyes closed and with darkness in my hand, I’m seeking the truth!’ How can you take to Mahālakṣhmī Principle unless and until the Lakṣhmī Principle is embedded in you? Unless and until you feel that love for each other, you have felt that love, you have expressed that love, you have been generous, you have been enjoying the generosity of your own. Then only you can rise up to that Principle of Mahālakṣhmī which is the Spiritual Principle."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So we have now three Principles of Mahālakṣhmī that we have seen. And the fourth one is Myself. Mine is a much deeper work, much wider and tremendous patience is needed. It won’t work out if I sacrifice anyone. I have to sacrifice Myself. I have to sacrifice My family, so-called. I have to sacrifice My sleep, sacrifice comforts, everything possible under the sun. I have to sacrifice for one reason that, your Mahālakṣhmī Tattwa should be manifested. It should have its fruits.<br>
So you came to Sahaja Yoga as the Seekers of Truth, blessed by Mahālakṣhmī Principle already and if that is so, let us feel it. ‘We love our Mother.’ Why? Why do we love? Why do we love Her? ‘Because She loves us.’
..I bless you with all the Lakṣhmī Principle and Mahālakṣhmī Principle but above all
the Principle of Love, the Pure Love without any expectations, nirvajya. I bless you all on this auspicious day. May God bless you! Have wisdom and understand that Mother has said it out of Her heart, out of Her Love, out of Her feelings for us.<br>
May God bless you!"</font><br>
