<font color="DarkRed">"Today is a very important day for all of us Sahaja Yogis, because today Śhrī Gaṇeśha was born. Śhrī Gaṇeśha is whom we worship and because of whom we got our Realization. However much you may remember Him, until you do not know His special qualities, you cannot attain Him. His special quality is that He is the Embodiment of Purity (Śhuddha Swarūp) and Complete Master of the Universe. He is the Incarnation of the Supreme, of Brahman."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the elder brother of all the Sahaja Yogis because He was created as the first Son of Ādi Śhakti. <b>He is the basic pattern of Her children who get their Rebirth in the Kali Yuga and are known as Sahaja Yogis.</b> It is done by ‘causeless cause’ (saṅkalpa) by which She creates powerful personalities with Self-knowledge. In His evolved human form as the Lord Jesus Christ He fills the role as ‘Chancellor of the University of Sahaja Yoga’. He is responsible for judging each seeker’s suitability for enrollment, and gives His permission for them to register in His Divine University. After passing them through the four levels of the Swādhiṣhṭhān, Nābhī, Anāhata and Viśhuddhi chakras, as Chancellor, He awards each seeker with a degree. At this point the seeker has risen to the awakened stage.<br>
After crossing the Āgñyā chakra, the attention of the seeker enters the limbic area of the brain called the Sahasrāra. When the fontanel bone at the top of the head is pierced, and Yoga is effected, He bestows the postgraduate degree on each seeker. This is Self-realization. After the entry into the Unconscious Mind has been achieved, the higher degrees also have to be authenticated by Śhrī Gaṇeśha. Although the post-graduation ceremony is granted by Ādi Śhakti Herself, nevertheless Śhrī Gaṇeśha has to bless  each graduate."</font><br>

<font color="green">"Today is [an] auspicious day, especially since it is Vināyaka Chaturthī [fourth day of a Moon fortnight]. It is [a] very beautiful day.<br>
It is mentioned in the almanac [calendar] that today is the day of special Yoga, i.e., coincidence, and so it is an excellent occasion when we have started such auspicious work."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"As human beings are created in the image of God as Primordial Being (Virāṭa), this center is also expressed first at birth in every human being. The Mūlādhāra chakra is placed in the lowest region of the human trunk about one inch above the center of the ‘seat’. This most vital and important center exists in subtle form. Its gross expression, in medical terminology, is the pelvic plexus which surrounds it.<br>
It is said that God made the creation in seven days. Monday is the day of Ādi Śhakti, and also of Lord Śhiva. Tuesday is the day realized Souls (Sahaja Yogis) should worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha in the Mūlādhāra chakra. Hanumāna, who controls the preconscious mind (chetan mana), should also be worshiped on Tuesday.<br>
Śhrī Gaṇeśha was created out of the earth element. His manifestation differs from soul to soul depending on their state of evolution:"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Now the humility is the main thing one has to understand. And you’ll be surprised, the humility is called as vinay, which is the quality of Śhrī Gaṇeśha – Vināyaka. “Vidyā vinayen[a] śhobhate.” ‘Vidyā’ means “The knowledge is only decorated with humility.” So the humility you saw yesterday of these great artists, and the great gurus who were there. And the guru invited Me to his academy, and he made all kinds of offerings as they would do to a Goddess. I was so much touched, the ready acceptance of Me and of Sahaja Yoga."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen"><b>"In Sahaj Yoga your Gaṇeśha’s Power gets awakened because of Kuṇḍalinī. The first thing which comes is wisdom. We call it Vināyaka [Gaṇeśha]. He only gives wisdom to everyone."</b></font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"He is omnipotent, omnipresent and in everything, but you cannot recognize Him until you are realized. After your Realization you can recognize what Śhrī Gaṇeśha is. Śhrī Gaṇeśha is purity, the Pure Spirit.<br>
When He is awakened within us, then we have no questions left. Then we are successful, in whichever task we undertake. We find joy in everything we do. He is the Embodiment of Joy and gives joy to everyone.<br>
To serve Him is the Paramadharma [Ultimate Dharma]. To serve Him means to look after small children, to serve them, to make sure there is no cruelty towards them. This pleases Him very much. Such an Embodiment of Love, such a pure-hearted Śhrī Gaṇeśha was born today.<br>
This is the importance of this day. Today if you ask for any wish, then Śhrī Gaṇeśha will fulfill it. It is His right to fulfill all your desires, because you are all realized. Ask Him with all your heart and He will help you in every way, every moment, every instant."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"Now there is a thing called Saṅkalp.
Means that you have now say, why do you want to do the Pūjā of Śhrī Gaṇeśha. It’s called Saṅkalp. At this time you have to say this, that, <b>‘I do worshiping Śhrī Gaṇeśha for developing Sahaja Yoga and for working out Sahaja Yoga within myself, with all my friends, with all my relations, with all my country men, with all the world.’</b> 
It’s like that."</font><br>
