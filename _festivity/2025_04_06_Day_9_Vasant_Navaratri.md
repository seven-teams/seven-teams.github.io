<font color="DarkRed">"Śhrī Rāma came on this Earth to establish the institution of benevolent king. The political development and the political evolution started from this [right] side. He is the one who gave leadership as a benevolent king, the one who represents God and who is a king. The idea of a king related to God came from Śhrī Rāma.<br>
But the modern kings are not like that, they have no relation with God. On the contrary, they are horrid people. Some of them are nothing but satanic people, absolutely Satan is there and you can see from the way they lead their lives, and they have led their life before. So the benevolence of Śhrī Rāma is here [shows the right Heart] to be followed by all the political leaders and all the people who are at the helm of affairs. He is the ideal that was created for human beings, to run their authority as the head, or the loving compassionate benevolent leader of the people, who has to govern them by making them respectful, by respect. And if human beings create such things who are not respectable, those who have no human values, those who have no moral courage, those who are selfish, those who are self-centered, then they have nothing to do to be there.<br>
So this is the position of Rāma who is the Father. So the head of every state has to be the father of his subjects, that's what He has tried to show by His life. So much so that He had to sacrifice His beloved Wife, whom He loved so much."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>We have gathered here on the occasion of Rām Navamī.</b> Everybody has said, "Mother please tell us about Śhrī Rām."<br>
You know that Śhrī Rāma has a very important place on our chakra, He is situated on our right Heart. Śhrī Rāma has taken the place of father, hence if there is lack in the responsibility or love from father this chakra is caught.<br>
In Sahaja Yoga we too understand that Śhrī Rāma and all other Deities have taken the form to fulfill Their divine work, in all Śhrī Rāma had a special task. As it was said by Socrates that the Benevolent King has to come the same way Śhrī Rāma had come on this Earth as benevolent king, He came in the form of human being, He even forgot that He was Incarnation of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, forgot about Him but for all world He was Puruṣhottama Rāma.<br>
<b>In Sahaja Yoga we need to know when we pray any Deity, we have imbibed the specialties and qualities of the particular Deity within us, Śhrī Rāma had many qualities.</b><br>
You all know his childhood life and you have already heard about his qualities, he was Puruṣhottama he had another quality that in his ruling, he did not care for his wife or children's in front of his subjects view."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>Then, He had the capacity to kill a demon with only one arrow. It's called as Eka-bāṇi. One arrow was sufficient of Śhrī Rāma. </b></font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">Sāsi-tūna-dhanur-bāna-pānim nak-tan-charāntakam</font><br>
He has a sword in one hand and a bow and arrow in the other and spare arrows in His quiver to kill the rākṣhasas. <br>
<font color="DarkGreen">Sva-līlayā jagatrātum-āvir-bhūtam-ajam Vibhum </font><br>
He is beyond birth and death, His powers have no limits and through His own divine play (līlā),<br>
He has incarnated to destroy all the negative forces and to protect this world.   
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Today is Rām Navamī. I should say it was not started, we should say, but it was very much in vogue when Rāma lived and they used to do Yagñyas at that time. The reason was, that the people had just started realizing that, "There is something higher and you have to worship that higher Self," the Seers said, and they thought that the best thing is to do Yagñyas. The same thing.<br>
On the left side, of course, the people started the worship of God and the dedication to God and all those things. That is bhakti. But mainly what they did before Rāma was the Yagñyas, the Vedas, with which they prayed to different elements. Elements have made our chakras, and they tried to evoke the Deities of the Elements. But actually it amounts to the same [thing].<br>
So, as a child, Rāma was studying with a very great Saint, and when he was studying with him, Vasiṣhṭha was the name of the great Saint. And Vasiṣhṭha had an āśhram where Rāma and His brothers studied."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"But the story of Rāma they say was written before He was born. Even before there was any inkling of it, the Seer, Vālmīki, wrote the whole story of Śhrī Rāma.<br>
<b>Śhrī Rāma's birth and all that are brought forth by the Agni, the fire, and He was born in the Dynasty of the Sūrya, is the Sun. So, with all that, with born out of the blessings of the Agni, that is fire, and also was born in the dynasty of Sūrya</b>, He was one of the mildest Avatāras you have ever had. He's known to be a very -- something for, I mean English language -- formal person, in the sense [laughter, laughs], saṅkoch, that He He would go to any extent to bear upon Himself the problems than to tell others to do something.

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="Blue">[Later on Śhrī Mātājī revealed that the most important thing about Śhrī Rāma's life was 'puruṣhārth' -- the will to rise above all difficulties in life and adhere to one's duties.]</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"In Sahaja Yoga when we worship any God, what quality we gain from them, which qualities we will receive? Śhrī Rāma has many. One that He was ideal, another that He is a king. He kept His people higher than Himself, than his wife and children. If politicians today understand this point, they wouldn't be called selfish, they wouldn't be selfish, would be follower of dharma.<br>
Nobody has followed Śhrī Rāma as a role model till today. By singing His bhajans or building institutions and temples in His name, does Śhrī Rāma come to you? Do you get His light in your life? Only a Sahaja Yogi can bring the light of Śhrī Rāma into the attention."</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So we have to create out of Sahaja Yogis great politicians. It has been predicted [in the Nāḍi Granth] that if Sahaja Yoga does not spread then the third world war is inevitable. People will suffer a lot with a third world war. It is possible to avoid it if people take to Sahaja Yoga in a big number. But if they do not, there will be a third world war and the effects of that will harm people so much that ultimately it is the Sahaja Yogis who will be called for a conference and not the diplomats. The Sahaja Yogis will be consulted, and they will decide what is to be done for the world and they will become the rulers of tomorrow's world. So we must have a full idea [of] how to be rulers like Śhrī Rāma.<br>
We have to go too far with ourselves, to training up ourselves, educating ourselves, getting rid of our egos and understanding that we have to grow."</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"Today I said that Śhrī Rāma was born at twelve o'clock hence the Pūjā should be at time as such it is not long Pūjā but we have to understand that the human form within us in form of humanity in which we understand and make changes in our mind, curiosity and thoughts.<br>
Through the medium of Śhrī Rāma can bring change in our thoughts, he can bring change in our behavior because he is ideal for us, reaching this ideal we can reach other ideals since he is ideal of human being.<br>
<b>This is big thing that the God Himself came on this Earth and become ideal.<br>
We don't leave our dharma, Vishwa Nirmala Dharma, even if we have lot of difficulties.</b><br>
May God bless you."</font><br>
