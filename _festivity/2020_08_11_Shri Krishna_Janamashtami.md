<font color="DarkGreen">"Now we have to realize that Sahaja Yoga has spread a lot and in all corners of the world people respect Sahaja Yoga, but until and unless Sahaja Yoga is completely manifested within us, the people who respect Sahaja Yoga will not continue to do so. That is why it is essential that we look inside of us. The nature of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa is that we look inside of us and see what are the things that put us in trouble. We should find that out. We should look towards ourselves, within ourselves and that is not such a difficult thing."</font><br>

<font color="blue"><b>O Divine Mother, You are verily Śhrī Rādhā-Kṛiṣhṇa. Salutations to You! </b></font>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Now, as you know that United States or America, the whole of it, is the Viśhuddhi chakra. Out of which, we have three sides to the Viśhuddhi chakra. <b>So the central part of the Viśhuddhi chakra is United States.<br>
The central part of the Viśhuddhi chakra is governed by Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. And His Power is Rādhā.</b> Rādhā. ‘Rā’ means energy, ‘dhā’ is the one who has sustained the energy. ‘Rā-dhā’. “Dhārayati [yena] sa [dharmaḥ]” [related to Mahābhārata 12.110.11]. So, she’s the one who has sustained the energy, and so, she’s called as Rādhā. She’s the Power of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br>
The word Kṛiṣhṇa comes from the word – kṛiṣhi, means – the plowing, or you can say, agriculture is called as ‘kṛiṣhi’. The one who plows and puts the seed in the soil, is doing the kṛiṣhi. And, that’s why he’s called as Kṛiṣhṇa.<br>
Now, the seed that he has sown, is the seed of spirituality. It is Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa who said, in Sanskrit “Nainaṃ chindanti śhastrāṇi, nainaṃ dahati pāvakaḥ, Na chainaṃ kledayanty āpo, na śhoṣhayati mārutaḥ” [Bhagavad Gītā 2.23], meaning – it cannot be, means, the spiritual life or you can say, the eternal life, or the Spirit, cannot be killed by anything, by any weapon, neither can be blown away by air, nor can it be sucked in, nor can it be destroyed."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"With the understanding that today is the day – <b>in the night about 12 o’clock</b>, now it must be about 12 o’clock in India also, about that, so it matches – <b>He was born at this time in the night</b>, because it was real night symbolically, under horrible circumstances He came. At a time then, when His own birth was very dangerously placed, He was saved and then in His very childhood He killed rākṣhasas. But all this He did because He was an Incarnation."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa did little mischief with Indra.<br> 
Indra, who is a God, or you can call semi-God, for looking after the rain. So, Indra got very angry.
You see all such semi-Gods are very sensitive people, at the smallest thing they get angry and irritated and they start using their powers to express their anger. So he started pouring rain on all the gopas and Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, who were looking after the cows. And the rain was so heavy that they thought that the whole land will be completely submerged. So Indra was very happy to spoil the game of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. And, he thought he was very successful.<br> 
<b>So, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa lifted a mountain on His finger</b>,<br> 
and all these people who were getting drowned, went under that mountain.<br> 
<b>This is Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa’s style.</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkGreen">"So in His childhood He used to play, He used to play with milkmaids and with other ladies. He was very young, He was about five years of age. And He did all kinds of pranks and He did all kinds of Līlās, like He killed one snake, very big snake – a cobra – very well-known cobra."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="FireBrick">"So Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa normally behaved like a very ordinary person. Like in His childhood, He was very fond of butter. And as you know butter is very good for the throat.<br>
So He was very fond of butter and He would go and make His friends help Him, and made a pyramid out of them, would climb up and break the butter container and would eat all that butter like a little baby."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="blue">"This is only outward, this is the outward manifestation of the Viśhuddhi chakra’s improvement within yourself, through the awakening of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa on Viśhuddhi chakra.<br>
But what happens really is that, inside you, you become a witness. You become a witness in the sense that all that is disturbing, all that is troubling you, all that is a problem, you just start watching it, you start witnessing it, you start seeing it, and you do not get disturbed. That seeing, that Witnessing State has a vi... tremendous power. Whatever you see without thinking, your problems get solved. Any problem you have, once you get this Witness State – what you call taṭasth, means you are standing on the shores and is watching the waves to move – then you know how to solve the problems.<br>
So, your Witness State has to be developed, and sometimes I have seen, people have to go through little difficulties to develop that Witness State. This is very important that once the Kuṇḍalinī starts supplying you from uh your Sahasrāra downward, moving on your uh chakras and enriching your different chakras, on the Viśhuddhi chakra when It has to stay, It really tries to uh little bit take you through turmoils.<br>
But this is the time when you should become taṭastha, means you should become a witness. If you become a witness, everything improves.<br>
And this is the best state which you call as Sākṣhi Swarūpatva, which you achieve when the Kuṇḍalinī comes up and the connection is established and the Divine Grace starts following [flowing] through that and enriches your Viśhuddhi chakra."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">O Divine Power of Yoga, absorb our central nervous system into one, uniting us in one world, one enlightened brain.<br>
You give the integration between brain and heart that makes it easy to have a divine and dharmic life. 
You are the vehicle for understanding Dharma and preserving society.<br>
Please enlighten our brains completely so we are able to become Sakshi-swarupa, witnesses to the play that allows problems to be solved.</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"...... Great quality of Yogeśhwara was complete discretion power built-in. So He knew who was a devil and who was not, who is good who is bad, who is possessed who is not possessed, who is innocent who is not. This was built-in within Him, this power of complete discrimination.<br>
And He had a capacity more expressing His witness-hood, as a Sākṣhi. He had the capacity, I mean He was a Sākṣhi Himself. I should say this way is easier to understand. He was a Sākṣhi, He had the capacity of witnessing the whole world as a play.<br>
...... <b>Now this capacity in Him to witness has to be seen in every Yogi.</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>So the main Principle of Kṛiṣhṇa was collectivity</b> – Rāsa – everybody one with the energy; energy circulates through everyone, and just the opposite that the country developed into individualism and everything was to create something that collective was not. Individualism, when it is not connected to the mains, is destruction. Like all these trees you see, they are individuals as you see them separate, but inside they are fed by the same Mother [Earth]. They have the same sap running in them. When this connection is broken, then all this individualism is nothing but destruction and that’s how in America the connection with the collectivity was broken by every sort of funny methods that one cannot conceive how human beings can go to that level."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Collectivity, you are representatives of the Virāṭ of the Collective Being.</b> Complete circulation and love and affection. Not that love and affection mean perverted or degenerated, but pure love, pure love, enjoying another person’s Spirit. You are responsible for it. If I cannot get Viśhuddhi chakra all right, Sahaja Yoga won’t be all right. Viśhuddhi chakra has to be all right, though last time I said I’ll never go to America. How can it be? I have to come again and again. And you have to be greater and greater people, understanding the responsibility you have towards Divine. Be responsible. It’s not only that Michael is responsible or somebody else is responsible. Every one of you. You are like the vowels. Vowels are important. Without vowels, consonants have no meaning. Everybody is a vowel. Everybody has to be responsible."</font><br>
