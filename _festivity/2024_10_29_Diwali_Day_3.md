<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now you have to enlighten many lights, we call it Dīpawali, Diwālī is dīpāwali, means the rows of lights, and by celebrating this Diwālī with so many of you I'm sure we'll have such a torch of light which will go around the whole world.</b><br>
Just remember you are not a small drop, now you have become the Ocean and you have to spread.<br>
Now you are sitting on your thrones and assume your powers. You have all the powers within you, you have to just manifest it. You have to just feel yourself, understand yourself what is your responsibility.<br>
You have been asking for light now you've got the light, you have become the light, now give light to others.<br>
So achieve a state where your light is on your head, on your Sahasrāra and that it is in your heart, you are not ordinary people, never think that way, actually in Sahaja Yoga only so-called ordinary people will come."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"Sahaja Yogi is a special character of a soldier who fights for the Truth. That kind of a personality, when you will have, there will be lights all over.<br>
In this Diwālī Day, I bless you all from My heart and I want you to respect yourself and understand what is the position of your being in this l... something ... organization we can call or a, in this Movement of Sahaja Yoga, and how are we working it out. The attention should move from all this nonsensical, mundane things to your Self. It should be a very dynamic force that should work out. And I am sure next year it will be very different. We'll have all the beautiful blessings of the Divine. We must do it collectively, understandingly.<br>
May God bless you!"</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Now we have got, <b>astrologically there are three and a half auspicious days where you don't have to consultant</b> any uh ... any books of astrology, which are called as Pañchāṅg, ......<br>
<b>One of them is today. Is a day you can do anything good, you decide anything good. Today is the day to take an oath, to think of something great, to visualize something big, to ask a boon, to do a big Pūjā, is one of the greatest uh day. One of the, we call them muhūrtas, which where you do not consultant these books.<br>
And that's why rājyābhiṣhek of, I mean the crowning ceremony of Śhrī Rāma took place on this day.</b><br>
So there are so many aspects for this that, after Rāma had killed Rāvaṇa, another satanic force, this Diwālī was celebrated. Also, this was celebrated much earlier, when Narakāsura [Tārakāsura] was killed. And this is how we express our joy and happiness, our gratitude to God that He has protected us always with His Power, with His Śhakti and has destroyed all the rākṣhasas and all the evil forces of this world.<br>
<b>This is the time of Thanksgiving. On this day we have to go to our elders and give thanks to them for whatever they have done for us. To all those people whom we have to give thanks, today is the day when we have to ask God to bless all these people.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"...... <b>Lakṣhmī Pūjā, means the day they worship Lakṣhmī. I've told you many a times, the symbol of Lakṣhmī was created really beautifully. And it was so that She came out of the water. Through the water She came out so clean. And She has no pride. She doesn't assert Herself. She doesn't put Her pressure on others.</b><br>
......<br>
Because She stands only on a lotus. Can you imagine how light She must be to stand on a lotus? She has a big body, everything is there, but She stands on a lotus. That She takes all Her weight within Herself, She just sucks in Her weight as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa has described. That like a tortoise sucks in his legs inside his body, in the same way we have to suck in all the weight of money, weight of your positions, weight of your so-called education, weight of some aristocratic family you are born of. This is all nonsense which makes you a heavy person to go down very fast.<br>
So She stands, or floats in a way, on the lotus. And what a thing is beautiful, this lotus, that She doesn't disturb any petals of the lotus, nothing. She just stands, peacefully, in a balance. Unless and until you have balance you cannot stand on a lotus. So She is so balanced. Her center of gravity is so balanced that She cannot topple down.<br>
......<br>
<b>Now She has a hand, one hand like this, one hand like this, and there are two hands which have got again the lotuses, the pink ones.</b> Yesterday you saw the pink. Pink is Her fragrance, I think is spread on the sky. And She is pink, pink because that shows that Her house, Her nature is pink. Pink is inviting, is loving. She is a very fond hostess, that She wants everybody to come in, in Her house."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"So there are two aspects of this thing we have understood is that Lakṣhmī fulfills all our monetary needs plus also she gives us all the balance, all the joy, all the bliss in the family.<br>
Now the problem is with us that unless and until we meditate, unless and until we reach that state of satisfaction we cannot see the work of this Divine Power."</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>You are all, as I said, you are My light. And the light is there which is an eternal light.</b> These lights will be finished. We'll have to light them every year. Not you people. You have eternal light and this light is going to spread Joy. What's the problem of this world? The whole problem, you take it. There's no joy. Simple as that -- there's no joy. If they had joy, they would not have done all these nonsensical things. There's no joy. When you have joy, you don't want to fight, you don't want to do anything that is harmful. You don't want to say anything after anyone, not only that but you do not want to have something that will spoil this Mother Earth or which will bring ecological problem. No, you just don't want it, don't want to do anything because it harms harms others. People feel unhappy about it whether it is here, India, anywhere. You just feel that 'Why should I do such a thing which is not so congenial to others?' I mean, it's not joy-giving.<br>
So when you have joy, you have to be joy-giving. And if you are not joy-giving, that means there's something lacking in your Sahaja Yoga and that's why we have to come up now. We have to become Sahaja Yoginīs and Sahaja Yogis. That is joy-giving society. We can change our name, if you like, if not Sahaja Yoga is good: 'Joy-giving Association'."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So's today we are here to enjoy our joy. Our Ātmānanda, Nirānand and Paramānanda, all these we are here to enjoy, which are of eternal value.</b><br>
You have to understand that now believe that you are in the Kingdom of God and all the subtle beauties of your being are going to be opened out to you. You are going to see yourself all the beauty. But here, if your eyes are already closed, if your heart is already closed and you don't want to see something that's so beautiful, how can I say what a beautiful thing they have made? Is a very important thing in life, is to have a very positive attitude. For Sahaja Yoga also. In Sahaja Yoga we have to develop ourselves within."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"Now, the ... celebration of Diwālī should be that we carry the light all over the world and enlighten people, as many as we can. None of our private things, no... none of our own problems are important. So the, that what it is: that we have to realize that we have got a certain position, which no one has in this world. So, once you understand, your own esteem goes up, and you see for yourself what you have to do!<br>
So then, everybody should, today, decide and take an oath, that, 'We'll do everything to spread Sahaja Yoga with humility.'<br>
So now we'll have the Pūjā and in this Pūjā you all should promise to yourself that you will create a dīpāwali [row of lights] in every household in every country in the whole world.<br>
May God bless you all."</b></font><br>
