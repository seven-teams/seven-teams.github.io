<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we are worshiping Ādi Śhakti.</b><br>
I think this is the most important Pūjā, because it is the Power of Ādi Śhakti that has given you Self-realization, that has given you the Truth, that has given you the Power of Compassion and Love.<br>
That’s the power that separated from Sadāśhiva. And this Power wanted Herself to create this Complete Universe: universes after universes. She’s creating and loving. With Her love, She did this Great Creation, Creation of this world also.<br>
This is a specially selected planet, which was very beautifully brought in the center, between the Sun and the Moon, for the creation of, ultimately, the human beings."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we are all going to worship Me, first time. It has been always the Pūjā of [an] aspect of Me or a part of Me.</b><br>
Now, one has to know very clearly what is Ādi Śhakti. As we say, is the Pure Desire of God Almighty, of Sadāśhiva. But what is the pure Desire of God Almighty?<br>
If you see your own desires, come out of what? Not out of the Divine Love but out of carnal love, out of material love, of out of power love. Behind all these desires there is love.<br> 
If you do not love something you will not desire it. So, these mundane types of love that you have, for which we spend so much of our time uselessly, actually they do not give you satisfaction, because that is not true love that you have. Just infatuation for the time being, and then you just get fed up with it, and from there you jump to another thing, to another thing, to another thing. So Ādi Śhakti is the Embodiment of God's Divine Love, is God's Pure Love, and in His Love what did He desire? He desired that He should create human beings, who would be very obedient, would be sublime, would be like angels. And that was His idea: to create Adam and Eve. "</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Love is the Message of Ādi Śhakti.<br>
Now you think about it. One Ādi Śhakti created the whole world.</b> How she must have done it. What she must have planned. How she must have organized. It is not a[n] easy thing. Only because she loved.<br>
Love is the expression that you are all there. That is why to be one with Her one should learn to love.<br> 
Of course in that you have to know that you should forgive. If you don’t know how to forgive and find mistakes of other people you won’t help. What is your now job is, is to see that you are loving, no hatred for anyone, you don’t think of hating anyone and hitting somebody.<br>
This has to work out."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Somebody asked Me “Is it necessary to have this Pūjā.” I think if there is any Pūjā you should do, it is this one – is Ādi Shakti.<br>
It is very important that this Pūjā must be performed</b> because that is how you grow, this reflection improves and you grow more and more within yourself, through the power of Ādi Shakti or through the power of Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
As you know that Ādi Shakti has her own Kuṇḍalinī, which is the Ādi Kuṇḍalinī, and the reflection of that within you – is the Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
So you have to worship and it’s the best way to please your own Kuṇḍalinī, your own Mother, who has given you this birth"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed>">"And at this place meet the three chakras, and that is why Śhrī Mahākālī, Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī and Śhrī Mahāsaraswatī, all these Three Powers meet.<br> 
<b>As these Three Powers meet, they form One Power, that is Śhrī Ādi Śhakti.<br>  
That is why in Sahasrāra Śhrī Ādi Śhakti resides, but it is said so, that in Sahasrāra Ādi Śhakti exists in a form of Mahāmāyā -- Śhrī Ādi Śhakti exists, but She is in the form of Mahāmāyā.</b><br>
That is why the result of all these Three Powers was like this, that Śhrī Ādi Śhakti comes into this world in the form of Mahāmāyā (Mahāmāyā Swarūp), and She can penetrate the Sahasrāra of everyone.<br>
As you know, She is in front of you and you know all about it, so I need not tell anything more."</font><br>

Śhrī Ādi Śhakti, Your work is greater than any.<br>
You created the Pīṭhas, the chakras, nature and humanity, and its subtle workings.<br>
May the complexity of Your work humble us down completely.<br>
Your love gives power to the bandhan, which directs the vibrations.<br>
Your power of Kuṇḍalinī brings freedom that is divine. It is the only true freedom.</b></font><br>
