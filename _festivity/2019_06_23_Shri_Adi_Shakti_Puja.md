<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are all going to worship Me – first time. It has always been the Pūjā of an aspect of Me or a part of Me. Now, one has to know very clearly what is Ādi Shakti.</b><br>
As we say, it is the Pure Desire of God Almighty, of Sadāshiva. But what is the pure desire of God Almighty? If you see your own desires, come out of what? Not out of the Divine Love but out of carnal love, out of material love, out of power love. Behind all these desires there is love.<br>
If you do not love something you will not desire it. So, these mundane types of love that you have, for which we spend so much of our time uselessly, actually they do not give you satisfaction, because that is not true love that you have. Just infatuation for the time being, and then you just get fed up with it, and from there you jump to another thing, to another thing, to another thing. <b>So Ādi Shakti is the embodiment of God’s Divine Love, is God’s pure love, and in his love what did He desire? He desired that He should create human beings, who would be very obedient, would be sublime, would be like angels.</b> And that was His idea: to create Adam and Eve."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Somebody asked Me, “Is it necessary to have this Pūjā?” I think if there is any Pūjā you should do, it is this one – is Ādi Shakti. It is very important that this Pūjā must be performed,</b> because that is how you grow, this reflection improves and you grow more and more within yourself, through the power of Ādi Shakti or through the power of Kuṇḍalinī. As you know that Ādi Shakti has her own Kuṇḍalinī, which is the Ādi Kuṇḍalinī, and the reflection of that within you – is the Kuṇḍalinī. So you have to worship and it’s the best way to please your own Kuṇḍalinī, your own Mother, who has given you this birth"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"The poor seekers had to face lot of problems. While meditating they were tortured. <b>So Ādi Śhakti incarnated on this Earth 108 times in Her perfect form.</b> You might have read about it. Read Devī Māhātmyam and you will know what I am saying. <b>Ādi Śhakti incarnated in the form of the Devī and recognized the seekers. At that time She came in the clear form of Devī. There was no māyā around Her. So seekers could not get their Self-realization form Her.</b> The only thing they got was Her protection. She killed Mahiṣhāsura, Śhumbha–Niśhumbha and many others. All the rākṣhasas and negative people who used to torture the Saints were killed. But none of them got salvation because they were not perfect human beings."</font><br>

<font color="RebeccaPurple">"<b>Now, in India they have a word for Holy Spirit and this word is Ādi Śhakti. Ādi, means primordial and śhakti means power. Ādi Śhakti means Primordial Power or the Very Power of God. The Ādi Śhakti is also said to be the Mother of the Universe.</b><br>
Now, in our Christian tradition we have a Divine Family where you have a Father who is God the Almighty and we have a Son who is Jesus Christ.<br>
But do you know of a family where there is a father and a son without a mother? So the third is what we call the Holy Spirit."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"You perhaps do not realize that all the Deities who reside in you and who are controlled in your Sahasrara are not at all interested in people who are not completely surrendered to me. I do not know how to convince them. <b>They only look after those who take my name and accept that I am the Adi Shakti. This is the only way you can progress. What can I do? Even the people who are cured by me have to keep the protocol otherwise the Deities sleep and they go back to their previous position.</b><br>
So far I have not said this to anyone because I thought there was no need. Those who were wise realized it and those who are foolish have lost their chance in Sahaja Yoga."</font><br>
