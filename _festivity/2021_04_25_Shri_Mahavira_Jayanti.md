<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>In Sahaj we very much respect and understand Mahāvīrjī and we also accept that He is the Incarnation of Śhrī Bhairavnāth and not only this he took birth many times and later also came as Hasan and Husayn.</b><br>
In Bible, Bhiaravnāthjī is addressed as Saint George and some refer him as Saint Michael. It is very surprising that London which we understand as Heart has Saint George as its angel. That is! They accept Bhairavnāth so it’s correct. Because if Śhivjī resides in heart then having Bhairavnāth is important. There are so many things which if we read with understanding then they are all interconnected and how is their relation automatically established. In Sahaj Śhakti you get overwhelmed and you enjoy it and this makes Me happy. God has created this universe for you so you should enjoy it, what else do you want. In you, there are many powers and you use them and you have also shared it with others. In this way, the family of our Sahaj should grow."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are going to celebrate the birthday of Mahāvīra.</b><br>
Mahāvīra is the Incarnation of Bhairavanāth, or you call Him as Saint Michael. Now these two Saints as you know one as the Gabriel, Hanumāna, and another is Saint Michael. One is placed on the Piṅgalā nāḍī and another one, Saint Michael, on the Iḍā nāḍī."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Śhrī Mahāvīr resides on our Iḍā nāḍī and rules it. All the conditionings (saṃskāras) that we have in us are corrected by him. He has defined and explained what is hell. What happens when human go to hell and what and how they suffer in hell, he has explained this in very detail. Buddha and Mahāvīr were contemporary (samakālīn) and both of them had a life of penance. Both of them were prince. But still, both of them dedicated themselves in tapasyā. And they found out that when human make mistakes and go to the left side then how he goes in hell and how he suffers. Hell has to be experienced in this world."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>After they get their Realization, that He called as Kevalagyān</b>: only the knowledge, only knowledge, means Pure Knowledge. They will develop some Samyak Darśhan, means Integrated Personality and all the Collective Consciousness. He talked of all, all these things.<br>
But as He belonged to the left side, He has described Hell very clearly. Fundamentally, basically, there are Fourteen Hells according to Him. And is horrible to read all that, what He has described about Hell. Because He wanted to tell people that, ‘If you do all these wrong things, you’ll go to Hell.’ And He talked about, not about Form, Formly God, but Formless God, because He didn’t want people to again start ritualism but get to right ... right to the position where they could get their Self-realization to cleanse themself."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"He was a Reincarnation of Saint Michael and He resides on the left side, on the Iḍā nāḍī.<br>
And He looks after the whole of it, right from Mūlādhāra onwards up to the Sahasrāra.<br> 
So Saint Michael was born as Mahāvīra, meaning, <b>The Greatest Warrior.<br>
But when He was born, the whole place got lot of uh prosperity, that’s why He was called as Vardhamān, to begin with.</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So, they are talking about the Collective Subconscious area, which lies beyond the subconscious. So, this <b>Collective Subconscious is the one, which contains all that is the past, all that is there</b>. Now there are many vegetables, which went out of circulation of evolution. These when they enter into our being exist within us because everything that is past and future exists within us. So, once they enter into our body, we get these virus infections. <b>Virus comes from these things, which are of the past and they enter into us and pull us towards the Collective Subconscious and that’s how we get the symptoms of virus and you know that virus cannot be treated.</b> It has to be allowed to pass out. So they just enter into our being and pass out ......<br>
Now, when you start moving too much towards the left, due to the activity of the left side, means a person who is very emotional or who bows to wrong type of people.<br>
That’s why it is said don’t bow your head to wrong type of people. If you bow too much to people out of slavery and all that, all these people start getting conditioned and all that and <b>superego develops and they go to the Collective Subconscious area where they are, they get caught up by these proteins which we call in our ordinary language, as bhūt</b>."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"So unless and until you touch your depth, you’ll become like any other religion, because you won’t be actually Sahaj Yogis, just nominal.<br>
So we have to work in such a manner that we understand ourselves and we understand our attention and we try to ascend. I don’t have to tell you. You yourself have to work it out in such a manner that you touch your depth and you become an ascetic within yourself. Then only you will be really uh doing the Divine work properly, with proper understanding.<br>
<b>Sahaj Yoga is the integration of all these Great Prophets and these Incarnations. So, I have to tell you that, whatever were your conditionings and all that, to get rid of them, you must get out of this Ocean of Illusion.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Even though Saraswatī has created all the Swaras, so what! but the emotions it contains, the bhakti it contains it is due to the blessings of Mahāvīr.</b><br> 
Mahāvīr has really worked hard for this because he scared people that if you go to the wrong way, you go to hell, and on taking this correct way you will be overwhelmed and you all are actually witnessing it.<br>
 Like this, we all should increase our bhakti and growing bhakti in the work of Mahāvīr."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"...... so you have take the name of Mahavira just to remove that pressure from the left side.<br>
Now many people do not even know why they suffer. Why should they suffer, when they have done nothing wrong? Because they are possessed.<br>
Now even the viruses and all these things like psychosomatic troubles, like cancer, all, I would say, the incurable diseases are there because we are triggered into the left side.<br>
That’s why we are suffering from these diseases which are not curable.<br>
<b>So we have to thank really very much Mahavira, who has given us this power to remove our left-sided problems, who has given us this light in our hand, which He Himself vibrates, and He Himself tries to throw some light on the obscure things about Me also.<br>
Because of Him only, we can get cured of so many physical and mental troubles.<br>
You know that the left side can be easily cured if you use three-candle treatment.<br>
That shows Mahavira is only fond of light. He doesn’t like darkness.</b><br>
And His idea is, I think that way, is to now fully go all the way to clear the left side as far as possible, to help Sahaja Yoga to establish in countries where I find still lot of this negativity is there – a lot of it.<br>
So He’s working it out, everywhere, and the psychosomatic diseases and all these diseases also, we can work it out with candle-light and all that, with three candles we can do this treatment.<br>
So you have to be very thankful to Him that He has achieved this kind of entry into the left side and has found out for us what sort of problems exist on left side."</font><br>
