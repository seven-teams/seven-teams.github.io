<font color="DarkRed">"Nothing is rigid. Rigidity comes from ignorance.<br>
It's all for you, for your joy and happiness. <b>The whole festival system is for your happiness and not for the happiness of the time or date. It's for you, so it should be adjustable according to your needs and understanding.</b> And also according to your national way you live. They should be no addiction to any particular type of culture, a particular type of ideas. It's all for you. All these festivals are for you, not for Gods. They don't have these festivals. It's only for you people these festivals are there. <b>And when you celebrate them, that's only for your joy and your happiness. And that's how you should celebrate in a way that gives you the greatest amount of happiness. And the festivals, all the festivals of the world must be celebrated.</b> The more you are festive, the happier it is."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"But <b>today is a special day: is the day when the Sun changes from the Tropic of Capricorn, comes from the Tropic of Capricorn, to the Tropic of Cancer. And for us it is a summer.</b><br> 
Sounds a very good thing for us to have a summer here, and we call it a thing of transformation. But is a <b>Tropic of Cancer, Cancer as you know is a sign of the Mother</b>. So this is the day they celebrate suddenly coming out of the cold to the heat, they eat something called 'til gur' [ladū] that is the sesame and the jaggery mixed together. And they tell people, "Eat this sweet and speak sweetly." The reason is: when the heat comes up too much the mind can go off and one can become harsh. So they say now, "Eat this and speak sweetly." Now the hot thing, it's a hot thing to eat sesame and the jaggery but why it is given that is the end of it now. You have it and slowly come to normal. So it is given like that to show that now is the end of it, you take it and now you come to the end of it.<br>
......<br>
And today is a special day but this day being decided by the Sun is a fixed day, is fourteenth, fourteenth of this month. So this is called as a Saṅkrānti Day. So it doesn't change, all other things can change because they depend on the Moon but this is the only solar, you can say, only solar festival we have."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is Saṅkrānti. Saṅkrānti means that today there is something new going to happen. Kuṇḍalinī has awakened within you and you have become new person compared to what you were before. But on the day of Saṅkrānti, you should know that you have to please the Goddess who is sitting within you.</b> What should you do to make Her happy? You distributed sesame seeds and jaggery. That is for love. To increase the love between each other, we give sesame seeds and jaggery.<br>
Today the Sun left its place and, in its northward movement, came towards us. At this moment we should be very thankful to the Sun. It is by the grace of the Sun that so many things take place in our country. We have to do namaskār to the Sun today and His Power and His knowledge should come to us. I would say that all of you have become realized and vibrations are flowing through you. Now you should make use of these vibrations, establish the śhakti within you, establish the peace within you and show the world that this power is within us and we have to acquire it. We have to nurture this, improve this with your good qualities and truthful speech.<br>
<b>Today is very special day because the Sun is particularly benevolent towards us on this day. And we should thank Him for all this. You have received a lot, there is more to come and you will get much more. We should increase it. All of you did so many Pūjās to Me. I am surprise to know what you want from all these Pūjās?</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"So today is a great day. This saṅkramaṇa that has started requires serious effort. We cannot play about with that. It's very great emergency. I can feel in the atmosphere the emergency. All the Gods and Goddesses are there to help you to work it out. You are in ... on the stage and you have to create that great drama of revolution.<br>
We have to show to this world that it's only the Spirit that can save the world, nothing else. And so, from today we start our journey towards that subtlety and that sensitivity, which you can feel, with which you can feel Nirānanda. Nirānanda, your Mother's name is Nirā, and at Sahasrāra you feel the ānanda, the joy of Nirā.<br>
May God bless you all."</b></font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"For India, today is a very important day because the Sun is coming from the south to the north side.<br>
<b>The most important thing in Sahaja Yoga is that you have to change and that's what you should do to the Goddess with changed heart, full of love, affection and kindness.<br>
Therefore, hope you will spread Sahaja Yoga. It is very important because you know My vision is too big and you have to really work hard to fulfill My vision. And to give Realization to people as many as possible. You have to think what is your mind doing. There are many people who are waiting to come in Sahaja Yoga. You should have the light of spirituality: you have to feel that you are spiritual, you have to grow it, and also make others grow.</b><br>
Sahaja Yoga is not limited with you. It's not meant for one individual, not at all for one person but for the whole world. We have Sahaja Yogis all over the world, but they don't spread Sahaja Yoga. They are satisfied with their own motives. This is not Sahaja Yoga. You must openly talk about and say about it. But Sahaja Yogis are very shy, they don't talk about Sahaja Yoga. They can do it, no doubt.<br>
The Sun changes its direction, everybody knows about it, everybody prays for it.<br>
People take bath in the River Ganges for purification. This is all right.<br>
Now it is a time for purification, identification and also of understanding the importance of Sahaja Yoga. I don't know how many people really understand the importance of Sahaja Yoga. If that is understood, one can do a lot of work in Sahaja Yoga. It is such a noble work, which you all have to do it collectively. And then you feel your life has a meaning, otherwise there is no meaning and no light in your life. So you have to work out in that manner which gives inspiration to others.<br>
You must have introspection, ask questions to yourself, 'What I have done for Sahaja Yog?'"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"So, today's special day, a very great day, let us ask that, when you are doing this Pūjā, ask: for new religions within you, 'to be enshrined, to be sustained within ourselves.' And try to imbibe them. They will be permeating but you have to accept them.<br>
And [you] should know it's a big fight. And it's a very different type of a fight: of peace and love.<br>
That's why they say: 'Speak sweetly, be sweet to each other.'<br>
Not to be sarcastic by any chance, nor to be harsh, but be sweetch [sweet]. Sweetness which is genuine: not outward and showy and formal, but genuine sweetness.<br>
May God bless you all."</b></font><br>
