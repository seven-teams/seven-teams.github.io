<font color="DarkRed">"<b>And, today’s day is a very great day for us because the Saints are celebrating Diwālī. I’m celebrating My Diwālī enlightening light in your hearts that you enjoy your own joy and your own beauty; that you are now the Spirit. Enjoy it. That you are there. Now, you are in the Kingdom of God. No doubt.</b><br>
I mean, even if you don’t do anything anymore, you will be all right there. But you should not take it for granted. You have to come forward because your Mother needs your help. You have to stand up. You have to rise. You have to come up. You have to become the leaders of tomorrow. So, you have to work it out. And, not just be talkers and thinking big and saying big, big things ......"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"The fifteenth day of the waning Moon is called as Amāvāsyā. So, this is the darkest night. There are always dark nights every month once, but this is the darkest night of the whole year and just before this Narakāsura was killed. And all the lights are put in the house and lots of these lamps are burnt. Of course, electricity lights are different from these, as you know, that they burn baddhas all the time.<br>
So, after the death of Narakāsura, he had a big army of his own when he was powerful and he had hypnotized many people, so to get rid of the residual ones altogether, they lighted all these lamps, so that all those devils who were still roaming about should all be burnt out. And you can understand in Sahaja Yoga how a lamp burns and ha ... how a baddha is taken away by a lamp. But still all the lights of the house must be lighted.<br>
[Aside:] Will you go and light all the lights in the house.
Outside and inside, there should be everywhere there should be light. No room should be kept in dark because they hide in the darkness. So no corner should be dark."</font><br>

<b>O Divine Mother, You are verily Śhrī Lakṣhmī. Salutations to You!</b>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"You know that today is the Pūjā of Śhrī Lakṣhmī. Here nobody performs Lakṣhmī Pūjā. So, it must be understood that today is a very important day. Lakṣhmī gives you everything. She is Mother. She gives everything, all blessings, all comfort, and most important is that She enlightens your inner being.<br>
So somehow you recognize Lakṣhmī. Lakṣhmī doesn’t mean money. You have to understand that She is a Goddess, and you have to respect money like a Goddess. In our country, people do a lot for the sake of money; wrong things that are very bad. But you have got a responsibility to recognize Lakṣhmī as Devī, and worship Her and understand that you cannot make fun of Lakṣhmī. Lakṣhmī blesses you and will go on blessing you. Such evil people are a few only, and you should be contented that Lakṣhmī resides in your being and has accumulated many moments of joy and comfort for you. You are going to get all that and have already got it.<br>
...... I am sure that everyone will worship Lakṣhmī, and in the Lakṣhmī Pūjā one should understand all forms of Lakṣhmī and what Her nature is. We cannot understand Her, and if we cannot understand Her, we will follow the wrong path. So it should be understood that She is Devī and that She is your Mother, and that She can do anything for you, because She is very powerful and very affectionate, She doesn’t give you any problem.<br>
If you get trapped somewhere, She will save you. Such is the blessing [greatness] of Lakṣhmī."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So today is a celebration of real Diwālī. I always say that in India we were producing the Diwālī lights with ordinary mud, but now, in Sahaja Yoga, we have lotuses which are giving light, the fragrance. Such beautiful things they are and the way you are enjoying it and expressing your joy is so very beautiful. But to be the lotus you have to give up this mud, this darkness – you have to give up that. If you can’t give up that, then you cannot enjoy your own lotus and others can’t enjoy.<br>
So that giving up is not difficult. You see, when people say that, <b>“You have to love your Mother,” just means that you give up your ego and your conditionings and become a pure personality, that’s all. I mean, in any case all of you love Me but still under limitations. You must love Me without limitations, then it is a real love as I love you.</b> For this we have to thank this time. This time is great. As I call it the Blossom Time, that at this time you were all born and at this time I came and at this time this combination took place and at this time Sahaja Yoga was established."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"It was to celebrate the coronation of Śhrī Rāma also, that is to say symbolically to celebrate the establishment of a kingdom which has a benevolent administration. ......<br>
..So today is a special day to celebrate the Kingdom of God on Earth. As we have ... used to pray “Thy Kingdom come on this earth” and it has come today on this mountain and we are here to celebrate the coming of the Kingdom of God as we have been praying for ages. And the blessings of Kingdom of God is that you get drenched in joy – joy which has no duality, like happiness and unhappiness. Is an experience of absoluteness and just that joy is sufficient, you don’t want any food, you don’t want to sleep, you don’t mind where you are, just in joy drenched completely. There’s no place for unhappiness, we have no heart for it."</font><br>
