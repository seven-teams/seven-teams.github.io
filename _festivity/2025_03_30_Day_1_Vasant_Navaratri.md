<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>In India, Navarātri falls twice in a year. Once it is in the month of Chaitra as it is today.</b><br> 
On this day Devī is worshiped as Śhailaputrī, means the daughter of Himalaya. Devī has many other names also but first of all She incarnated as Śhailaputrī in the cold of Himalayas. She incarnated and whatever She was to do, She started there.<br>
Further story is known to you. [King] Dakṣha did not invite Lord Śhiva in the Havana that he performed and Śhailaputrī was the consort of Lord Śhiva. She is called Satī because She entered the Holy fire of Havana and ablated Herself. But by then Lord Śhiva reached there. He lifted Her burnt up body from the fire. Burnt pieces of the body of Śhailaputrī fell at many places. All these places are considered to be Śhakti Pīṭhas, the places of worship, as there is in Vindhyāchala and many other places. Her power moves there and it is said that it Sanctifies everything.<br>
Her seventh power is considered to be the Power of Destruction. Śhakti manifested Itself on the right side as Sāvitrī and Gāyatrī but the destroying force was manifested in the center.<br>
In the form of Durgā and Her other forms manifested in Heart chakra. She is present there.<br>
If some one hurts you, confuses or disturbs you then this power will protect you and destroy your enemy.<br>
When Kuṇḍalinī rises and reaches the Heart chakra then it manifests and becomes more powerful and effective because Kuṇḍalinī is Jagadambā. In Sahaja Yoga when Kuṇḍalinī is awakened it settles in Heart chakra. It protects you and takes care of you nicely. No one could harm you at all, if you keep the Mother in your heart. The power of the mother always protects the children. Whenever there is some danger, it is mentioned in medical terminology that the sternum bone starts shaking and antibodies that are present all around get alarmed. In sahaja language these antibodies are called gaṇas. They get ready to fight it out. She is the empress of these gaṇas. They follow her commands as there is no difference between Śhrī Gaṇeśha and Devī. Both are so identified. Gaṇeśha is Her Son and She is His Mother. In Sahaja Yoga She protects all those who have awakened Śhrī Gaṇeśha in themselves. She protects them just like Her own children at every step. She supports them because She is the Mother and you are the Gaṇeśha. But the Gaṇeśha within you should be fully awakened and pure. If there is obstruction in this chakra, it should be removed."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Chaitra is the month.</b> And this is the time when -- ...... -- <b>Gaurī is the Chaitra. So the establishment of the Gaurī is taken place during these nine days.</b> But Gaṇeśha has to be established before anything else. Though first Gaurī had to come, you can see that. Gaurī had to come first to establish Gaṇeśha. But Gaṇeśha is always put before even Gaurī. Before the Pūjana of the, worship of the Gaṇeśha, nothing starts; because He's the one who takes out all the obstacles, all the negativities, all the hurdles that are going to come up, all the attentions that are here and there. So that's why we first worship Gaṇeśha, just to ask Him to protect us. "</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today it's a great day, very, very great day. I said about this day at ...... <b>That first day [Guḍhī Pāḍavā] of these nine nights [of Vasanat Navarātri], in this year, will start the manifestation of the New Age.</b><br>
Of course, the New Age has come long time back. But the manifestation did not work out that much. It will start, I'm sure.<br>
But I find that [the] attitude of human beings towards any divine working is [a] little strange. It has been very strange. If it was not -- they never recognized Christ, they never recognized Rāma, they never recognized Kṛiṣhṇa. In the same way, they will never recognize also Satya Yuga, this New Age.<br>
When these people came, nobody bothered. Those who bothered were only bothered as to see how they kill or torture Them. Nobody could see through Their principles, through Their lives, Their power, that, `There is something great in these Incarnations, and we must make use of it.'<br>
The reason is: man has these old ways of great ignorance."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"I was telling them that after the introduction of this calendar the Śhālivāhan King founded his kingdom and lived there from the day of the Guḍhī Pāḍavā [Guḍhī is a symbol of auspiciousness]. Since you know all this I did not tell you and explained to them in English.<br>
<b>With respect to the Guḍhī Pāḍavā the shawl has great significance. The Śhālivāhan Kings always carried the Goddess's shawl with them.</b> You know the significance of Devī's shawl. You know it gives Her beauty. With the shawl She protects Herself from cold and wind. Also with it She protects Her chastity, as well as if any dirt is about to touch Her body it is prevented. <b>So, a shawl which is offered to Goddess symbolizes Her protection, meaning, `As You protect us we offer You this.' Further if the children are sleeping or are sick or have a problem, then She covers them with the shawl. So shawl is very important.</b> You know, in the past it was a practice with all people in Maharashtra to take [put a] shawl over their bodies. Now that we have become modern we do not take it.

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Kuṇḍalinī is Gaurī, today is Gaurī Pūjan, Gaurī Pūjan in the month of Chaitra is special. Means before installation of Gaṇapati we have installed Gaurī in the month of Chaitra. Gaurī who created Gaṇapati is the Gaurī from Chaitra and we all believe that.<br>
In the same way our Śhālivāhans have given it so much importance that Guḍhī Pāḍavā starts on the first day of Chaitra month, because Gaurī first is Śhakti, who started the work, to start any work first we worship Gaṇeśha, this is also done by Gaurī.</b><br>
Gaurī has put Gaṇeśh in the temporal world or universe so that the innocence which Gaṇeśh has should spread in the whole world. And before anyone else, She established Chaitanya in the form of Gaṇeśh for the whole world and spread it everywhere. Then we will do whatever is required but first is the Spirit, the Chaitanya. The world's Kuṇḍalinī, Mother Gaurī has done this work.<br>
The importance of this day is that this is the beginning, creating Śhrī Gaṇeśh on Her on own, no contribution from Sadāśhiv, She has not yet met Sadāśhiv, so the Virgin Gaurī, She created Gaṇapati from Her Powers, because She is Śhakti Swarūpa, She can do anything. And that Gaṇapati is pure, holy, which is in the form of Chaitanya, was made"</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Today is new year day and the beginning of the Moon. That is why this day is given so much significance. It is known as Guḍhī Pāḍavā.</b><br>
A flag is put on a stick and on it is put a small pitcher. This pitcher represents Kuṇḍalinī. It is taken as a symbol. The Śhālivāhanas were the devotees of the Devī [Goddess] and it is told that they used to offer shawl to the Goddess. In the beginning they were called Sāt[a]vāhans because they worshiped Seven Plexuses and this Sāt[a]vāhana was ultimately changed into Śhālivāhana.<br>
But the symbol of Śhālivāhana is the same. They put up a `guḍhī' means a flag and a small pitcher is put on it as a symbol. This pitcher has a particular shape which represents Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
So they were the worshipers of Kuṇḍalinī and followed it. That is the reason they made this symbol in this way. All those who follow Kuṇḍalinī put up a guḍhī in their houses and also put a flag on it and thus it is indicated that they welcome Kuṇḍalinī and exhibit it in a special way."</font><br>
