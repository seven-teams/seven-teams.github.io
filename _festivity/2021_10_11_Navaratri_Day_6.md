<font color="DarkRed">"Today is a great day, of Navarātri, we are sitting on the cusp of the sixth and the seventh. <b>Sixth and the seventh is the day when Mahāsaraswatī finished Her work and the Incarnation of the Śhakti Itself started.</b> So at twelve o’clock today the Devī takes the Śhakti upon Herself.<br>
Of course, as you know, that Mahākālī and Mahāsaraswatī, both are the Powers of Śhrī Sadāśhiva. Ādi Śhakti first formed Herself into Mahākālī, which is the Power of Desire. But <b>all these powers are nothing but the Power of God’s Love. So, in the series of this Great Love of God, Ādi Śhakti had to first become the Power of Desire</b>.<br>
In the same way, Sahaja Yogis who are bestowed with this Power of Love has to have full desire in their heart. Desire to love. That desire is very different from the other kinds of human love we have known.<br>
In other kinds of human love, when we have relations with others, we have expectations, and that’s why it is very disappointing."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>That’s how the Power of Saraswatī works. People go into action for achieving the results of getting into power. But it should act to discover the Truth. Saraswatī should give you the leap to find out the Truth.</b><br>
That, when you act in those funny places and streets, you discover this is not the path, we have missed it. The path is somewhere else. We’ve lost it. Let us find out the real path because this doesn’t give joy.<br>
This, one can learn from others, from history, from so many other things, and from your own parents, from your society and from yourself and from your children also.
If you want to learn, that is the quality of Saraswatī pujārīs, that they take to gyāna, they take to reality. Vedas, in the beginning of the Vedas, it’s said that: if by reading these four Vedas, if you do not get the Vida, Vida is the knowledge on your nerves, means Realization, there is no use reading these Vedas.<br>
<b>So the Saraswatī’s first thing is that through the reading, through the process of Saraswatī’s manifestation, you must reach a point to understand that this is a rat race and we have to get out of it. We have to step out.</b><br>
When that happens, then the Mahālakṣhmī Tattwa starts working in you, that is the third tattwa, which starts working.<br>
<b>Mahālakṣhmī Tattwa then starts expressing its love in its full extent through evolutionary process in human beings.</b> He starts evolving simultaneously. He sees on both the sides what’s happening, like a witness and he uses his Mahālakṣhmī Power."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>To all devotees and followers of truth, who have assembled here for the Pūjā, I offer My protection.</b><br>
In this Kali Yug of today, when so much devotion and homage for the Mother,<br>
and so much love comes into the hearts of human beings, then we can know that Satya Yuga has begun.<br>
This is a most fortunate and divine coincidence for Me also, that on a Ṣhaṣhṭhī Day I came to Kolkata.<br> 
Because in the Śhāstras, it is written that the coming of the Mother is always on Ṣhaṣhṭhī Day.<br> 
<b>Ṣhaṣhṭhī Day is of Śhākambharī Devī</b>, and on that day the whole nature should be green and lush."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>This Havan you know is a very good thing for reciting the name of the Goddess. Her eyes are given by fire at this stage. And in that light, in that fire, in the name of Goddess we awaken our Deities within us and throw away all that is wrong in these particular chakras which invoke those powers.</b> So with devotion and understanding you have to do it. Because you are really privileged people, extremely privileged. Be proud of that, and do with that devotion all these things. ...... We should do it with full devotion. I think very few people can put in the fire, but we can all do symbolically and say this."</font><br>

In the same way, we have to promise that we will be consuming all that is evil, in a way to destroy it,<br>
and we will digest and nourish ourselves with the Divine Knowledge."</font><br>
