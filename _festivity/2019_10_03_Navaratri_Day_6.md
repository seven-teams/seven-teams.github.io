<font color="DarkRed">"Now you are worshiping today the Durgā, or all the nine forms of the Goddess. She came nine times on this Earth, according to this, that She fought all the people who were destroying the seekers, who were trying to make a mess of their lives. And these tortured Saints, when they prayed to the Goddess – because none of the Gods could do anything, and Sadāśhiva is never interfering with what the Goddess is doing – so they worshiped the Bhagavatī, and then the Incarnation of Hers came nine times, according to the need of the time. So every time you find Her confronting people who are extremely arrogant, self-opinionated, thinking no end of themselves; and the bhaktas are tortured by these self-opinionated horrible rākṣhasas."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"The negativity that is around you is not so dangerous as whatever is in you. Today it has become subtler. The negativity has become subtler. It’s entered into your being, and be careful – it may anytime topple you. Even one step you do not put right when you are climbing up, you can go down. So one has to be alert, without tension. You have to be alert without tension. And the alertness grows. When the light goes within you start seeing it. Immediately you see, ‘Oh, that’s it! So I, the so-and-so – that’s it!’ And you know how to correct it and you know how to put it right. And immediately you take to it. Like a good sāṛī now has something fallen on it, immediately you clean it.<br>
In the same way, we have to be very, very alert; ‘dakṣha’ is the word for that. Now this was the work of the Goddess before. Goddess used to give enlightenment and Goddess used to be alert for you. She would sit like a tigress for Her children. They are praying, they are doing Pūjā, they are doing some sort of a Homa, Havana, so the Goddess would sit down, protect them from all negativity coming, all rākṣhasas coming, kill them, this, do that. But that stage is gone now. Now She’s entered into you. So you have to kill your negativity, you’ve become as powerful as your Mother. No negativity can touch you."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"We did a Havan in London too [on 1975-1102]. Lot of difference came about in London. The climate changed.<br>
You need to change the climate. With this the atmosphere will be awakened. Sometimes such a lot of vibrations flow from My body that they cannot go into the atmosphere. Atmosphere cannot absorb it.<br>
You all need to be awakened and fix your vibrations. With complete devotion invite. And when They arrive, when They are awakened, then absorb Them. With the offering of everything that is here you are expressing your sense of gratitude. You have done us a lot of favor. We show that to the Gods. ‘Here is the offering of wood that you gave us, we are expressing our gratitude.’ This is the meaning of Havan.<br>
With that all the dirt in your heart, let it burn in this fire. This fire can purify you if you offer the items with that feeling. It is not difficult."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"In Havan the fire devours everything. In the same way by tapas all the negative thoughts and wrong boundaries (maryādās) will break away. To get joy is your right. But to share that joy you must have that depth within."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"This Havan you know is a very good thing for reciting the name of the Goddess. Her eyes are given by fire at this stage. And in that light, in that fire, in the name of Goddess, we awaken our Deities within us and throw away all that is wrong in these particular chakras which invoke those powers. So with devotion and understanding, you have to do it. Because you are really privileged people, extremely privileged. Be proud of that, and do with that devotion all these things. Today is a very much better time because the Dussehra and the Navarātri’s, are both combined at this time. And so it has worked out very well. We should do it with full devotion. I think very few people can put in the fire, but we can all do symbolically and say this."</font><br>
