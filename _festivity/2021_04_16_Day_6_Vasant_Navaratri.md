<font color="DarkRed">"...... the <b>Primordial Mother has one of Her Powers, which we can say, as the Primordial Kuṇḍalinī, is a part of Her. Of course, She’s beyond that, but She is reflected in human beings as the Kuṇḍalinī</b>.<br>
Now one has to know that to create an Incarnation, lot of work has gone into. So many things had to be envisaged. One had to have the vision that, where a human being is created, how an Incarnation can help him. At different levels, we had Incarnations on this Earth and they were sent with a particular idea that they should achieve a particular type of ascent in that particular time. They were all part and parcel of the Primordial Mother and they all had a very powerful Kuṇḍalinī built within them. But the Incarnation of this Kali Yuga is very complicated. First, it had to be worked out what will be the situation in which this Incarnation would be born and what sort of encounters this Incarnation would have.
So the major propelling force, you can say, the major work had to be done in the Incarnation to create a very strong spinal cord so that it could bear the Primordial Kuṇḍalinī, which is responsible for doing this great work of transformation."</font><br>

<font color="blue">"...... you should delve into the collective. When delving into the collective, you must open your heart.<br>
<b>Any person without an open heart, cannot delve into the collective."</b></font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkGreen"><b>Kul’angana Kul’anta-stha, Kaulinı Kula-yoginı,<br>
Akula Samayanta-stha, Samayachara-tatpara. </b></font><br>
O Chaste Lady, residing in the Sacrum bone, whose creation is the chakras,<br> 
and who knows all the secret techniques of the path to Self-realisation;<br>
You are beyond all categories and reside in the Sahasrara,<br>
and are to be found through inner worship You are devoted to those who worship You internally.<br>
<font size="+0"><b>(Śhrī Lalitā Sahasrānama, verse 37)</b></font>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So the Primordial Kuṇḍalinī, which is reflected in you as your Kuṇḍalinī, also is of the same nature and it works in the same way. It rises, gives you Self-realization, gives you the powers, but after all one has to know it is a reflection and a reflection to make it truthful, real. <b>You have to look at reality first, how the real one, the real Kuṇḍalinī, the real Primordial One, how it acts, how it works. If you start thinking about My Kuṇḍalinī only, immediately you will become silent, no question. You cannot think, just you become silent.</b><br>
<b>Just think of any one of My chakras and your chakras will be all right. But you have to have that depth.</b><br>
<b>You have to have that much protocol. You have to have that much right. Just it will act.</b> Don’t have to do anything. Just you have to think of My chakras. Just think about My Kuṇḍalinī. That’s sufficient. But you have to develop that surrendering situation."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="blue">"So for a Kuṇḍalinī growing wider and wider and rising higher and higher, first thing is we must have peace within ourselves, but this peace is possible if you can make really peace with others. If you cannot make peace with others who are in Sahaja Yoga, who are in the collective, if you are in a turmoil, this Kuṇḍalinī can never rise. That is why collectivity is so important. <b>Without collectivity, your Viśhuddhi cannot open, and without collectivity, you cannot have the growth of your spirituality. It’s the growth of the spirituality as they say the Tree of Life is upside down and the roots are in the brain, and this Kuṇḍalinī has to go and water that brain, as we water the roots.</b> Then it starts growing downward and that’s how you start expanding. When you start expanding, then you touch the depth of your divinity, and once you have touched the depths of your divinity then you start working it out in such a manner that people will know that you are Yoginīs, you are people of higher realm, you have something great. It is not how many times you read something, it’s not how many times you talk about Sahaja Yoga, it’s not even how many times you just go on reciting names, but how many times from your heart your pure desire is to ascend."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>You have to be first of all fully equipped with readiness, readiness to serve the Divine.</b><br>
Unless and until you have that readiness, that 'I don’t want anything. I don’t want. I just want to serve the Divine.'<br>
As long as you are striving for it and asking for it with full heart, with full sincerity, then I’m sure this Kuṇḍalinī will be strengthened and 
She’ll cleanse you completely and you’ll one day be Mahāyogis.<br>
May God bless you all."</font><br>
