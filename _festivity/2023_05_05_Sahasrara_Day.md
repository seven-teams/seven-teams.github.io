<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is a very great day, I must say, to celebrate Sahasrāra, the Pūjā of Sahasrāra.</b><br>
It’s a very unique thing that has happened, that your Sahasrāras were opened out.<br>
......<br> 
So it's a very great day because collectively this Sahasrāra has been opened. Every one of you have got it. Also all over the world, you have many people who have got their Sahasrāras open. Of course, we need many more for them to understand what is this great event of such a collective opening of Sahasrāra.<br>
Some have grown very much, after getting their Realization, very much. They have understood Sahaja Yoga very well, and they have developed their depth, and their consciousness is really a great awareness of Oneness with the Divine.<br>
<b>To be one with the Divine is the greatest blessing for human beings.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"I have to tell ... I'll have to tell you the story about the Sahasrāra Day, about which it was decided, long time back, before I incarnated. They had a big meeting in the Heavens, all the thirty-five karoṛs [350 millions] of Gods, the Deities were there present to decide what is to be done. <b>'This is the ultimate that we have to do to human beings: is to open their Sahasrāra, to open their awareness to the Spirit, to the Real Knowledge of the Divine, to remove the darkness of ignorance.'</b> And it had to be spontaneous because it has to work the living force of God. Also, it had to be very quick. So all the Gods requested that now, I, the Ādi Śhakti has to take the birth.<br>
They all tried Their best. They did whatever was possible. The Saints were made by Them but very few. They incarnated and people made religions out of Them which were perverted, brought Them bad name. No reality in those religions. These religions were money-oriented or power-oriented. There was no Divine Force working, actually, it was all anti-Divine."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"<b>Just to say, ‘Mother, it’s all Yours,’ to start it – 'It’s all Yours.<br>
I am Yours, my heart is Yours, all my things are Yours, my life is Yours.'<br>
Even saying that is a big mantra for Sahasrāra.</b><br>
The deity of Sahasrāra is a very simple person, extremely simple, and can be moved with very little actions,<br>
can be pleased with very few little actions here and there.<br>
Not much is needed to please the deity of Sahasrāra.<br>
It’s a very simple person. Little things make Her happy."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"It has been such a great pleasure and glorification of Sahaja Yoga today, I remember the day when it started, on the 5th May 1970. And today I see all of you so much engulfed in the Divine Love and Divine Power.<br>
<b>The whole thing shows one very great, fundamental thing, of Sahasrāra: that people from so many countries integrated together.</b><br>
Integrated. It was Sahaj, spontaneous, but every way and there was no confusion, there’s no quarreling, no fighting, nothing. Such an integration, spontaneous, whether it is on the stage or stage of life.<br>
Now, as we are all global personalities, we are all integrated and those who were acting were enjoying as well as the ones who were looking at them were also enjoying in the same manner.<br>
It was such a good also integration between the one who was acting, or the all those who were there, and all those who were watching – I couldn’t understand whether the people who are seeing them are also acting, or also those who are acting are also seeing.<br>
It was a beautiful blending I must say, and I congratulate all the leaders of all these five countries, who have contributed so well to this deep sense of integration.<br>
Not that is the integration within that is important – of course that’s very important for a personality, but for our work, for our global emancipation we need integration of all the nations, and understanding of all the nations, because these barriers are created by human beings, not by God Almighty.<br>
So we have transcended those barriers, and the way we are all sitting together in a complete integrated mood is – you don’t know what your Mother feels, I, I just can’t believe that in such a short time this we have achieved, in My lifetime I can see all these things happening.<br>
So it was such a beautiful sahaja, spontaneous, creation of the Spirit of this integration, and I congratulate all the leaders for this, and we all should thank them, for giving us this beautiful integrated, Sahaj spontaneous illustration of [the] Sahaj character.<br>
Thank you very much.<br>
May God bless you all."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today we are celebrating the Sahasrāra Day.<br>
Perhaps we have not realized what a day it must have been.<br>
<b>Without opening the Sahasrāra, God Itself was a myth, religion itself was a myth,<br>
all talk about Divinity was a myth.</b><br>
People believed in it but it was just a belief. And the science, as it was put forward,<br>
was about to obliterate all the value system, all the proof of God Almighty."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>When we enter into the Realm of Sahasrāra, then only we have [a] right to do the Sahasrāra Pūjā.</b> Before this nobody talked about Sahasrāra, nobody did any Pūjā to Sahasrār. This is your privilege that you are in the Realm of Sahasrāra and that you can do this Pūjā, perform it, is your right, you are chosen for this. It’s a very privileged place for you to enter into the Sahasrāra of the Virāṭ, to reside in the brain as cells of that Sahasrāra.<br>
Let us see what is the quality of the cells of Sahasrāra. These are specially created cells through the working of the Swādhiṣhṭhāna. Passing through all the chakras, when they arrive at Sahasrāra they are equipped to handle the brain’s activity without getting involved into other elements in the body.<br>
In the same way, the Sahaja Yogis are not to be involved in the other cells, human beings, of the body of this Universe."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So after so many days, the Sahasrāra has been opened out. We have to open out our Sahasrāra again.<br>
Through our meditative processes, through understanding ourselves and others, maybe logically reaching that point: ‘There’s no way out now. We have reached to the end of it now. The whole logic has ended up now. Jump in the Ocean of Love. Finished!'<br>
<b>Once you jump in the Ocean of Love there’s nothing to be done! Just to be enjoyed: every wave of it, every hue of it, every touch of it. That is what one has to learn by reasoning that, ‘Sahaja Yoga is nothing but is Love.'</b><br>
May God bless you all."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Sahaja Yoga is the power of compassion and love of God Almighty.

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today's Pūjā is very important</b>, because I feel Western countries have gone off with their ego, and they need Buddha very much, and they like also this so-called Buddhism very much, because you see, they can then just hide behind that camouflage. "We are Buddhist, you see." They'll worry about Afghanistan and they'll worry about lama. They'll worry about all other people, because, 'You see, we are Buddhist.' But there's no truth in it, no truth.<br> 
<b>Sahaja Yogis have to establish that truth, that dedication.<br>
So Buddha has said: "Buddham śharaṇaṃ gacchāmi." ``I bow to all those who are realized Souls." "Dhammam śharaṇaṃ gacchāmi." "I bow myself, to my dharma," that is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma. And then lastly is: "Saṅghaṃ śharaṇaṃ gacchāmi." "I bow to collectivity."</b>"</font><br>
