<font color="DarkRed">"<b>"The Devī incarnated on this Earth to kill the demonic personalities who try to destroy all the good qualities of women.<br>
We also have those demonic personalities within us and they are to be destroyed -- not physically, but mentally.</b><br>
How you accept them and how you deal with whatever they try is very surprising.<br>
You must understand that the goodness of a person is very important. If you are trying to be nasty or dominating then you'll be definitely destroyed. That's why this Devī has come on the Earth. That is the assurance of this Devī, the Goddess."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"And that is why, <b>today is the day when the Virgin, Gaurī, sat down to worship Śhiva. She made a Śhiva Lingua and was sitting and putting Her sindūr on that: "That you look after this, which is the mark of my Union with you. I leave it to you, to look after" -- to Śhiva. "You look after me. I surrender to you."</b> With this, <b>that's how Gaurī your Kuṇḍalinī surrenders to the Spirit: 'Now You look after this connection.</b> I forget everything else. I leave it into Your hands. Lift Me up. You raise Me up. I forget all that was Me before. Everything I have dropped out. No other desire. But just lift Me higher and higher. Make Me Yourself. The rest of it is not important. All other manifestations of this, desires are over. Now, I am absolutely surrendered to You, My Spirit. Lift Me higher and higher. Higher and higher, away from all the things that were not the Spirit. Make Me complete Spirit, full Spirit.' "</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Now first of all you get your Realization, all right. Now you must know that Kuṇḍalinī Itself is the Mahākālī Śhakti because She's the Primordial. <b>Mahākālī Śhakti is the Primordial Śhakti within us. And is the Kuṇḍalinī is the Mahākālī Śhakti. And She remains as a virgin within you. Means She's purity: She has a power to purify. All that happens when you get your Realization. She starts manifesting Her all beautiful aspects on you.</b>
Now the one who is sitting there is Śhrī Gaṇeśh. Now people don't understand what is innocence is. Śhrī Gaṇeśha is sitting there and He is the One who presides [pronounced as prĭsīds] all Mūlādhāra, even over His Mother, because He's like a guard."</font><br>

<p style=" text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"But Goddess Herself has done so many things for us already, within us, though we are not aware of it. Is said that, <b>"Yā Devī sarvabhūteśhu"</b>: "All those whom You have created," means mostly the human beings, "What do You do? As what do You exist inside the human beings?"<br>
Now, just introspect if you have these qualities within you or not, because they are given to you by the Goddess, by the Śhakti within you."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So sincerity, though it is the quality of the left side, can be dominated by the right side, this way.<br>
The second thing about your desire, that it should be a pure desire. And the pure desire is very simple for you because I'm sitting before you. <b>The pure desire of a seeker is to see God, to be in the company of God, to be uh in association with God. As they call it Sālokya, Sāmīpya and Sanīḍya [Sanīḍa]: there are three words describing this.</b><br>
Va [but] without asking, without thinking of it, you have been given the fourth dimension called as the Tādātmya [sameness of nature]: means becoming one with My body, My being. So, that you become protected, absolutely cleansed and nourished in My being. But when you are not aware of it, then what happens: that I have to suffer in My body to cleanse you. So all other desires can create problems within you. "</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Mahākālī is the left side power in us. So, actually She is Ādi Śhakti. Only <b>when She enters into the left side of the Virāṭa we call Her Mahākālī, but She is the Power of Pure Desire of God. Then She establishes Śhrī Gaṇeśha Herself</b>. Then She goes to the right side as Mahāsaraswatī, and then She enters into the center [navel] where She is Mahālakṣhmī. That is how Ādi Śhakti takes three forms. But Mahākālī is the pure form, because She's not yet deep in [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] I mean from Ādi Śhakti, She's Mahākālī. So first thing She, before creating this universe or anything, She created Śhrī Gaṇeśha. And first to spread, manifest not only holiness but also auspiciousness, and purity. So before anything was created, these spiritual forces were created, to protect the creation that was to follow. So this Mahākālī force was specially in the purest form to protect people from the negative side."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>The first destroying factor that is within us is the Śhrī Gaṇeśha's Power and this Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the Power of Mahākālī.</b><br>
She first planted Śhrī Gaṇeśha to emit holiness on this Earth, so the whole thing could be vibrated and as you know one aspect of Śhrī Gaṇeśha is also Oṃkāra, means this vibratory awareness which flows everywhere.<br>
So these vibrations have four sites in it: one is that <b>these vibrations establish holiness, auspiciousness through Mahākālī; then these same vibrations also comfort us through Mahākālī Power<b>. Vibrations do not give you desires as such, if you see, they do not give you desires, but they give you proof of your desires in fulfillment."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"You cannot make anyone brahmachārī or brahmachāriṇī. It is a state, avasthā, where a person has to rise, like Yogeśhwara, like Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br>
......<br>
It is a state of mind where you are not involved. It is a different thing, that you just load somebody with an idea that You should become, absolutely a brahmachārī or a brahmachāriṇī or you should lead a celibate life, forcing them.<br>
