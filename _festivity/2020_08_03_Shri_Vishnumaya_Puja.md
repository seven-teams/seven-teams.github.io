<font color="DarkRed">"With Sahaja Yoga you can do many many things, but you must know what you can do. For that, <b>Kṛiṣhṇa is a very good example. He started Sahaj Culture. Culture, I'm saying – he didn't give Realization to anyone, but he gave the idea of Sahaj Culture.</b><br>
......<br>
So He's the One who started Sahaj Culture. He said, "Let us enjoy." We must have enjoyment, Nirmala Ānand: pure joy. How do we have pure joy by? He had this rākhī bandhan by which, apart from your wife, everybody is your sister or mother.<br>
<br>
I must say it is quite true about Indians. Not in the north so much because of Islamic influence, but in the south it is so. In Maharashtra it is so.<br>
<br>
And then He started also this Holī, in which you should play with colors, maybe to get rid of the color barriers we have, maybe.<br>
<br>
In America it is a very good idea to play with colors and put some black on the Whites and some whites on the Black and they can see for themselves how stupid it is to fight in the name of color."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>Yā Devī sarvabhūteśhu, Viṣhṇumāyeti shabditā </b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>The most important function of the Viśhuddhi chakra is that it should be pure and clean because if you have to say mantras your Viśhuddhi has to be clean.</b> All the mantras have to have the help of Viśhuddhi. When a guru gives a mantra, first thing you’ll find he will have a left Viśhuddhi catch and any other chakra whatever the chakra the guru has attacked. But first will be on the left Viśhuddhi, so for that we use the mantra of mantrasiddhi. The <b>mantrasiddhi comes on a person when his left Viśhuddhi is all right, otherwise he cannot be mantrasiddhi<b>. Whatever mantras they say is all mechanical. Your left Viśhuddhi should be all right if you have to say the mantras in a proper way to be effective to have enlightened mantras. Even ‘Allah hu Akbar’ has no meaning if your left Viśhuddhi is not all right. So you will see how, in Sahaja Yoga, left Viśhuddhi is important and right Viśhuddhi is important for vibrations.<br>
So Viśhuddhi chakra plays a tremendous part, role in, in Sahaja Yoga because it connects you to the Virāṭ, to the Whole."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>In our Sahaja Yoga, the significance of left wrist is that it is the left Viśhuddhi.</b> Left Viśhuddhi which is here. And this is the left Viśhuddhi expressed here, you know that very well. Now, left Viśhuddhi is the place where our relationship of brothers and sisters exist. When they are disturbed within us, we start getting the problem of the left Viśhuddhi. In these modern times, to talk of pure relationship seems to be quite boring for many people. But is very practical and logical. I would say it is the most scientific thing to do.<br>
For example, every brother has a special feeling for a sister, and her chastity is very dear to every brother, if he is a normal person. If he’s abnormal, then forget it. But normally, a brother is very particular about the chastity of the sister, and he doesn’t like anybody to, in any way, even pass a remark against the chastity of a sister."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today in India, we celebrate a set ... special festival. <b>It is called as Rakṣhā-bandhan. Rakṣhā means protection and bandhan means the bondage: the bondage of protection. Is a very nice, good, social custom to have this beautiful festival today.</b><br>
<b>Today is the Full Moon Day, and this day what we do is to tie a band of threads around the person whom you want to protect.</b> But it is done between brothers and sisters. The sisters tie this bondage to the wrist of the brothers, and when they do that, they are putting all their love around the wrist, that it is the day for giving all their love, everything to their brother, as a protection, as a symbol of their protection through that thread. Is a very, very simple thread they use. And uh this is, has to be tied on the left-hand side. But people tie it on the right-hand side, which is a mistake. But it has to be tied on the left-hand side."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"This Viṣhṇumāyā is the one who has helped
you because <b>She is the Sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa</b>, and because this is the domain of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, She came down here to help you.<br>
Now She’s the Sister -- this must be understood very well. Now sisterly relation is a pure relationship."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>Auṃ Twameva sākshāt Śhrī Pāvitrya dāyinī sākshāt<br>
Śhrī Ādi Śhakti Mātājī Śhrī Nirmalā Devyai namo namaḥ!</b></font><br>
O Divine Mother, You are verily the One who gives chastity, the foundation of all dharmas. Salutations to You! 
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now Viṣhṇumāyā’s Power is very important to understand, because Mother Power is to protect your innocence, because that is the most important thing. To protect your innocence is the Mother’s Power.</b><br>
Now, Viṣhṇumāyā’s Power is to protect your chastity. You don’t understand sometimes what is chastity and what is innocence. Innocence is a power which is not acted upon. Like we have electricity in our house, the electricity exists like innocence exists within us; but enactment of that is done through chastity.<br>
A person can say, “I did this very innocently” – no, he cannot. Because whatever you do if it is innocent, cannot be harmful to your character, to your innocence or to your righteousness.<br>
So those people who say like this, that “I did it innocently” are wrong, because innocently if you do anything it becomes chastity. So when innocence is practiced it becomes chastity. You must have respect of your chastity. <b>Chastity is the one which is Viṣhṇumāyā’s Power within us, Gaurī’s Power, is the pure virgin.</b><br>
......<br>
Now to understand the significance of chastity within us, we have to know that <b>chastity is the foundation of all dharmas</b>. Unless and until you have sense of chastity you cannot have dharma. Dharma is not possible because that’s the foundation. It will be a house of cards; if you do not have the foundation of chastity it will just collapse in no time."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now our Viṣhṇumāyā Principle is to be always kept very alert because it helps us in many ways.</b> First of all it helps us to pass the messages from your heart to your head. It is the one by which we integrate.<br>
Our heart and head is integrated by the Viṣhṇumāyā Principle more than the Viśhuddhi on the right side. Viśhuddhi on the right side can create collectivity, can create understanding with each other but on the left side it helps you to keep a complete integration between your heart and your head.<br>
If there is a guilt you just think of it and analyze it. It means that there’s a struggle between you in your heart and your mind, isn’t it? Simple as that. If it was integrated you would not feel guilty. And that is why all these artificial theories that have come, all these artificial yarns that you have read and all that, you forget it.<br>
<b>You are a Sahaja Yogi and you have entered into the Kingdom of God – enjoy! That’s all you have to do. But you have to get to that state of enjoyment and understanding that you are above all.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="blue">You are my brothers and sisters<br>
Because you are human,<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So now here, Viṣhṇumāyā is the one who is the virgin. Not only that She is the virgin, but She exists in all the five elements as shown that She married five Pāṇḍavas and that this power of virginity in Her used to expose people to the dangers of these horrible Kauravas who were going to rule and destroy the dharma. So She stood back and She is the one who said that "You have to fight. You have to fight for dharma, whatever may happen” and Kṛiṣhṇa always supported Her.<br>
So as a brother, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa supported Her, so the relationship between brother and sister are very important in India. Also should be with Sahaja Yogis because we have Rākhī Bandhan. You also have what you call the Bhāī Dūj where on Diwālī day we tie up a rākhī to the Brother. <b>Now this rākhī is nothing but the Viṣhṇumāyā’s Power, which protects the brother. Actually, there the brother protected Her and now the sister’s love protects the brother. So the relationship between brother and sister is much more important than any other relationship because it’s so pure, it’s so protective, it’s so loving and also it is of an equal age.</b>"</font><br>
