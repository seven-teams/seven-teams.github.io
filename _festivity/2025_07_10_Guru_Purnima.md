<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Today is a great day, for all of us, because we are celebrating the Guru Pūjā and remembering all the Great Gurus who came on Earth to teach the world about the Truth.</b> So many of Them were here. And They tried Their level best to explain to humanity what is spirituality.<br>
But is such a disparity that people never understood that spirituality is the most important thing we need, that we have to be one with the Divine Power.<br>
All their endeavor[s] have been in the wrong direction.<br>
First, of course, they were very intelligent, more than animals, and started seeking, not the Truth, but some sort of a self-emancipation I should say or I don't know what to say, call it, self-progress. And in that they lost that they have to first seek spirituality, which is the most important thing."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is the day of Guru Pūrṇimā. It is a Full Moon Day. That's why ... it is called as Pūrṇimā. The guru has to be like a Full Moon. Means completely grown, completely matured.</b><br>
......<br>
Any born realized Soul cannot do it on its own: it has to have authority of Me, as I am today.<br>
That's why <b>it was said that, "Guru is a person who makes you meet God": he raises the Kuṇḍalinī and makes you one with God.</b><br>
Because in those days when the gurus were self-realized, ...... when the gurus were self-real... -realized, they had the authority and power of raising the Kuṇḍalinī only after they had reached a very great state of evolution: complete purification, complete detachment."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>The meaning of guru word is very large. This must be understood.<br>
Today I want to talk on this issue: who is a guru and who is not.</b><br>
The obvious meaning of guru means the one who is bigger than us, the one who is sitting at a place higher than us. As the water collected at a height spontaneously flows down, it is also eager to find a surface for itself, and to bring everyone to its surface. You keep water to a certain height; it will be willing to [{\bf{\textcolor{amber+}{unclear}}}] everyone. This is the very meaning of guru.<br>
The one who is not that kind is not a guru.<br>
He is above us in every matter, not just in one matter.<br>
That is why we people who are wandering in street to street believing in guru should remember that the number of gurus is in thousands. The guru who talks of the Absolute Principle is a real guru. Those who talk of God and of God and who uplift you are real gurus.<br>
Those who make money from you are not gurus. Those who charge money for their speech, they can never be gurus.<br>
Because the speech which has come from God is a precious thing, the value of which you just cannot give.<br>
The day when you give value of it then that thing cannot be of God. You cannot go and purchase God from market.<br>
Remember, today we are confronting thousands of such people who are making money in the name of God. Nothing can be bigger injustice and meanness than this. If there is any article, substance or a thing in this world which is equal to the kick of the feet of the God, then we can say that we are watching God."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is a day people's ... this is created by human beings and not by God, as Guru Pūrṇimā. Because, as God has created days of Their advent, human beings have created days of their surrendering. So this is the day when you have to give something to the Guru, and Guru does not have to give anything to you.</b> This is the [laughing:] time you have to say: 'What you are going to give? What you are going to do for your Guru?' Because so far the Guru has been giving.<br>
If you are in meditation, supposing you say, 'We'll meditate because Guru Pūrṇimā is there,' that's not the way the Guru Pūrṇimā is to be celebrated. Because if you meditate, you are taking from Me. If you try to correct yourself, you are taking from Me. If you are going to get cured, you are taking from Me.<br>
So now what can you do for Me? Is the point, you have to think about it. 'What can you do?'<br>
Now I have sent the same question to India, to find ... I asked them to find out: 'What can you do for Me?'<br>
You will say: 'Mother, what can we do? After all, what are we?' That's a way of evading the issue.<br>
But if you really want to see, <b>you can do a lot! And that is what it is that: you are My witness. You are My publicity!</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>In Sahaja Yoga, the Guru Pūjā has a very different significant [significance] from any other guru pūjā. When you worship your Guru, you are also worshiping the Guru within you.</b> This is not in any other guru-disciple system, because, in you, the Guru, the Master, has been awakened. And so, when you are worshiping your Guru, then this Master within you is also worshiped, you respect it, you glorify it, you awaken it, and you manifest it.<br>
This, we have to realize: that, in Sahaja Yoga, if you are a Sahaja Yogi.<br>
Now the quality of guru, first and foremost is: that he makes you meet God. Means: he raises the Kuṇḍalinī, and establish the relation between the All-pervading Power.<br>
And, as your Guru is Ādi Śhakti, you make that person meet, also, the Ādi Śhakti.<br>
So you have a double advantage. That, at the same time, when you give them Realization, not only that you make them feel the Union with the Divine Power, but you can make them meet the Divinity Itself, the Source of Divine Power.<br>
So your responsibility as Sahaja Yogis is very great because in you is ... there is the Guru."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkGreen">"Today we have ... had to spend [a] little more time than normal to get to the stage where we could really worship the Guru.<br>
<b>When we worship our Guru, we have to know actually we are trying to awaken the Guru Principle within ourselves. Is not only that you are here to worship your Guru.</b> You may worship many a times, maybe the vibrations would flow, maybe that you might get filled by that and you feel elevated, nourished. But this nourishment has to be retained within ourselves, so always remember then, whenever you are worshiping any principle outside, you are trying to worship your own principle within yourself.<br>
Within us, as you know, in all of us there lies the Principle of Guru. Is very interesting to notice the Guru Principle being drawn beautifully round the Nābhī chakra. We never see any chakras connected with the Guru Principle. You see Nābhī, and around is the Bhavasāgara. So this Bhavasāgara which is the Ocean of Illusion cannot be the Guru. So, there are hidden chakras within this Bhavasāgara, within us, which are to be awakened and to be brought to light, to be manifested."</font><br>

I am happy today is another day of Guru Pūrṇimā which is a very auspicious day and to be regarded as a very big blessing for you because this gives you, I mean this is a certificate, that you all are capable of being gurus.<br>
<br>You have to become that, becoming is important, in Sahaja Yoga becoming is important, all other things are really of no use. You have to become.<br>
Specially ladies are very shy I think. They can do a lot and they should work it out. They are shy for nothing at all, what is the need to be shy? They are very shy ladies and they just don't get into the whole working of Sahaja Yoga -- you should. If the ladies start talking about it, I think it will work much faster.<br>
And I bless you all to do this work, which was left half done by the Saints, it's your duty to complete it.<br>
May God bless you.</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"Now today is a day when we are celebrating the Guru Pūjā. <b>The Greatest Guru that we have is Love, Sahaj Love, is the Guru within us, which teaches us, which some or other leads us.</b> We are led into that great line of understanding, for which we don't have to go to any college, to any school for education.<br>
It is something so much within that it works and expresses itself, expresses like a light. Such people we can make out because they are fully enlightened. They have light. And through that light they see the whole world, which is very innocent and simple for them.<br>
We have love for our children, naturally. We have love for our parents, naturally. We have love for some people but that love is different from what love I am telling you. That has some connections, some meanings, but this love which is ... cannot be described in words, has to be felt within.<br>
Same, <b>when you talk of your Guru, you should have that love within you. Why do you feel it so much? The reason is Guru loves you and you love Guru. That's the only reason why should you love your Guru.</b> Now there's no reason for that. Because love is love. That is how the Guru becomes very important in life. We have people who love their Guru and are very much in chaste understanding of their love.<br>
......<br>
This is what is the Guru, is that love within you, which wants to share love with others, which wants to give love to others. This is what is peace and joy."</font><br>
