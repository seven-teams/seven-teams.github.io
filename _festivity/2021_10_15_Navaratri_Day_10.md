<font color="DarkRed">"So She has created all these things just for you to be created, and ultimately to get your Self-realization; to have meaning for your life, to get connected to this All-pervading Power, to enter into the Kingdom of God. All is Her work.<br>
<b>So we can say nine times She came, and the tenth time She is supposed to give Realization to all of you. But at the tenth time, all these Three Powers are joined together – that’s why it’s called Triguṇātmika.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today we have gathered here to do the Pūjā of the Devī. The Devī has many forms, but is the Embodiment of the Śhakti.<br>
<b>Ādi Śhakti gives Śhakti to all these Embodiments and so there are many Goddesses we have.</b><br>
At different times they came on this Earth and did all that was necessary for the ascent of people who were seekers.<br>
Especially the one we know of, Jagadambā, the Durgā.<br>
She was trying to protect all the Seekers of Truth and to destroy all evil forces, because without the ascent of human beings they do not know the Truth, and that’s why whatever they try to do is a mental projection, and this mental projection, if it is not substantiated by Truth, by dharma, it declines.<br>
In Sanskrit they call it glāni. <b>When this glāni takes place, then Incarnations are born – to solve the problem.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="SaddleBrown">"<b>Now the tenth Navarātri today is to celebrate actually the Ādi Śhakti. So today we are really going to worship the Ādi Śhakti.</b> On one side the Ādi Śhakti is Mahākālī, on the other side She is Mahāsaraswatī, in the center She is Mahālakṣhmī, and also She is the Ambā, the one who is the Kuṇḍalinī. But She’s also beyond that. She’s Parāśhakti, She’s beyond all the powers because She is the Generator of Power, so She has to be beyond all that.<br>
So today when we are worshiping Her, we have to worship Her in all these forms."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"You must pray to God and ask what you want.<br>
Ask for complete satisfaction in my heart, joy in my heart, bliss in my heart, so that the whole world becomes blissful.<br>
Give me love, love that I could love the whole world and that the whole world becomes one in love.<br>
Give salvation to this humanity which is suffering.<br>
Take me to Your feet. Cleanse me with Thy love."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">""Now you enter into the Kingdom of God. Then the Śhakti makes you sit on different beautiful positions, and some are sitting in the Heart of God, some are sitting in the Sahasrāra of God, in the Kingdom of God.<br>
Now you should assume your power. On Navarātri now, you should understand that it has now crossed the limit and now we are on the tenth position, where you must assume. I have told you many a times, now believe that you are Sahaja Yogis. Believe that you are, you have entered into the Kingdom of God. You cannot judge God, you cannot say why She does that, why She does that, why He does that. You cannot say that – that’s different. But when you sit there, then it is not an assembly, it is not like a politician fighting, no; it is that you have entered into the Kingdom of God, blessed by God, looked after, protected, nourished, and made knowledgeable.<br>
...... So Navarātri’s – <b>now, the tenth day of Navarātri, which is the most important for all of you, is where this Paramachaitanya has become active. And by its activity you should know it is become very powerful, and that now anybody who tries to be nasty with you, tries to trouble you – “I don’t have to worry at all.” It will take care of it."</b></font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So then we come to this point, that Ādi Śhakti’s work is the most important work in the whole creation.<br>
All right, killing the demons was over. What is it? Done! Saraswatī’s work was done, She created universe also, so what? Mahālakṣhmī’s work was done. She brought you to human level, all right, so what? But the climax is now that you have got your Realization, that you have got this special quality, that now you have entered into the Kingdom of God. So now behave yourself. And also you must have that dignity to know that now we have entered into the Kingdom of God.<br>
...... But when you are entering into the Kingdom of God, how conscious you should be about your behavior. How you should be, how you should behave. Just feel the uniqueness of your personality, that you are in the Kingdom of God already – just feel it. If you can feel only that, then you will know what a place of pride you have got, and how dignified you should be, how beautiful you should be, how neat and clean and sweet you should be, how much maryādās you must know – everything. And when you will realize that now you are the coveted, or we can say the highest citizens of the Kingdom of God, then you have to prove that you have really realized it, that you really feel that way. And you should feel extremely joyful, happy."</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font size="+0"><b>Sahaja Yoginī: Recognize You as Ādi Śhakti.</b></font><br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī</b>: Correct. That’s it. That’s it, that’s the important point. <b>Unless and until you recognize Me spiritual progress is not possible.</b><br>
As you progress the recognition increases, it goes hand in hand, sort of thing.<br>
And this is the most difficult, very difficult problem of modern times, very difficult.<br>
Because we cannot recognize anyone unless and until he is elected or put in a position or branded.<br>
But from your heart to recognize you have to have a very sensitive spiritual attainment.<br>
It’s not a mental recognition, it’s an integrated recognition.<br>
Some may recognize Me from their hearts but will not recognize Me from their intelligence – so they’ll be fighting.<br>
Or they do not accept Me physically that one has to do certain things physically.<br>
But this recognition itself is joy-giving.<br>
Just you think, and if I have to think that, ‘I’m sitting before the Ādi Śhakti, I would be so very happy, and I’ll bless my soul, that oh God, this is what has happened to me, what have I done so great?’<br>
So that recognition when it comes in it disciplines you in Sahaja Yoga, completely.</b></font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Now the Ādi Śhakti’s work is to give you Realization first, second is to give you life, to comfort you.<br>
If you have physical problems She will look after you, She’ll go all out. If you have mental problem She’ll try to solve. So She’s a Comforter, She gives you the comfort; at the same time She protects you."</font><br>
<font size="+0"><b>1990-0923 Navarātri Pūjā (4th Day), The Deities Are Watching You, Hall, Arzier-Le Muids, Nyon, Vaud, Switzerland</b></font>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So this is the Ādi Śhakti’s Compassion, Love and Confidence, that you should have also confidence.<br>
Not only that I have given you Realization, but I have given you powers that you can give Realizations to others. None of these Incarnations did that, which you are doing today. With all their powers they did not do it, while you can do it, despite the fact the instruments are not so strong, not so divine. But still, still we have to come up, and work out in our own lives the priorities that we have. For the Gods the priorities were only divine work, nothing else. Nobody took up a job, nobody. Nobody went to university, nobody studied. Only thing they did was the work of God.<br>
So you do everything else as work of God, and that’s how the energy will flow into you. When you start doing the work of God, everything you do becomes work of God; in the sense that you do the work of God, you decide, ‘I’m going to do the work of God,’ then God takes over. He does all the rest of the things, you do only the work of God. He takes over. I hope you understand this. Try, try, have confidence. And also thank God there is someone like your Mother who can tell you what’s wrong with you."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Last of all you have to pray that, <b>‘Mother, we should recognize our Mother.<br>
That She has come within us. We are very fortunate and we know who She is.<br>
Please give us strength so that we recognize Her and imbibe that recognition in our life.<br>
It is not only recognition, but imbibe.’</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today especially it's a very great day of Dussehra we call it. This is the day when, as you know, Rāvaṇa was burned. Effigies of Rāvaṇa are burnt all over the place. When Śhrī Rāma came this was done. His victory.</b> 
But in His victory, it was not that He made Sahaja Yogis or He gave Realization -- No! His victory was that He killed Rāvaṇa. That was done that time for today's preparation, for today's happenings. It was done long time back that these days will come when people will have a proper value system of the victory of Śhrī Rāma. But it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen, because this Incarnation of Mātājī Nirmalā Devī is very different, is very illusive -- Mahāmāyā.<br>
......<br>
So now, I have to just tell you that, on this day of this Pūjā, it's such a combination that it's the Dussehra, I am here and also you can call it the last day of the Devī Pūjā."</font><br>
