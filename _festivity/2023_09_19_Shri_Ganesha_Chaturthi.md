<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we have gathered here to do Śhrī Gaṇeśha Pūjā.<br>
The first Deity that was created by the Ādi Śhakti was Śhrī Gaṇeśh, because it was necessary first to create the Deity of Principles.</b> The Deity of Principle in the sense that whatever is created, whatever is there, has [been] called bhava, whatever has been so far created up to human level, everything, had to be through the implanted mechanism of energy. Otherwise nothing could have been create[d]."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Gaṇeśh is the first Deity that got established and similarly the situation of Gaṇeśh is same as that of Mahākālī. This is the seed and the whole world emanates from this seed and again gets merged with it. Similarly, everything after emanating from the Gaṇeśh Tattwa merges with Gaṇeśh Tattwa itself. Whatever exists, Gaṇeśh is the seed of that. Whatever appears in front of us, in action, in desire, Gaṇeśh is the seed of it. That is why Gaṇeśh is considered the foremost main Deity.<br>
Not only that, without worshipping Śhrī Gaṇeśh, we cannot do any work. Then they may be Śhaiva [Śhaivites], may be Vaiṣhṇav, may be devotees of Śhrī Brahma or anybody else, all of them first worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha. The reason for this is that Śhrī Gaṇeśh Tattwa was established by God Almighty as the first thing in this Universe.<br>
The Gaṇeśh Principle is what we call as abodhita [ignorant of wrong behavior] or what we call as innocence in English. This is a very subtle principle. We do not understand it. In childhood it exists in the children, everywhere we see its expression, its fragrance, wafting all over -- that is why small children are so lovable -- such is the Principle of Innocence. It is present in Śhrī Gaṇeśha."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today, we are going to worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha.<br>
As you know, in the whole of Europe, America, England, they have lost faith in Śhrī Gaṇeśha. Nor do they care for His Powers and for His blessings. As result, all His blessings are not on these countries.<br>
<b>The first blessing of Śhrī Gaṇeśha, which is, I think is the highest, is the wisdom</b>, that we learn what is good for us and what is bad for us, what is constructive and what is destructive, what should we do to achieve our Self-realization. Those people who have got wisdom are very lucky people.<br>
But wisdom comes from no source but your own understanding of life."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the Deity of Innocence.</b><br>
When we are born as children, it is Śhrī Gaṇeśha who is acting and we are very innocent, and it is such a powerful thing that, with this innocence, children survive under many circumstances. And we love them, because they are innocent. We enjoy them, because they are innocent.<br>
Once we start growing, our Sahasrāra also gets closed and we develop all kinds of funny things that enters into us and doesn't go out. It's just there, it doesn't go out.<br>
Innocence has a great effect on our character and on our sense of chastity. Actually, when you are innocent, you don't know what is not chastity, what is being unchaste, what is being cunning. You are innocent and you are looked after by Śhrī Gaṇeśha Himself."</font><br>

<p style=" text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"Today, we have gathered here to worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha.<br>
<b>You all know what a powerful Deity He is. His Power comes from His innocence.</b><br>
When we see small children, we [are] automatically compelled towards them and also we want to love them, kiss them and be with us [them]. And very innocent they are, extremely innocent.<br>
And when we worship Śhrī Gaṇeśh we have to know if we have been really innocent or not."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Innocence is the sustainance [sustenance], is the basis of spirituality. If a person doesn't have innocence, we [he] cannot rise in spirituality.<br>
That's why the first job of Sahaja Yoga is to establish Śhrī Gaṇeśha within you, to awaken Him. As soon as the Kuṇḍalinī awakens, you must know that Śhrī Gaṇeśha comes into being. Without His awakening within you, Kuṇḍalinī cannot be raised. But it could be temporary, or it could be a permanent thing.<br>
It could be very temporary with people who are not yet adjusted to the new method or to the Ways of God's Love. Those who have not understood, or those who have not gone through those traditions, is rather difficult for them to establish Śhrī Gaṇeśha within them. "</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the first Deity that was created so that the whole Universe is filled with auspiciousness, with peace, bliss, and spirituality. He is the Source. He's the Source of Spirituality. As a result of that all other things follow. Like when it rains and is windy you feel a coolness in the atmosphere. In the same way when Śhrī Gaṇeśha emits His Power we feel all these three things within and without. But it has been so unfortunate, specially in the West, that the most important fundamental Deity has been completely not only neglected, but insulted and crucified.<br>
So today though I did not want to say anything to upset you people, but I must tell you that worshiping Śhrī Gaṇeśha means there has to be a thorough cleansing within you. When you worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha keep your mind clean, keep your heart clean, keep your being clean -- no thoughts of lust and greed should come up. Actually when the Kuṇḍalinī rises Gaṇeśha had to be awakened within us, the innocence has to come up -- which obliterates all such degrading ideas within us. If ascent has to be achieved, we have to understand that we have to mature."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"So today's Pūjā is specially to be done with a prayer in your heart that: 'Śhrī Gaṇeśha, please be kind and merciful and forgiving that You manifest within ourselves. Let all these hypocritical things, all these conditionings and all these wrong ideas we have or all the wrong life we have had, should just disappear like thin air, and let the beautiful moonlight of your soothing qualities of innocence be manifested through us.'<br>
Let us manifest these qualities. This is what is to be asked."</b></font><br>
