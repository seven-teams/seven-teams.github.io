<font color="DarkRed">"So the relationship between Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa and Viṣhṇumāyā is that of a brother and a sister.<br>
And surprisingly, the other day we celebrated the Rākhī Bandhan, the Rakṣhābandhan, which is the same thing as the brothers-sisters relationship.<br>
So now here we are celebrating actually the Deity which is the Sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br>
Later on She was born as Draupadī. And that's why Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa went to save Her chastity, because is the brother only who is concerned about the chastity and the name of the sister."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Now, <b>the Indian Sahaja Yogis have sent Me three rākhīs</b>. This was by somebody else, but three of them, which is a very, very ... another very poetical situation. That, M... Modi has written that, "You are the protection for all of us. And a how ... what do we do ah to put this onto You? And what are we doing it?"<br>
So, they said that: <b>"All the sisters of Sahaja Yogis are sending this to be tied on all the brothers of Sahaja Yoginīs who are in Your wrist."</b><br>
<b>And that's how they've sent three -- of Mahākālī, Mahālakṣhmī, Mahāsaraswatī</b> -- three things which I will ask one of the child to come and do it because it is the work of a small little child, ......"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Rākhī is Protecting Power.</b> Its bond is very strong and extremely tender because it symbolizes the noble love of sister. Customarily, tying a rākhī to someone is establishing a place of Pure Protection. However, man's ability to understand love has become so feeble that tying of rākhī has become merely a mechanical process. All beautiful human traditions become lifeless and dry formalities if there is no warmth of faith in them.<br>
......<br>
<b>Rākhī Pūrṇimā is a day of great significance. On that day you should ask for perfection, make big decisions and keep attention on high ideals.</b> Sahaja Yogis should not destroy their attention on trifle issues. Lot of work has yet to be done."</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Today in India, we celebrate a set ... special festival. <b>It is called as Rakṣhā-bandhan. Rakṣhā means protection and bandhan means the bondage: the bondage of protection. Is a very nice, good, social custom to have this beautiful festival today.</b><br>
<b>Today is the Full Moon Day, and this day what we do is to tie a band of threads around the person whom you want to protect.</b> But it is done between brothers and sisters. The sisters tie this bondage to the wrist of the brothers, and when they do that, they are putting all their love around the wrist, that it is the day for giving all their love, everything to their brother, as a protection, as a symbol of their protection through that thread. Is a very, very simple thread they use. And uh this is, has to be tied on the left-hand side. But people tie it on the right-hand side, which is a mistake. But it has to be tied on the left-hand side."</font><br>

<font color="blue">"<b>So, this day is uh extremely important, in a way, for Sahaja Yogis to observe, and I'm happy that I am here, because it's very important also for America.</b><br>
Uh as I told you that, I have already talked to you how the-ee war between Alexander and Puru's was finished because of a sister's intervention.<br>
And, also, how Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, whose sister was Draupadī, Viṣhṇumāyā was born as Draupadī, and how He came to save Her chastity, by rushing all the way from Dvārika.<br>
So, we can see that when we ascend in the Collective Consciousness and we have collective living, collective meeting, at the Viśhuddhi chakra, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa establish[ed] this, or He manifested uh this pure relationship of a sister.<br>
In a collective life that we have, in the Āśhram where we live, where we move about as Sahaja Yogis, if we do not have this basic principle within us, there will be a chaos, complete chaos. Once this purity of relationship is established, that apart from my wife, all the rest are my sisters or mothers, it cannot be a proper society and <b>the chaos of the social system of America is because they have no sense of pure relationships.<br>
Once you call somebody a sister, she's a sister. And once you call somebody a brother, she's [he's] a brother. It's not only that you should be born of the same parents, it's not necessary, but this is a very important principle to have a very pure society where everybody can live peacefully.</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>In our Sahaja Yoga, the significance of left wrist is that it is the left Viśhuddhi.</b> Left Viśhuddhi which is here. And this is the left Viśhuddhi expressed here, you know that very well.<br>
Now, left Viśhuddhi is the place where our relationship of brothers and sisters exist. When they are disturbed within us, we start getting the problem of the left Viśhuddhi.<br>
In these modern times, to talk of pure relationship seems to be quite boring for many people. But is very practical and logical. I would say it is the most scientific thing to do.<br>
For example, every brother has a special feeling for a sister, and her chastity is very dear to every brother, if he is a normal person. If he's abnormal, then forget it. But normally, a brother is very particular about the chastity of the sister, and he doesn't like anybody to, in any way, even pass a remark against the chastity of a sister."</font><br>
