<font color="DarkRed">"Today we are celebrating here a special day called Makar Saṅkrānt. For the information of the foreign Sahaja Yogis, I will explain to you what it means.<br>
......<br>
It means the day, today is the day the Sun crosses over from the Tropic of Capricorn to the Tropic of Cancer. It is a very big day for us because, now during the summertime we have the harvest, and we look forward to the rain and so many things that happen in every country. The Sun falls at right angles in this country during the summer season and so we welcome the Sun. We eat something -- that you must have eaten already -- what we call as tīḷ and jaggery. It is to prepare your body and your mind to give it sufficiency to receive the Sun. Because if you are living in the cool season, then all your body, mind becomes lethargic and you become also sometimes very lazy about things in the sense, that the day is so small, that you cannot achieve many results. So the body has become cold as we call it. We take these things, which give us heat so body is prepared to receive the heat of the Sun to welcome."</font><br>

<font color="orange">"Now the Sun is so much respected in this country,<br>
that in early morning time all the people get up and say namas-kārs to Sūrya with all His names<br>
and do a particular type of exercise to show that they are completely surrendered to the will of the Sūrya."</font>

<font color="DarkRed">"The meaning of Makar Saṅkrānti is saṅkramaṇ, that is, the day that brings about some change. <b>On this day the Sun starts its movement toward the Northern Hemisphere. In India, all the festivals are according to the position of the Moon. That’s why their dates are different in different years. Makar Saṅkrānti is based on the position of the Sun and that is the reason this festival is celebrated every year on fourteenth January.</b><br>
Makar Saṅkrānti indicates the day when the Sun becomes warmer. The heat of the Sun is benevolent for the human race. It is because of this heat that we can walk, we can talk. The heat of the Sun makes a human being angry. This is the reason why we take jaggery on this day so that we talk sweetly. The heat of the Sun is responsible for all the vegetation and wealth of the Earth. On this day we offer fruits and vegetables to the Devī and receive Her blessings. With the blessings of Ādi Śhakti the earth element cools down and the human race progresses."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen"><b>This special day today is a day of Saṅkrān-ta. Saṅkri you know, saṅ means good, holy, and krānt means ......<br>
Revolution! Holy revolution. Holy.</b> And that’s what I’m telling them.<br>
What is the Holy Revolution is? <b>That your own dharma is established now through Sahaja Yoga. You know what is your dharma.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today is Saṅkrānti. <b>Saṅkrānti means that today there is something new going to happen. Kuṇḍalinī has awakened within you and you have become a new person compared to what you were before. But on the day of Saṅkrānti, you should know that you have to please the Goddess who is sitting within you.</b><br>
What should you do to make Her happy? You distributed sesame seeds and jaggery. That is for love. To increase the love between each other, we give sesame seeds and jaggery.<br>
Today the Sun left its place and, in its northward movement, came towards us. At this moment we should be very thankful to the Sun. It is by the grace of the Sun that so many things take place in our country. <b>We have to do namaskār to the Sun today and His Power and His knowledge should come to us.</b><br>
I would say that all of you have become realized and vibrations are flowing through you. Now you should make use of these vibrations, establish the śhakti within you, establish the peace within you and show the world that this power is within us and we have to acquire it. We have to nurture this, improve this with your good qualities and truthful speech."</font><br>

Sun power means self-confidence. Sun gives us heat and light.<br>

or gain self-confidence from the light of the Sun and become radiant.<br>
Eternal blessings to all of you."</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is the day they give you a sweet thing to say that: ‘You must speak sweetly,’ which is very important for Western people.</b> That when you are doing and organizing, you become heated up, there’s tension and you develop the temperament which is dry, emotionless, you know the heart goes into a tantrum. At that time, they say that, ‘You take the sweet.’<br>
This sweet is a heated thing because now the Sun is moving towards the other side. That time, also they, to give it a balance, they say: ‘Speak very sweetly. Use sweet words, use sweetness. Bring sweetness in your language.’ Which is very important, you understand that.<br>
And this is one of the religions we have to accept: that we will not use harsh words to each other, and then later on to others."</font><br>

And to give Realization to people as many as possible.<br>
You have to think what is your mind doing. There are many people who are waiting to come in Sahaja Yoga.<br>
