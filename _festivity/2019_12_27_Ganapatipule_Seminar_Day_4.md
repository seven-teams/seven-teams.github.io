<font color="DarkRed">"So the first thing that was said about Christ throughout in all these music and songs you have heard now is that ‘Peace on Earth’: He came to create peace on Earth.<br>
That’s only possible when you are in balance, first of all, secondly when you are realized. Both things should be there. If only you get your  Realization and there is no balance in you, there cannot be peace.<br> 
But peace never means, in any way, is a personality that recedes back, runs away from situations, escapists, it does not want to face the reality -- never means that.
Christ is pictured very differently from what He was. He was the strongest personality which [unclear], and the healthiest man who ever lived.<br> 
And He would not stand any nonsense: nobody could take liberties with Him. But He would not Himself take liberties with others, of course no question. Extremely compassionate, extremely kind but very powerful. This is the balancing."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">You are peace.<br>
You absorb all thought.<br>
You abide in the Ādi Āgñyā Chakra.<br>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"We are creating a beautiful manger for Christ, to create the peace on Earth. We have to be peaceful! To be peaceful one has to be humble. This is this [the] <b>message of Christ: humble. If we become humble peace will come.</b><br>
Humble is a good word, I don’t know if it explains what it means.<br>
Humble means not asking for your own comfort but comfort of others."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Now, another point was that you are going to go to that peace mission or something. What peace? What is that supposed to be? .... Peace festival, all right.<br>
<b>You know that peace is nothing without. It is within yourself and if you can feel your peace, then only you can start feeling peace for others. Sahaja Yoga is the only way; there’s no other way out.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">Auṃ Twameva sākshāt Śhrī Śhāntā sākshāt<br>

<b>O Divine Mother, You are verily Silence and Peace.<br>
Salutations to You!</b></font><br>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Now one has to also understand that to achieve peace is not to run away from reality.<br>
<b>Reality itself is peace, but if you are on the periphery then you cannot feel the peace</b>, but if you are on the axis, the axis is the peace. But supposing at the periphery you find by any chance there is peace, you are standing at the periphery and suddenly you become peaceful then that means you are driven out of even the periphery. So one should be very cautious about Āgñyā chakra."</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">We bow to the One who is the only son of His virgin mother<br> 
in whose every pore galaxies whirl as dust,<br>
who was born to teach us of His father Sadāśhiva, the everlasting God Almighty,<br>
Amen.</font>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So, they say `Merry Christmas' is enjoyment for joy. Out of peace comes the joy, the light of joy, the happiness.<br> 
I wish peace for the whole world</b>, the whole nation, to understand to give up all the strives, all the false battles, for money and for power, all wrong ideas that they are different from each other, and come under the banner of Sahaja Yoga and enter into the Kingdom of God, where they are invited with all respect and love.
<b>I wish peace to all of them, to all the countries, all the human beings: in their families, in their hearts, with their children, with all of them. Let there be peace, let their heart emit peace, their tongues speak with peace, their eyes see nothing but peace.</b><br>
All this has to change, tremendous change has to take place. The whole universe has to take a different turn: all that is hatred, hateful, ugly, has to vanish, and the peace has to prevail, which is not the peace of the dead but peace of the living, that has to come, of the wise.<br>
I bless all of you to be the channels of that peace, to be beautiful channels of that peace, to be glorious channels of that peace, to be great children of your Mother, who is so proud of you.<br>
May God bless you."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"There’s a mantra for the Goddess: <b>“Yā Devī sarvabhūteśhu, Śhānti rūpeṇa saṃsthitā.”</b><br>
O Goddess who resides to all this creation, created, all that is created, as peace. 
So you have to seek peace that is your Mother.<br> 
We all say that mantra. ... Is a prayer."</font><br>
