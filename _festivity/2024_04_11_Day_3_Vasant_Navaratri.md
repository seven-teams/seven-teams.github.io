<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we have decided to have a Pūjā of Śhakti that is the Power, that is the Devī.</b> You know within us there are many Powers of Mahākālī, Mahāsaraswatī, Mahālakṣhmī, Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
All these Powers are there for us to ascent. If these Powers are properly used and understood, then your ascent can be permanent. Once you achieve your ascent and enter into the Kingdom of God, all these Powers get enlightened.<br>
And these Powers which are enlightened are absolutely filled with Love. Enlightenment, we have to understand that we get completely enlightened by Love. So after enlightenment, after Realization we use only one Power which is of Love."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we'll worship the Śhakti</b> -- very much needed -- the Śhakti who destroyed all the devils, all the rākṣhasas. That is what you are going to worship today -- the Śhakti within you and without.<br>
<b>It's your desire which is going to work.</b><br>
So today we are going to worship the Śhakti Itself -- Mahākālī.<br>
May God bless you."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we have gathered here to do the Pūjā of the Śhakti.</b><br>
  Till today many Saints have written and spoken a lot about the Śhakti. Those who could not explain the Śhakti in their texts they did it in their poems. Additionally they learnt different meanings of the Śhakti.<br>
  But one thing probably we may not know is that inside every human beings these powers are present in a dormant state and all these powers human being can awaken within himself. All these powers which are present in the dormant state are endless, nor anybody can guess their limit because as an example there are 35 crores [350 million] Deities seated within you. Apart from that there are several powers that are running them, but at least we can understand that the Self-realization that we received today, certainly <b>some Śhaktis must have worked this out. Without this work you cannot get your Self-realization. When we are receiving our Self-realization we think that we got it very easily</b>."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>This Kuṇḍalinī Śhakti is your pure desire. It is the Desire of God Almighty.</b> When it is awakened in you, you get contented. You get satisfied and think that instead of material desire now I have entered into such a beautiful garden which is fragrant, full of joy, peace and love. When you achieve that state then you do not look back to material desires. To achieve this state in Sahaja Yoga is extremely beautiful. It happens very easily, you have to do nothing for it, give no money, do no rituals, no prayers, nothing. You should only have the pure desire to know the Spirit."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>They have one festival called Gangaur: that is a thing where they uh uh worship Gaurī.</b> That's the biggest festival where the Queen ... Mahārāṇī has to worship the Gangaurī: is a statue, which goes round the whole of Jaipur state and everybody celebrates it. Is regarded as the biggest festival. So she, in the morning she came and touched My Feet. And she said, "Mother, can I'p worship You?" I said, "Why?" "Because You are my Gangaur, really. That's just a statue." She made Me stand the same way, she did everything, she made Me eat betel. Uh I don't eat all that, but he, she said, "You have to, You are Gangaur, so You have to eat it." [Smiles, laughter.] And she worshiped Me and all her whole rituals she did for about f... forty-five minutes, and the ... then she said, "Now I'll go and worship that statue." "</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>We are the worshipers of Śhakti.</b> Here we are Śhakti Dharmī [religiously devoted to Śhakti] and many kings have been worshiping Ādi Śhakti.<br>
Everyone has different Deities and the names of each Deity is different. <b>The name of the Deity of this place is also different, it is Gangaur.</b><br>
But Ādi Śhakti was once born in Rajasthan state whose name was Satī Devī. It is Her Grace that we find our culture the dharma of wife, dharma of husband, dharma of ruling, etc. which are nourished by Her Śhakti.<br>
You all know the story of Satī Devī, I don't have to tell you in new way but She was Gangaur. She was married and while She was returning after marriage with Her husband some of the bad elements surrounded them and killed Her husband. She came out of the bride's carriage, took the Rudra Form and destroyed all of them who attacked Her husband and then She finished Herself also. We should see in this that since childhood till marriage She did not disclose that She was Mahāmāyā in any condition."</font><br>
