<font color="DarkGreen"><b>"I think we have had a nice time in this Holī, and we should always have such a nice time. Always with Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa’s blessings, you all should enjoy your Holī. But the greatest Holī is within yourself when you fill yourself with all kinds of colors.
Your nature should be such that everybody should enjoy that color. That color that is within you, color of beauty – not artificial, just showing off, just giving something without any love."</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Śhrī Rāma incarnated before Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. He was Maryādā Puruṣhottama and as such lived a very austere life. As a result of the austerities practiced by the King Himself, the whole society turned sober and serious. The element of joy and gaiety was completely missing. In Dwāpara Yuga, when Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa incarnated, He wanted to put an end to this extreme seriousness prevalent in the society. He thought of having a festival in which everyone could laugh heartily and have fun and joy. So the festival of color Holī, was started with this purpose."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"He started also this Holī, in which you should play with colors, maybe to get rid of the color barriers we have, maybe.
In America, it is a very good idea to play with colors and put some black on the Whites and some whites on the Black and they can see for themselves how stupid it is to fight in the name of color."</font><br>

<font color="MediumPurple">[SYNOPSIS!]<br>
[Inner awareness and a good attention is very important for burning your inner negativity. 
Only when it is burnt can you ascend on Nirmala Tattwa. Then you celebrate the real Holī, enjoy and play with color.
<b>Sahaja Yoga’s Holī should be the Holī of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.]</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Then the colors are, the colors are all representing your chakras.</b> These are all the chakras as you know. Every chakra has got different color. So what happens? These colors just get distributed in the air, in the atmosphere. During Holi time you [Unclear know you] are representing those colors which are completely permeating into the atmosphere. So this is another thing when you play colors. When you color another person, you are just expressing that these, your chakras will be blessed.</font> <font color="Red"><b>Red</b></font> <font color="DarkRed"><b>color is of the Mūlādhāra.</b> All those colors that you use here are of different chakras. So just you are making the whole expression of your love that let it be you become completely filled with red color, means innocence, means innocence. Because as a child in the womb of the mother just sees the red color of the mother, color of the blood.<br>
So like that you see different colors are spread on the face. And</font> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>abhira is the green color</b></font> <font color="DarkRed">of the Guru Tattwa. Like that all these colors have got significance that they are the colors of your chakras which you are spreading all over to your friends, to your other brothers and sisters who are Sahaja Yogis. So it has that symbolic expression that you are spreading your – actually the essence of your chakra, the basis of your chakra, the colors of your chakra, the fragrance of those chakras to other Sahaja Yogis.<br>
You just permeate, permeating. I don’t know in Hindi language if there is a better word like in Marathi ‘ud-har’, udahr. ‘Udhar’ means just ......<br>
... red color, is the sign of innocence. So Kabira says that, “You put me into such a color. Oh, the one who is going to color me is the One.” Rangaraj is the one who colors things. So He says, “Oh Rangaraj, make me so that the whole thing becomes red – innocence, fills me up with complete innocence.” And innocence is the one he has asked for to be filled in. And same is with Shrī Kṛiṣhṇa that He played with all these different colors to show that there are different charkas within us apart from the red and the others that are there. All of them play a part to create a beautiful joyful personality."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So, with Holī after dahan [scorching], like I said yesterday, <b>let us decide today, that now Holī will be like Diwālī. The joy of it should be overwhelming.</b> Why the joy of Holī? Although we burn just one Holikā but afterward, the joy flows in the Collective Consciousness, whether he is a sweeper or a garbage collector, or even any other person working in the house. Like in My family, in Lucknow, from where My family belongs, these people are landlords. So the sweeper does not dare to enter inside the house. People don’t like them coming even their threshold, to that extent. They reprimanded them.<br>
But on the Day of Holī, any person, whether he is a master or a servant, anybody, they all play Holī together. Even if you tear the clothes of the master then also no one will reprimand you on the Day of Holī. This is the way a social and collective celebration of happiness started in our country."</font><br>
