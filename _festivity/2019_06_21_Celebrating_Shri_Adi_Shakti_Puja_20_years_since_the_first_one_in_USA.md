<font color="DarkRed">"<b>I selected this place suddenly from a very thick newspaper, [laughing:] American newspaper.</b> The vibrations were just shooting out and I said, "What is this, coming from where?" And there was a little advertisement, and I said, "This is the place where we have to go. This place has so many vibrations, even in the advertisement."<br>
So you can imagine how the guidance comes. It comes from vibrations, and that's how I was here and thiss [this] place was selected by the Divine Force. It happened only in one day. Such a miraculous thing to happen in one day! It was taking so much time for them even to get this, and suddenly I told them, "Better get it." All worked out, and we are now here in the most beautiful atmosphere.<br>
Of course, you know that Red Indians were driven out, and they came here to hide themselves. They were hiding themselves in this place so that they should not be crushed and destroyed forever. That era is over now! That era of domination, of entering into somebody else's land and occupying it, and considering it to be a great bravery, all that is over now, the human understanding has gone much beyond, and they understand that, 'This is sinful, this is wrong. Whatever we have done was wrong.' But those people are no more. And the children and the grandchildren of those children, of these people who were the children of God, they used to think, do not like all that. Because you have no right: you take somebody's land like that and occupy it as your own."</font><br>

You will raise the vibrations to transform the people of this land.<br>
The native peoples of America worshipped Shri Adi Shakti as the Great Mother and they respected the land as sacred.<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Like, everywhere they went and uh oppressed so many people. In America, I was surprised to see that there were so many uh Red Indians, who are called as uh Indian Americans, [and] they were all oppressed. Oppressed so much that they had to run away to different places. And then I went to this place, Canajori [Canajoharie], I found the vibrations were so good. That means they were very innocent, simple people, and Americans that time, who went there, tried to completely finish them. So they went and hid in places like Canajori [Canajoharie]. But's the Canajori [Canajoharie] has such tremendous vibrations that I said, ``Look at this! So many years have passed, still the people who lived there or walked about and were absolutely enjoying this place were Red Indians," the ones who were Indians, we call them American Indians. <b>But they are so simple and innocent and they were so s..., I think, spiritual people because they used to worship the Mother, Mother, all the time they worshipped the Mother.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Then in America I bought a land. Hundred and forty [fourteen] acres of land. Americans are much more sensible I must tell you. They don't have this kind of a mental attitude that whatever is written [in a paper] is law, no. They will judge it."</font><br>

<font color="blue">Last weekend Sahaja Yogis listened as Śhrī Mātājī described exactly what is to be done in preparation for Śhrī Ādi Śhakti Pūjā on Her land.<br> 
She described how the stage is to be built, where the well is to be drilled, how the road is to be made and where the hanger is to be placed.<br>
Now that we know exactly what has to be done please come and help shape the road Śhrī Mātājī has named 'Sahaj Mārg'.<br>
Put paint on and decorate the walls of the building Śhrī Mātājī has called 'Nirmal Dham'.<br>
Help raise the water tower over the well on this land the Ādi Śhakti has called 'Nirmal Nagarī'.<br>
A few years ago we described Śhrī Mātājī's land as simply 114 acres of trees, two ponds, meadows and gently sloping hills</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"In your lives if people will see that you are very peaceful, good, helpful, collective people, then only, Sahaja Yoga will spread. Not what I am saying, or what I am spreading, or what I am working out. It's a fact that I always had a feeling that Sahaja Yogis should take to social work. I've been a social worker all My life, and I am a socialist in a way, but all these things I did, you may call it secretly, or anything, whatever it is, but some people knew about it, and this was to be done, and practically most of these cases are ready to be donated.<br> 
The reason I did not donate it in the beginning [is] because I wanted to see [that] there are people who are honest, and who will do the work honestly. Because in the name of social work, people just want to exploit. This is the reason I waited for so many days, and though I have given some of these already like Gaṇapatīpuḷe, or the hospital, also Dharmaśhālā school, all have been given. But now I want to give even more. Like I didn't know that, <b>in America, the land we have bought, in Canajoharie, is in My name; and I heard it I was surprised because there is no income from there, nothing of the kind, and I decided there and then, that it has to be given to the collective of Life Eternal Trust of America. It's all My desire that things should work out. But according to Sahaja Yoga, unless and until you have your Gaṇapati, Gaṇeśha, mother of land, motherland, where you start your work, it doesn't take form, it doesn't do anything.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="Maroon"><b>Thank You, O Shri Adi Shakti, for the seeking which brought us to Sahaja Yoga.<br>
You now lift up humanity into the omega of the Last Judgment.<br>
You have incarnated on this Earth for the Last Judgement.<br>
We pray that Shri Adi Shakti’s love continues to protect all the saints and seekers around the world.<br>
Shri Adi Shakti, Your work is greater than any.<br>
You created the pithas, the chakras, nature and humanity, and its subtle workings.<br>
May the complexity of Your work humble us down completely</b></font>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"The - another greatest thing that you get is love and compassion, love and compassion which acts, which works. For example now there are people who are taking drugs in this country. They can be easily cured. Easily. Overnight people have been cured from drugs, especially in England. And now they are leading a very normal life. They were all intelligent people, but lost in that troubles. <b>I have suggested that we could have this center for drug eradication in Canajoharie. But people are afraid of drug addicts. They say: The drug addicts we don't want to have among ourselves, because they trouble us. But it's an overnight, I told you, overnight you can get rid of your drugs.</b><br>
......<br>
<b>Luckily we have people here, even in such a far-fetched place like Canajoharie we have people who know about Sahaja Yoga.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="blue">Dear Brothers and Sisters,<br>
We would like to begin a three day celebration and worshiping of Shri Mataji in Her Real and Complete Form, the Shri Adi Shakti, the Source, the Cause, the Infinite, the Meaning, the Purpose, the Essence, the Path, the Destination, the Glory, the Everything, and the One who has created us, has enlighten us, has guided us, has nourished us, has empowered, has blessed us, and has enriched and fulfilled each and every aspect of our daily life.</font><br>
</p>

<p>
<font color="blue">This year, this celebration is a special one as today we are celebrating 20 years since the first Shri Adi Shakti Puja in USA, in the 114 acres land She has purchased 25 years ago in Fort Plain, Up-state New York. The heavenly names, Nirmal Nagarī, Nirmal Mārg, and Nirmal Dam, were chosen by Her. The minute details on how the stage is to be built, where the well is to be drilled, how the road is to be made, where the hangar is to be placed, are another blessing.</font><br>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>O Shri Adi Shakti, O Shri Mataji, we thank You again and again! Please allow us to worship You and never to sway away from Your Vision and Path. Please deliver us from all wrong doings and shortcomings so that we can establish Your Kingdom in the Holy Land of America.</b></font>
