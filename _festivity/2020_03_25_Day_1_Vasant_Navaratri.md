<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Chaitra is the month.</b> And this is the time when – [Marathi] – <b>Gaurī is the Chaitra</b>. So the establishment of the Gaurī is taken place during these nine days. But Gaṇeśha has to  be established before anything else. Though first Gaurī had to come, you can see that. Gaurī had to come first to establish Gaṇeśha. But Gaṇeśha is always put before even Gaurī. Before the Pūjana of the, worship of the Gaṇeśha, nothing starts; because He’s the one who takes out all the obstacles, all the negativities, all the hurdles that are going to come up, all the attentions that are here and there. So that’s why we first worship Gaṇeśha, just to ask Him to protect us."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"The other day I told you a little bit about <b>the first center, called as Mūlādhāra chakra and Kuṇḍalinī which is the residual consciousness in the triangular bone called as sacrum</b>. As I told you that this is the pure desire power which has not yet been awakened and is not yet manifested within you, which resides here waiting for a moment to arise and to give you your Second Birth, your Baptism it makes you at peace.<br>
It gives you your Self-realization.<br>
This pure desire is to be one with your Spirit. This, unless and until it is fulfilled those who are seeking will never be satisfied whatever, they may do. Now, this center is very important because this was the first center that was created when the Primordial Being started doing the job. This is the center of innocence that is holiness. First thing that was created was the holiness on this Earth. This center is very important in all human beings because animals have innocence, they have not lost it while we have ... or we can say we have a freedom to abandon it. We can do it, we can somehow or rather destroy it by our so-called ideas of freedom.<br>
Now, this center has a power to give us wisdom. Now wisdom is such, such a word that cannot explained. Wisdom is the balance between your understanding of what is good and what is bad"</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"Śhrī Gaṇeśha, please be kind and merciful and forgiving,<br> 
that You manifest within ourselves.<br> 
Let all these hypocritical things, 
all these conditionings,<br>
and all these wrong ideas we have,<br>
or all the wrong life we have had,<br>
just disappear like thin air;<br>
and let the beautiful moonlight of Your soothing qualities of innocence be manifested through us."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Kuṇḍalinī is the Gaurī and we have got Gaṇeśha sitting in the Mūlādhāra chakra. So we have Mūlādhāra as the abode of the Gaurī, of Kuṇḍalinī, and the protection of the Kuṇḍalinī is done by Śhrī Gaṇeśha. As you know, Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the Deity</b> which is for our innocence.<br>
Only Śhrī Gaṇeśha could be there in that position because as you know the pelvic plexus looks after all the excretory functions, and it is Śhrī Gaṇeśha only who can really stay there without getting dirty by the surroundings – He is so pure; He is so innocent – while the Kuṇḍalinī is the Virgin, the Virgin Mother of Śhrī Gaṇeśha. People have started talking against Mary by saying that there was something wrong, “How could a virgin get a child?” because we do not understand it is God and in the area of God anything is possible. They’re above all these things and they can create anything and in any way Gaṇeśha had to be born out of a virgin because He was so pure.<br>
So Kuṇḍalinī has to be supported by Śhrī Gaṇeśh. If Śhrī Gaṇeśha is weak, then Kuṇḍalinī cannot be supported. Śhrī Gaṇeśha has to support her in the awakening part first of all. When the Kuṇḍalinī is getting awakened, Śhrī Gaṇeśha stops all the functions that it has to perform."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"The first center is the Embodiment of Innocence is called as Mooladhara chakra<br> 
But Mooladhara itself is seated in the secram [sacrum] bone higher then Mooladhara chakra.<br> 
Mooladhara meaning the support of the root is the abode of the mother Kund[a]lini."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are going to worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha.</b><br>
Śhrī Gaṇeśha resides in Mūlādhāra, on the chakra, Mūlādhāra chakra. And not on Mūlādhār.<br>
In the Mūlādhār is placed the Kuṇḍalinī. She is the Mother of Śhrī Gaṇeśh, we call her Gaurī. Yesterday you saw the picture, the drama, how Śhrī Gaṇeśha got his head of an elephant. All these things have happened in another world. There are many worlds of which we know of this world, is a question of our awareness. Now we are at a human awareness, and we have risen to a higher awareness which is called as the fourth dimension. Without Śhrī Gaṇeśha it is not possible. As you know he is the symbol of innocence within us. This innocence never gets destroyed because it is eternal. But it may happen that it will get covered with some clouds by our mistakes that we commit. But once you get your Realization, your innocence is re-established, it manifests. And you become innocent, your attention becomes innocent. It is impossible to follow your religion, either Christ or Muhammad Sāhib or Jews, if you do not have enlightenment. This is one thing they did not realize because they were of a very high-level people. They did not know what is the condition of human beings."</font><br>

...... So today is the day to mark absolutely the first day when She incarnated on this Earth.<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So this day is celebrated because it’s a new year day and also because the New Moon appears on this day. It’s ... is called Guḍhī Pāḍavā.</b> On this day they put up a small pitcher on a stick with a small flag. The pitcher represents the Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
Śhālivāhana Kings were worshipers of the Goddess and it is said that they used to present Shawl to the Goddess and they were also called as Sāt[a]vāhanas in the beginning because they recognized the seven chakras [Sāt[a]vāhana means seven chakras]. That’s why they were earlier called as Sāt[a]vāhana but later it changed to Śhālivāhana. But the symbol of Śhālivāhana used to be guḍhī means a flag and above that a pitcher having a particular shape, which represented the Kuṇḍalinī. They were worshipers of Kuṇḍalinī and recognized it.<br>
That is the reason that they have made this thing like that and all those, who accept it, put up a ‘guḍhī’ in their houses. They [Śhālivāhans] wanted to welcome Kuṇḍalinī on this day and Kuṇḍalinī [in the form of pitcher] was exhibited specially on that day."</font><br>
