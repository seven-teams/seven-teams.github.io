<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Today is a special day of Guru Nāṇaka's birthday.</b><br>
Uh we have celebrated one Guru Pūjā uh-uh-uh ... and the, as you know that Guru Nāṇak was also the Incarnation of the Primordial Master, the same Spirit came on this Earth. And the He's the One who tried to re-establish the work of Muhammad.<br>
......<br>
All the religions were established on this Earth to create the seekers. You are the seekers: you are the Men of God. Now, all of you have to become Prophets. And to become Prophets, today's Sahaja Yoga has taken the form of Mahā Yoga. All of you have to become Prophets.<br>
The Prophets have two special qualities, as all the Prophets had: first of all, they have to talk about spiritual education. All of Them did that: Muhammad Sāhab did it, Rāja Janaka did it, Nāṇaka did it, Moses did it, Abraham did it. All of Them prophesized and taught you how to lead yourself in the right path, by the right action, by leading a right life."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is the birthday of Śhrī Guru Nāṇaka. It is being celebrated throughout the world with so much of zeal that I have not seen in India.</b> For the first time it has been advertised in so many papers and by different means.<br>
Guru Nāṇaka always talked of Sahaja Yoga. "Everything else," He said, "is just showing off." About religion He said that, "Observing fasts, going on pilgrimage, etc., are just meant to show off. Now you have to discover the power that is within you and establish it." Guru Nāṇaka kept on repeating the same thing again and again.<br>
He never talked of rituals."</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed"><b>"See the brotherhood of all mankind as the highest order of yogis, conquer your own mind, and conquer the world."<br>
"In the calm of Sahaj’s cave, You can discover the True One, Sayeth Nanak, the True One loves the truthful."<br>"
--Guru Nanak</b></font>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkGreen">"You have to educate yourself spiritually. 

And Guru Nāṇaka prophesized, just like William Blake, that, "The Men of God are going to come during Kali Yuga, and there will be many Prophets who will be transforming Prophets, who will be transforming people into Prophet State," He had prophesized.<br>
They have all prophesized about you! Now you have to prophesize about those who are going to be Prophets.<br>
......<br>
When Nāṇaka came in, He saw that Hindus and Muslims were fighting. So He started His theme with Kabīra, saying that, "Rām and Raḥīm are both the same, and how can you differentiate between the two?" <b>All their theme was like this, of integration of these two main religions which existed in India.</b>"</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Then came, you know Nāṇaka who preached that there should be no enmity between Hindus and Muslims, He preached that, because He saw the Muslims behaving in such a manner, they were such fanatics and they had become so funny that He could not understand, 'How is it? These are the people whom I have made Muslims and what are they doing here?'<br>
Actually <b>Mussulman means the person who is realized and Pīr is a person whose Realization is established</b> so much so that He [Prophet Muhammad] said that, 'Those who have become Mussulman should be buried and not burnt,' because He thought they are all realized Souls, but Realization finished off with His son-in-law and His daughter, after that He had two sons [grandchildren] who were great Souls who are really the Reincarnation[s] of Lav and Kuśh."</font><br>
