<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is the day peoples, this is created by human beings and not by God, as Guru Pūrṇimā. Because as God has created days of</b></font> [<font color="orange">unclear</font> their advent], <font color="DarkRed"><b>human beings have created days of their surrendering. So this is the day when you have to give something to the Guru.</b></font> And Guru does not have to give anything to you. This is the time you have to say what you are going to give, what you are going to do for your Guru. Because so far the Guru has been giving. If you are in meditation supposing you say we’ll meditate because Guru Pūrṇimā is there. That’s not the way the Guru Pūrṇimā is to be celebrated, because if you meditate you are taking from Me. If you try to correct yourself you are taking from Me. If you are going to get cured you are taking from Me. So now what can you do for Me? Is the point you have to think about. What can you do? Now I have sent the same question to India, [unclear] I asked them to find out what can you do for Me. You will say: ‘Mother, what can we do? After all, what are we?’ That’s a way of evading the issue. <font color="DarkRed"><b>But if you really want to see, you can do a lot and that is what it is that you are My witness. You are My publicity.</b></font>"</font><br>

<b>The one without any phases (hence he is celebrated on a Pūrṇimā Day, a Full Moon)</b><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkGreen">Today is the day of Guru Pūrṇimā. It is a Full Moon Day, that’s why it’s called as Pūrṇimā. The guru has to be like a Full Moon, means completely grown, completely matured.<br>
...... Now we have to understand the importance of guru. Why should we have a guru when we have God? We’ve got Śhakti, then why should we have a guru? What is the need to have a guru? Guru means ‘the weight’, the weight. We get our weight from the magnetic forces of the gravity of the Mother Earth. So guru means gravity, gravity in a person. Why do we need a guru? Because to know God is easy, specially in Sahaja Yoga, to be one with Him. <b>As soon as you get your Self-realization in Sahaja Yoga, the modern Sahaja Yoga, immediately you become entitled to give Realizations to other. It was said that guru is the person who makes you meet the Divine. That’s not true, because any self-realized person in the Sahaja Yoga can raise the Kuṇḍalinī and can give Self-realization to others, immediately after they have touched the Sahasrāra or opened the Sahasrāra. But normally a realized Soul cannot do it. Any born realized Soul cannot do it on its own, it has to have authority of Me as I am today.</b><br>
That’s why it was said that guru is a person who makes you meet God; he raises the Kuṇḍalinī and makes you one with God. Because in those days when the gurus were self-realized when the gurus were realized, they had the authority and power of raising the Kuṇḍalinī only after they had reached a very great state of evolution – complete purification, complete detachment.</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today is a great day, for all of us, because we are celebrating the Guru Pūjā and remembering all the Great Gurus who came on Earth to teach the world about the Truth. So many of Them were here. And They tried Their level best to explain to humanity what is spirituality.<br>
But is such a disparity that people never understood that spirituality is the most important thing we need, that we have to be one with the Divine Power."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"As today’s day is great, because we are thinking of all the great Saints who came on this Earth and who tried to lead us. What they did, all of them tried to spread the Truth all over the world. They suffered a lot, they had problems, so many problems, but they worked very hard in every way to spread Sahaja Yoga and talk about God and Divinity.<br>
All that is what today you have to give Me, a promise, that whenever you get any other human being, you can tell them about Sahaja Yoga. Not that it’s important but it’s absolutely immediate need of the world. If you understand this point, that at this time, why are you in this world and what is the need of the world, you will immediately start feeling the responsibility. Whether you are a man or a woman is not important.<br>
<b>Go all out to preach, think, make people understand about Sahaja Yoga in every way that is possible, and I think, then, you will become complete as gurus. If Sahaja Yoga is just with you, you cannot be a guru. ‘Guru’ also doesn’t mean that you go on preaching about Sahaja Yoga, talking about Sahaja Yoga, giving lectures about Sahaja Yoga, no! It means the one who gives Realizations to others.</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Sahaja Yoga is very different from all other gurus that we believe in the Power of Love. Power of Love teaches you how to be forgiving, it makes you noble, it makes you very balanced.<br>
<b>So, the gurus who were there for Bhavasāgara, to establish dharma in the human beings, first thing, they had to balance themselves against all practical things, as they call it.</b> They think is not practical!<br>
But they said, “No! For us, this is higher, nobler, and important.” <b>So they would balance people because they had this Power of Love within themselves. All these Ādi Gurus and Their Incarnations, if you see Them, They always had balance and always prayed ... praised the Love of God.</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Is a very important day, because as a Guru Pūjā, they say that a guru cannot give anything to you. But I can give you the advice, and the advice that you enlarge your heart, you become humble, and try to spread Sahaja Yoga with humility, not with aggressiveness. That is extremely important. If you can do that, then you’ll do full justice to this life, which is a spiritual life. Without that you cannot achieve, you cannot achieve, the strength of spirituality.<br>
For that you have to understand that it’s very, very important that you should give Sahaja Yoga a full chance, through your wisdom."</font><br>
