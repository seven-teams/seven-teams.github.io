<font color="DarkRed">"There is God and also we know that He is reflected in us, in our heart as Spirit, as Ātmā, as Self.<br>
Now, when we know about the three channels that are working within us, of Mahākālī, Mahālakṣhmī and Mahāsaraswatī, the Three Powers of Iḍā, Piṅgalā and Suṣhumṇā, which create the subconscious, preconscious and the conscious mind, are working in our consciousness. That means we are conscious of them. ......<br>
The Spirit, that is God, which is reflected in us, resides in the heart. The manifestation of Spirit in our heart controls the parasympathetic. But this Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty in our heart, as if in a mirror. And <b>Divine Love, which is the Light of God, is reflected in us through the reflection of the Spirit as the Unconscious Mind.<br>
...... So the Unconscious Mind is nothing else but the projection of God’s Will through the Light of Divine Love.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Only the Sahaja Yogis, those who are enlightened people, can worship Mahāsaraswatī.<br>
Otherwise, people can only worship Saraswatī because with worship of Saraswatī you can
read books, you can create dances, music, for the amusement of human beings, 
but actually the Saraswatī Pūjā is meant for people of ordinary awareness, means ordinary or normal human awareness.<br>
<b>But for Sahaja Yogis, it is the Mahāsaraswatī which is to be worshiped.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Hiraṇyagarbha (Prajāpati) is the creator aspect of God Almighty. It acts in the stomach of the Primordial Being which is a Void, also referred to as the Ocean of Illusion (Bhavasāgara). (The way this Void was created is covered later.) Hiraṇyagarbha’s Power incarnates as Mahāsaraswatī, and the entire material creation is the product of Her power and activity: She created all the galaxies, stars and planets including our own Sun, Moon and Earth. She also functions as the thinking power of the Primordial Being, and this process generates the Cosmic Ego (Ādi Ahaṅkāra). The channel carrying this power is the Ādi Piṅgalā Nāḍī, and it expresses the Primordial Preconscious Mind (Ādi Chitta). It acts like a postman who carries messages to the intellect of the Almighty."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we have the idea to do Saraswatī’s Pūjā.</b> [unclear] I have seen that here people worship Mahākālī and Saraswatī, people worship Devī and people are simple natured. We should worship Saraswatī as well.<br>
Saraswatī’s work is very great. First, Mahāsaraswatī created the entire universe. The earth element is special in this. The earth element has been placed in such a way between the Sun and the Moon that any living work can easily happen on it. From this living work, slowly and gradually human beings have been generated.<br>
But we should know our own great power. That power is what we call creation power, it’s also called creativity. This creation power is the blessing of Saraswatī by which many arts have been generated. The evolution of art is due to the blessings of Saraswatī."</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Because Saraswatī had a vīṇā in Her hand.</b> And that vīṇā is the Primordial Instrument which She plays, like music. And the music penetrates into the heart.<br>
You don’t know how it goes into you and how it works out. And that’s how a person who is a Sahaja Yogi should permeate, like music, into everything.<br>
She has so many qualities as I told you which cannot be described in one lecture. But <b>one of the greatest quality of Hers is: that She ends up into subtler things</b>.<br>
Like the Mother Earth will end up into fragrance.<br> 
Music will end up into melodies. Like that, whatever She creates ends up into something greater.<br>
Matter, whatever She’s produces in ... ends up into esthetics."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Śhāradā, the Goddess of Saraswatī is the one who carries the message of Virāṭa within and tells us how to sing.</b> She tells us what is appealing to God.<br>
How these rāgas were made also? Just think of it. Because first they chose the notes, the āroha [crescendo] and avarohas [decrescendos], the going up and down [ascending melody and descending melody], which was appealing to God. So the melodies were created.<br>
Melodies are fixed. You cannot change the melodies, the notes because they found out that, at this point, the Spirit awakened; on the vibrations they found out. They found out that, when they sang this way it worked out. The vīṇā [Primordial Instrument of Śhrī Saraswatī] they played and they found out the exact swaras. Exact swaras which would really make you feel nice.<br>
Now, you know that, those people have come from the West, don't understand any Indian music on the mental level but they understand at the spiritual level because their Spirits get filled with joy and the vibrations starts flowing."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now Saraswatī is the Goddess of learning and Mahāsaraswatī is the Goddess of knowledge, which is Pure Knowledge.</b><br>
Now the Goddess of learning, Saraswatī, has got four arms. She wears white, white cloths because is a sign of purity. She’s a virgin. Then She has in Her hand the vīṇā, that is the instrument which was the first instrument that was created by the Gods to play the classical music, or you can say the music that was appreciated by the Gods. So that’s one is vīṇā, and two other hands are: one has got a rosary in the hand, in the sense a person who is learned should be a person who should be very much detached.<br>
A saintly person should not have too many attachments and should not be – it always happens a person who is a learned man, who is overeducated, who is not so much interested in the family, he becomes more esthetic, is very discipline, self-discipline. He’s very meticulous, is very efficient, is very right-sided, as you can call it you see, so all that goes hand in hand."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"And then is in the left hand She has a book, so She – that means that the Power of Saraswatī gives you the full creativity by which you can create books. That also means that, but must have in the books means that whatever you’re doing now – supposing you’re doing Sahaja Yoga, Sahaja Yoga is say concerning the Divine. So we must know what are in the books, means in the Scriptures.<br>
..So one must learn how to respect the books, specially the Scriptures. And She’s the One Who gives you the penetration power into these books, to know what is the truth and what is not – penetration power to understand what is written between the lines, what is the subtle meaning of the whole thing – that is the Power of Saraswatī."</font><br>
