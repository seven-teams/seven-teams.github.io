<font size="+0">Dear brothers and sisters,<br>
Jai Śhrī Mātājī<br>
Today is Śhārad Pūrṇimā or Kojāgirī Pūrṇimā. This is a harvest festival celebrated on the Full Moon day of the Hindu lunar month of Aśhvin (September–October). It marks the end of monsoon. There is a traditional celebration of the moon.</font>

<font size="+0"><i>"In 82, 83 or 84 we celebrated Kojāgirī Pūrṇimā with Śhrī Mātājī at Hall in Saneguruji Vidyalay, Dadar, Mumbai where weekly Saturday meeting took place. She prepared milk also for all of us.
She mentions in that talk "Goddess comes to every body's house late at night on that day She ask "Ko jāgarti" in Sanskrit mean who has not awakened yet."</i><br>

<font size="+0"><b>The Significance of this festivity:</b><br>
On this auspicious day of Śhārad Pūrṇimā or Kojāgirī, moonlights are filled with Amṛut which clears negativities and all the diseases.<br>
On this day it is believed that Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī comes on the Earth and goes about from place to place asking, "Who is awake?" ("Ko jāgarti") and She showers Her blessings on those She finds awake.<br> 
Hence, the night is spent in festivity, singing and praising in honor of the Goddess. So people sit in the moonlight singing bhajans in praise of the Devī. Thus this Kojāgirī night in India is celebrated customarily by observing a night vigil and other rituals.<br>
All the Sahaja Yogis on this night collectively sings bhajans/praises to Śhrī Mātājī enlightening our powers within.<br>
Tonight is a very auspicious Full Moon when we can absorb the cooling rays of the Moon to cool down our right side and absorb the blessings.<br>
On this day we could thank Śhrī Mātājī for giving our Self-realization and sing a few bhajans to celebrate this occasion.</font>
