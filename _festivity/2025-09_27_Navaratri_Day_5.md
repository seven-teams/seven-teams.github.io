<font color="DarkRed">"You come up now to the Heart chakra. 

Heart chakra is divided into three parts. In the center of the Heart chakra resides Jagadambā Herself. But [in] the left side as I have told you resides Śhiva and His Power is Pārvatī. <b>When Pārvatī Herself separates Her identity with Her Lord and enters in the center to save Her children from the domination of the evil spirits, then She resides in the center and She is the Jagadambā. This is called as "Sacred Heart" in the Bible. She resides as Jagadambā. She has taken many Incarnations to save.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"For that, <b>we decided to have this Pūjā of Durgā today that all negativity should be destroyed</b>.<br> 
So many Deities build up the body of Kālī. Every part of Her body was created by a Deity, looked after by a Deity, and is also, later on, is reflected in you all. So they say that God has made human beings in His own image, I would say, I've made you in My own image, all the Deities at your disposal. They're all with you, and they have created you -- if you see it minutely -- it is the Deities who have brought forth all the beauty that you had. They have made all this beautiful congregation, beautiful transformation, and they have created such angelic people out of you. They are always working it out, but one thing you have to do is to have the drive.<br>
You had pure desire to ascend, but for what? You want to have the light, but for what? You want to become gurus, for what? To save people, for their salvation.<br>
Only through your channels I can work out Sahaja Yoga. If I could work out Myself, I would have.<br>
It's not question of killing one rākṣhasa. God knows how many there are, rākṣhasas and rākṣhasas. And they are everywhere, even within you they were. Now they've gone out."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"This is a worship of the Śhakti. Until now many Saints, Sages have known and revealed about this Śhakti. Whatever they could not describe in prose, they tried to convey by poetry. <b>Whatever description was not possible to put in words -- they composed different names of the Devī and described. We know all this and many people also know the meaning of this. But one thing they perhaps do not know is that every human being has all these śhaktis, powers dormant in them and they can awaken them.</b> These dormant powers are eternal and limitless.<br>
Besides the thirty-three crores of Devas, there are many Śhaktis. But we can say that this Self-realization that we have achieved today, has been achieved through working of some Śhakti or the other. Without this you could not have achieved the Self-realization."</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"Saint Eknāth comes from Pratiṣhṭhān. Pratiṣhṭhān comes from Paiṭhaṇ.<br>
And he is the one, who has written this 'Jogawa', means the Yoga and at that time he sang this in a very village language and it is sung by so many people all over the Maharashtra. You can imagine that this song was written so many years back and now they have converted into kind of a -- for a Sahaja Yoga -- but it is a very -- absolutely precisely described -- what they wanted at that time. Now, in the beginning he says -- the Goddess of Maharashtra was called as 'Bāyā'. You will be amazed -- in My childhood my name was Bāyā. They use to call Me in My family as Bāyā. So, he is saying that "I will ask Mother to give me the Yoga." In the villages it is said "Jogawa" -- again he says -- "Bayecha Jogawa," means "of Jogawa from the, Goddess Baya." "I will be asking the Jogawa."<br>
Now 'Anādi Nirguṇi' the One which is primordial -- 'Ādi' beyond primordial -- the One which is without any guṇas has manifested this 'Bhawāni' on this Earth, and She's come ... She's come to kill this Mahiṣhāsura. Also She has come 'Trividh tāpānchi karavāyā jhāḍānī' to remove our three types of heating pains and now She is going to come for our 'Nirvāṇa', that time he had said, he says that "what will I do when she will come for my 'Nirvāṇa-Dwaitya' I have got," means 'I am thinking about myself as separate from God.' 'Dwaita' is that you think this world is separate from God. When we think that this is 'advaita', that we are in one with God, then I will remove this 'dwaita' and I will put a garland to Her and in my hand I will take the flag of enlightened knowledge -- already he is describing it -- and without any discrimination about caste or religion or anything I will go to visit Her. Then what I will do, for nine days I will do nine types of bhakti of this Goddess and then I will give up all other asking or anything and I will ask for a son who is knowledge.
Then what will I do -- this is a lady singing, he sings like a lady -- so he says that this world is full of ego, 'dambha' is false pride, so I will give up that kind of bad son. It is the bad son and what will I do in the 'paraḍī' [trug] is the place in which you carry flowers for the God. In that 'paraḍī' [trug] I will put complete enlightened knowledge and all the 'aśhā manuṣhyān̄chyā' [such and such of men], means all the desires and all the aspirations I will finish them [Marathi] I'm sorry [Marathi]. Separate %... manīṣhā ākāṅkṣhā manuṣhyāhcyā, manīṣhāncha<br>
[After a Sahaja Yogi says first, "Break, break, and then "Break them":] Hain, completely break them. "Manovikāra Vikāra Kareen Kurvanti" all my 'Manovikāras', you see all the mind, which is so much conditioned -- like they say in Hindi that you take out the bad eye. So I will take out as that from my Mother Earth. "Amṛit Rasachi bharīn bharīn Me dhurdi" basket I will be filling with the 'Amṛit Rasa' that is the Ambrosia.<br>
"Ātā Sāzāni," [she is telling her friend] "Oh, my friend, now I have become completely detached niḥsaṅg and my husband who was a doubt, I have given up living with that husband of mine," means the doubt has disappeared from me. Then she says that the 'kāma and krodha' these are two, 'māng' is the one, Scheduled Caste people who burn the bodies and I have given them up and what ever left I have made my I have opened out my tunnel that is of Suṣhumṇā -- see now.<br> 
Such a Yoga I have asked and kept it with me when I got it. I went to the great door and I thanked the God Almighty and I have now come out of this life and death problems.<br>
At that time he wrote all this and today you are getting the results. Just that, so clearly and a lady singing this, we have to take some vows, something about yourself and about others. We. Have to remember one great thing -- that we are Yogis now. That too we are Sahaja Yogis and as Sahaja Yogis, we have to be 'par excellence', in our behavior, in our temperament, in our dealing with others, tackling any situation or getting solution out of some problems."</font><br>
