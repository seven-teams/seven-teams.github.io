<font color="DarkRed">"Yesterday you saw, beautiful description of Navarātri and how the Mother Goddess has created all kinds of powers within you. It's not that only She has the powers, but you all have the powers, and you can all work it out, you can all find out whether these powers are there or not.<br>
With us, the Realization is very important, but there the Kuṇḍalinī has given you this Realization. Of course Kuṇḍalinī is a part or, we can say, reflection of Ādi Śhakti, and also <b>the Jagadambā is also part of Ādi Śhakti</b>.<br>
She's placed in the center of two hearts, which is a very important point. Now all these powers are placed in that chakra. So you imagine how many of these powers must be there, and Her Powers are expressed through the center Heart in all the gaṇas you have around your body. Now these gaṇas are the ones who do give you the protection, give you the sleep, give you the energy, give you the blessings. All of them are at work all the time, and these bodies are extremely dedicated and connected all the time to the <b>Mother Ambā, we can call Jagadambā. Now She is the Mother of the Universe, so you can imagine, how busy She has to be to look after the whole Universe!</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now, when we are celebrating the greatest of greatest this Navarātri, there must be something special about it, that we have to cleanse this heart completely,</b> fully and make it so pure that it purifies all the blood that passes through the whole of the body. So the cells of this heart, which has made this great organ, has to be the best, because the cells of the heart within a human body are the best cells, the highest quality, the most sensitive. And it's the heart that expresses the Anāhata, the sound that is without percussion. While we find that there are some people of caliber, there are, but others talk more, show off more, and do not have the caliber."</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"If there is the Father and the Son there has to be a Mother. Because of that, the whole time the motherhood has not been respected. <b>But Mother is the power behind every creation.</b><br>
Now, this Kuṇḍalinī is the reflection of Athena, of Ādi Śhakti, of the Holy Ghost. She is your individual, your own mother and She is the one who is anxious to give you your Second Birth. She has been with you for so many years, for so many past years and She knows everything about you and also She loves you, loves very much and She cares for your benevolence.<br>
So like this instrument has to be connected to the mains, you are also to be connected to the mains. As ... as this instrument has no meaning without this connection, we have no meaning without our connection to the Divine Power. <b>So it is a myth if you go on taking the name of God and calling Him and nothing works out because you are not connected.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"...... <b>Mahāsaraswatī created the entire universe</b>. The earth element is special in this. The earth element has been placed in such a way between the Sun and the Moon that any living work can easily happen on it. From this living work, slowly and gradually human beings have been generated.<br>
But we should know our own great power. <b>That power is what we call creation power, it's also called creativity.</b><br>
This creation power is the blessing of Saraswatī by which many arts have been generated. The evolution of art is due to the blessings of Saraswatī. [{\bf Variant:} This power is the blessing of Śhrī Saraswatī due to which all the various art forms originated. The outback of art is due to the blessings of Śhrī Saraswatī."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Now the Durgā's qualities are that She is protective of Her children, She's very gentle, very soft with Her children, and She's extremely horrifying to the satanic people, to the negative people. So in this rāga I think because there are, the notes are spaced out. So either you could play it slow or you could play it fast. Nothing in between. That's why it is on a Durgā's style. You see, either <b>She is extremely gentle or She is extremely horrifying. So because She has a double function: is one to look after Her children, and another is protect Her children from the devils</b>. So She has to be very quick about it, to fight them, and to, in every <b>way to frighten</b> them and to be alert about it.
So in the second part you all became very <b>alerted I saw</b>. In the first part you were having a lullaby because it was the Mother's Love that was playing. The second part you became alert, because She has to fight. Now, this is such a nice rāga because it gives you a better sense of security within yourself, <b>builds up sense of security</b>, and also as you know medically that it's important to build up this chakra because that gives you <b>antibodies created</b>. So to fight all the diseases, to fight all the foreign things which try to attack us.
So this rāga is so apt, absolutely apt for today's atmosphere and for today's <b>need</b>. That we have to have the security of the Mother and the protection of the Mother and that all the evil forces must be finished from this world, and that's how this rāga has a very great significance ......"</font><br>
