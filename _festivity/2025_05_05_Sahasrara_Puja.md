<font color="DarkRed">"I have to tell ... I'll have to tell you the story about the Sahasrāra Day, about which it was decided, long time back, before I incarnated. They had a big meeting in the Heavens, all the thirty-five karoṛs [350 millions] of Gods, the Deities, were there present to decide what is to be done. <b>`This is the ultimate that we have to do to human beings: is to open their Sahasrāra, to open their awareness to the Spirit, to the Real Knowledge of the Divine, to remove the darkness of ignorance.' And it had to be spontaneously because it has to work the living force of God.</b> Also it had to be very quick. So all the Gods requested that now, I, the Ādi Śhakti, has to take the birth.<br>
They all tried Their best. They did whatever was possible. The Saints were made by Them but very few. They incarnated and people made religions out of Them which were perverted, brought Them bad name."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"It has been such a great pleasure and glorification of Sahaja Yoga today, I remember the day when it started, on the 5th May 1970. And today I see all of you so much engulfed in the Divine Love and Divine Power.<br>
<b>The whole thing shows one very great, fundamental thing, of Sahasrāra: that people from so many countries integrated together.</b><br>
Integrated. It was sahaj, spontaneous, but every way and there was no confusion, there's no quarreling, no fighting, nothing. Such an integration, spontaneous, whether it is on the stage or stage of life.<br>
Now, as we are all global personalities, we are all integrated and those who were acting were enjoying as well as the ones who were looking at them were also enjoying in the same manner.<br>
It was such a good also integration between the one who was acting, or the all those who were there, and all those who were watching -- I couldn't understand whether the people who are seeing them are also acting, or also those who are acting are also seeing.<br>
It was a beautiful blending I must say, and I congratulate all the leaders of all these five countries, who have contributed so well to this deep sense of integration.<br>
Not that is the integration within that is important -- of course that's very important for a personality, but for our work, for our global emancipation we need integration of all the nations, and understanding of all the nations, because these barriers are created by human beings, not by God Almighty.<br>
So we have transcended those barriers, and the way we are all sitting together in a complete integrated mood is -- you don't know what your Mother feels, I, I just can't believe that in such a short time this we have achieved, in My lifetime I can see all these things happening.<br>
So it was such a beautiful sahaja, spontaneous, creation of the Spirit of this integration, and I congratulate all the leaders for this, and we all should thank them, for giving us this beautiful integrated, sahaj spontaneous illustration of [the] sahaj character.<br>
Thank you very much.<br>
May God bless you all."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"<b>So first I had to open out My Sahasrāra itself. Then your Sahasrāras could be opened out</b>, that's why.<br>
And then I felt that: a tremendous flow of My Grace started flowing. So much Grace even upon Me, My own face, like torrential rain, you see, on Me. Absolutely I was so drenched in that joy, really I was lost, absolutely lost. Sort of I felt that the whole creation is now resounded with that Universal Consciousness, just like that. Everything was finished, only the joy was permeating. It was such a beautiful time.<br>
And then I started My work."</b></font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>We can say, in 1970, fifth May, [for the] first time, the Collective Spirit of God opened out.</b><br>
So far, the blessings of God came to human beings individually as Grace and they received their Self-realization individually, one by one. And the method for individual Realization was just the opposite of the collective. First, they had to establish their dharma, cleanse themselves fully, desiring all the time for their salvation, putting their attention to their salvation, as you call it Īśhwarapraṇidhān [desire for God], thinking of God, asking for His Grace and acting in a scrupulous, dhārmik ways to keep themselves pure. They had to control their mind, control their desires, control their action in such a manner that they absolutely kept to the center path. And when they could get through all that testing and immunity, I mean they deserved, then only the Grace of Mother gave them Realization. "</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Sahasrāra is your awareness. When it is enlightened you get into the technique of the Divine.</b><br>
Now there are two techniques: the technique of the Divine, and the technique that you follow. You cannot act as Divine, but you can use the Divine Power and maneuver it.<br>
For example, Divine looks after all the universal happenings. Every minutest particle is controlled by Divine.<br>
When your Sahasrāra opens out and your Kuṇḍalinī touches the fontanel bone, sort of a igniting force is ready in your Sahasrāra, and as soon as the fontanel bone area opens up through the Brahmarandhra, the Grace of your Spirit ignites that igniting force and your nāḍīs get enlightened. Not all of them, quite a lot of them; not all the length, but quite the peripheries. That's how you get your enlightenment."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"When the seventh chakra was opened, all the chakras came to your Sahasrāra, and so I could manage all your chakras and all your Deities. Any Deity you ask and you get the vibrations.<br>
<b>So that proves that I am the Brahmachaitanya.<br>
The Brahmachaitanya is the Ādi Śhakti and Sadāśhiva is also in My heart.</b><br>
But since I am so much humanized, it is not so easy to find it out. If you tell this to modern human beings, they will not understand. It can only be told to Sahaja Yogis because they will understand. To bear this Truth is so difficult."</font><br>
