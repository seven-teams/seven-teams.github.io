<font color="DarkRed">"What to say about Hanumāna? <b>The more powerful and wise, he was equally devoted and dedicated.</b> Generally, such a powerful person becomes right-sided and considers himself so high that he would not listen to anyone else. But <b>Hanumāna is a special Deity, a typical Deity full of qualities. There was a perfect balance between his devotion and power.</b> How could he achieve this balance is a thing to be understood.<br>
In Sahaja Yoga, when we are enlightened, we get many powers. Then we have to keep balance. We love others and with the power of the love, we keep on doing our duties.<br>
Śhrī Hanumāna was very powerful. He had many Divine Powers in Him Navadhā, that is Garima, Laghima, etc. He could be as big as he wanted to be and as small as an atom. He had achieved all these powers. Without attaining balance and coming to the central path. Such a powerful person generally goes crazy.<br>
<b>Each cell of Śhrī Hanumāna’s body was filled with power and devotion.</b> Because of this specialty today we worship Śhrī Hanumāna all over the world."</font><br>

<font color="blue">"<b>Today we have come here to do Hanumāna’s Pūjā.</b><br>
Śhrī Hanumāna is a great character in our being and He runs all the way from Swādhiṣhṭhāna to your brain 
and He supplies all the necessary guidance we need in our futuristic planning or in our mental activities. <b>He gives us guidance and protection.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="chocolate"><b>You control people who have too much right side.
You bring down the speed of right-sided people (by giving them lethargic heaviness).
You hold a mace (the gada) in Your hand to reduce our illusions.
You are the source of enthusiasm.
Through Your bhakti (ocean of love) we may use Your fire. 
In this way, we may act without heating up our right side.</b></font><br>

<p>
<font color="blue">"<b>"What we have to learn from Śhrī Hanumāna is this devotion (bhakti) and the power that he has given to you. If your devotion is real, then no one dares touch you. No one could touch.</b><br>
There are thousands of examples in Sahaja Yoga. People call them miracles. But I say that it is no miracle, it is the blessing of Śhrī Hanumāna.<br> 
<b>So My blessings and Love to you all. Love yourself, also love others.</b><br> 
Do not confine your love to “my son, my this, my that.” No! Love means selfless love (Nirvāja Pyār) love that expects no return, love that is not confined to relations only. You have been blessed with such unfathomable Power of Love. Use it.<br>
Infinite blessings.</font><br>

<font color="blue">"It is such a joy today, and the whole atmosphere seems to be bubbling with it as if the angels are singing.<br>
And <b>the specialty of Hanumāna was that He was an angel.</b> Angels are born like angels. They are angels, and they are not human beings.<br> 
They’re born with the angelic qualities. But now, you all have become angels from the human beings. It’s a very great achievement of Sahaja Yoga.<br> 
The qualities that are born with the angels are seen from their very childhood."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Hanumāna’s whole life was spent in serving Śhrī Rām. And He was such a dedicated bhakta of Śhrī Rām.</b><br>
Now here the contrast is also that Hanumāna had Navadhā, Navadhā uh-uh Siddhis, Navadhā Siddhis, Nine Siddhis: the Aṇima, Garima, Raguma [Laghima], and all sorts of things, that He could become small, He could become big, He could ... it so many things He had. Despite all these siddhis and the amount the [of] power He had, that Śhrī Rāma once asked Him that, “My s... My ah-ah-ah brother now, uh Lakṣhmaṇa, is being hit and He’s very sick. I mean, He’s just dying, so you go and get a particular kind of a sañjīvanī, a kind of a[n] herb, is which I want to rub on His head.” So He went there and He found He couldn’t find it so He brought the whole of the mountain on His hand and [laughing:] gave it to Rāma, “Now You select! I don’t know, I can’t find it.” [Soft laughter.]<br>
<b>That is the Hanumāna Śhakti! And with all that power, He was such a humble person and such a dedicated person.</b><br>
<b>This is the sign of a powerful Sahaja Yogi. Anybody who is powerful has to be humble and nonviolent.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>Bhima rupi Maha-rudra</b></font><br>
You are huge in form; the greatest and most formidable;
the final manifestation of Śhrī Śhiva's eleven destroying powers.<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Vajra Hanumāna Māruti</b></font><br>
You are known as the invincible one after being struck on the chin (hanu) by the thunderbolt of Indra. You are he who was born of the lord of the wind (Marut).<br>

You destroy the outward forms of illusion such as the beautiful gardens and forests of Lanka. You are the son of Añjanī.<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Rāmduta Prabhanjana</b></font><br>
You are the messenger and divine energy of Śhrī Rāma. You are like the stormy hurricane wind, and to Your Mother, the radiant dawn light that dissolves the individual soul into Paramchaitanya.<br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"I hope by today’s Pūjā, that enthusiasm, that venturesome nature will vibrate your Piṅgalā, and without feeling any ego about it, in the most humble manner as Hanumāna was, you will do the jobs.<br>
Obedience is the only thing that helps to carry out your work and you’ll become humbler and humbler.<br>
But if you think, ‘Oh I am doing this,’ then finished. <b>But if you know that it’s done by the Divine – ‘Paramachaitanya is doing everything, I am just an instrument,’ the humility will be there and you will be an effective instrument.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Now, <b>He’s the one who protects also all the deities, He protects.</b> Now, there’s a difference between Shri Ganesha and Him. The Shri Ganesha gives energy Shakti, but the one who protects is Shri Hanumana. So you’ll find that when Shri Krishna was the chariot[eer] of Arjuna then on top of the chariot was sitting Hanumana, not Shri Ganesh. Hanumana was sitting there looking after Him. Also in a way that Shri Rama Himself becomes Shri Vishnu, so He has to look after Him."</font><br>
