<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Nine are the days, in the night, when the Goddess had to fight the demons and to save Her children from the effects of negativity.</b><br>
On one side She was Ocean of Love and Compassion, and on the other side She was protecting them like a tigress; because the times were such that nobody could meditate, nobody could take the name of God, nobody could think even of Self-realization. But those who are sitting here today, you have been there also in those days, and you were all saved for today, for this day, so that you can achieve your Self-realization.<br>
The form of the Goddess in those days was not Māyā Swarūpi[n]. She was in Her real form and that created a great awe, even among the disciples. So the question of giving them Self-realization was not there. First of all they were to be saved."</font><br>

<font color="Red"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> <font color="DarkRed"><b> I say that before going out please take a bandhan.</b> It's a kavach, we call it a kavach. Means, kavach, in English there's a word for that?</font><br>
<b>Sahaaj Yogis [suggest]:</b> Protection.<br>
<font color="Red"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> <font color="DarkRed">That's rather, protection is abstract, but this is a protection of the Mother is a concrete stuff, you see, kavach. So you take the kavach. Kavach is something you can say that people wear those armor, inside, you see that sort of a thing, is kavach. So you must take that before going out or talking to somebody. That you don't do.<br>
......<br>
It's just a simple thing, take your kavach when you are going out. It's so simple, I mean, in Sahaja Yoga we don't have to do horrible rituals that people do, nothing of the kind. Just take your bandhan in the morning when you are going out and if somebody is argumentative just give a bandhan. Anything, <b>little bandhan can work out so many things but we forget that we have entered into the Kingdom of God and all the Saints and all the angels and gaṇas are at your disposal</b>.</font><br>

<b>Padamékam na gachchhetu yadichchhéchchhu-bhamãtmanah.<br> 
Kavachénã-vruto nityam yatra-yatraiva gachchhati.<br>
Tatra tatrartha labhashcha Vijayah sarvakamikah,<br>
Yam yam chintayété kãmam tam tam prãpnoti nishchitam.<br>
Parmaishvaryam-tulam prãpasyaté bhutalé pumãna.</b><br>
 One should invariably cover oneself with this Kavacha (by reading) wherever one goes, and should not walk even a step without it if one desires auspiciousness.<br> 
Then one is successful everywhere, and all one’s desires are fulfilled and that person enjoys great prosperity on the earth.<br>
<b>Nirbhayo jāyate martyaḥ, saṅgrāmeṣhv’aparājitaḥ<br>
Trailokye tu bhavet-pūjyaḥ, kavachen'āvṛitaḥ pumān</b><br>
The person who covers himself with Kavach becomes fearless, and is never defeated<br>
In battle, And becomes worthy of being worshipped in the three worlds.<br>
<font size="+0"><b>(In short now it is a bandhan, it is the same thing as Kavacha)</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So as it is we are today praying to the Goddess that, `Help us to fight our negativity within us. <b>Give us Your tiger so that we fight, give us Your lion so we fight.</b>' Let us fight all these horrible animals that are within us, these horrible haunting things that are within us, these horrible conditionings we have. You have to get rid of it. Still, still if you watch yourself, lots of conditionings are there, lots of things, you see. If you see, there are covered with very thin curtains and you don't see it, but they are there. But let the tiger enter into all these dens and find out. And you enjoy that, riding over the horse, riding over the lion, and riding over the tiger -- like a Goddess. Why not? After all, children get all the heritage of the mother, don't they? So you have all the heritage available to you. <b>But you have to be worthy, in the sense that you have to know that you are worthy, that's all. You have to just know that you are worthy and that you can do it.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"I would say, with this, today's special celebration of Navarātri. Like yesterday you saw Śhrī Durgā's Nine Forms, also. In that, <b>one is Kuṣhmāṇḍā, is one of the forms, that you absorb all the filth in yourself, in your stomach.<br>
But the Devī does that, not you. What the Devī can do, you should not do, that's Her job</b>, that She is supposed to do this, not you.<br>
What you have to do is to only be in silence so that you absorb whatever will increase that silence, will increase your depth. The Devī will look after all the rest of the things, She'll look after all the filth, all the anger, all the temper, all the everything that's going on in this world. She will absorb all that, but what you have to do is to just enjoy everything that is pure.<br>
Enjoyment is only possible when you are beyond your mind. With your mind you can never enjoy, it is like a big load. It will not act, it will not help. Enjoyment comes when you are in complete silence, in a rippleless lake, the reflection of all the joy that is created on the shores of that lake are completely reflected, they are not deflected, if they were repulsed it would have been a different image altogether, and would have been something nowhere near the image of reality."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>These people have decided today to have a Pūjā, and you know what happens to Me when you do My Pūjā.</b> So with all those problems that will be facing later, I would like all of you to be attentive about the Pūjā and to take full advantage of that. <b>With this Pūjā you get the Mother's protection, to begin with.</b> And My chakras, when they start moving, they give you special powers of love and bless all your chakras and fill them up completely. So I would like you, though some two people are coming to do this, all of you to feel that you all are doing it, and you can feel it that way with oneness. And the blessings of My being will flow to you automatically."</font><br>
