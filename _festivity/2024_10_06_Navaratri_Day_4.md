<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we have gathered here to do the Navarātri Pūjā.</b><br>
There were nine times when the Major Incarnations of the Mother of this Universe were manisfested [manifested]. They were manifested with a purpose. That purpose is to protect Her bhaktas, Her disciples, Her children.<br>
This was a binding love. She could not escape it. Mother's Love is binding. She cannot escape it. And She has to manifest it, work it out, and give that protection to all Her children."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>In Sahaja Yoga, Navarātri is the most important Pūjā, I would say.</b> Though we can say in modern Sahaja Yoga Sahasrār Day is, because that's how you started getting your Realization.<br>
But if you go to the whole historical events of evolution you'll find [that] Navarātri is the one which has brought you to Sahasrāra. Without the help of the Devī at different stages of your ascent, you could not have been in a position to receive your Realization."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>You see God’s creation.</b> He has created you and He’s not the one who is going to destroy His own creation. You don’t do anything. You just don’t do anything.<br>
You see, this is the wrong impression human beings have got. What they do is a dead work. Now see, the flowers are dead so you have arranged them. The tree is dead so you have made the furniture, that is all.<br>
Dead to the dead. Any living work can you do? Any living work? Nothing. Only after Realization, you can do it, by awakening the Kuṇḍalinī. Then you can do it. Then you are entitled to become the master."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So we have made it short now, just take a bandhan, it is he same thing as kavacha you see. Realized Souls, if they take bandhan is the same thing. Whatever you have said here is done, yesterdays and todays, everything that has been said, all these rakṣhākari [act of protection] is done in one stroke.<br>
But now we should know how many of us take bandhan before going from the house, before sleeping or before doing something important. How many people take bandhan. Very seldom you forget it. Very important, going on a journey, going on a road, better take a bandhan, not that we are all right, Mother is looking after us, is not the point. You must take bandhan before doing all these things.<br>
If you get an accident, then know that you have done some mistakes, or something otherwise, normally there should be not an accident, means there is something still lacking in you."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"The Devī has many forms, but is the Embodiment of the Śhakti. Ādi Śhakti gives Śhakti to all these Embodiments.<br>
And so, there are many Goddesses we have. At different times, They came on this Earth, and did all that was necessary for the ascent of people who were seekers.<br>
Specially, the One we know of <b>Jagadambā, the Durgā, She was trying to protect all the Seekers of Truth and to destroy all evil forces</b>.<br>
Because without the ascent of human beings, they do not know the Truth. And that's why, whatever they try to do is a mental projection.<br>
And this mental projection, if it is not sumsti ... substantiated by Truth, by dharma, it declines. In Sanskrit they call it glāni.<br>
<b>When this glāni takes place, then Incarnations are born to solve the problem.</b><br>
In all Incarnation of the Goddess, there have been very much incarnated, the satanic forces, they had incarnated, and She had to fight them ... with them, and destroy them. But this destruction was not for the destruction's sake that, `The evil forces are to be destroyed,' but evil forces always try to put down the seekers, put down the Saints, try to hard ... harm them, sometimes even destroy [them].<br>
All these destructive forces do not come at the same time, normally. At different times: is easy to handle.<br>
But <b>the aim of the Incarnation is to save, to protect the people who are seekers, because they are the most important people in the realm of spirituality.</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"I would say, with this, today's special celebration of Navarātri. Like yesterday you saw Śhrī Durgā's Nine Forms, also. In that, one is <b>Kuṣhmāṇḍā, is one of the forms, that you absorb all the filth in yourself, in your stomach.<br>
But the Devī does that, not you. What the Devī can do, you should not do, that's Her job</b>, that She is supposed to do this, not you.<br>
What you have to do is to only be in silence so that you absorb whatever will increase that silence, will increase your depth. The Devī will look after all the rest of the things, She'll look after all the filth, all the anger, all the temper, all the everything that's going on in this world. She will absorb all that, but what you have to do is to just enjoy everything that is pure.<br>
Enjoyment is only possible when you are beyond your mind. With your mind you can never enjoy, it is like a big load. It will not act, it will not help. Enjoyment comes when you are in complete silence, in a rippleless lake, the reflection of all the joy that is created on the shores of that lake are completely reflected, they are not deflected, if they were repulsed it would have been a different image altogether, and would have been something nowhere near the image of reality."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So to recognize Me, what should we do? If we recognize, then you are protected.</b><br>
...... if you could recognize Me, to understand Me, that I am Divine Personality. It's an Incarnation. That's all the Deities want. Then they'll look after you in every way. They'll give you all the powers. They'll give you all the satisfaction, all the protection that you want."</font><br>
