<font color="DarkRed">"On this day of Diwālī, I want to tell you all that the meaning of Diwālī is that the Hell is full of darkness and you all are enlightened. You are expected to fight wherever there is darkness and let them know that they are wrong deeds. By doing this our country will improve and you have to do this. We have been performing Pūjās and rituals but the Śhakti [Divine Power] which is there within us, is there to oppose all that is not truthful. Many people do not know that making money is a sickness. They will go straight to Hell. I am telling you all this because no one has said it like this before. On the day of Diwālī, I am telling you that we are going to light lamps and celebrate happiness in our hearts."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"On the fourteenth day, he was killed by Ṣhaḍānana, Kārttikeya, was the Son of Pārvatī and Śhaṅkar who was a very powerful expression of Rudra Śhakti, is that He is the Killing Power of God. And He was created specially for this purpose to kill Narakāsura. Then the ... this one was, this rākṣhasa was such a menace and he had ruined so many people slight. He has done such a havoc and people didn’t know how to find protection.
That time, when Narakāsura was killed by the Śhakti in the form of Ṣhaḍānana, Kārttikeya, there was celebration all over. People celebrated the next night."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Then there is, the second day is where Narakāsura was killed. Now Narakāsura was the one who was the devil from the hell, let’s say – very cunning, very clever – and he was killed by the Goddess. Actually he was killed by a, another Incarnation, Kārttikeya, but Goddess gave Him the power to kill. So when he was killed it was celebrated because the evil was killed. But we don’t find that these days the evil people are getting peace awards. So what is the reason for this kind of a perverted brain? How is it they are using perversion? Just the opposite of it. What has worked out these things? So again we find the same so-called freedom to become also evil. So we have freedom to become evil. First of all, we have freedom not to be benevolent, and secondly to become evil we have freedom.<br>
So the Narakāsura within us must be killed, the one which teaches us evil, to do evil to others. If you are busy doing evil to others you can never enjoy. Because you enjoy doing evil to others. So that has to be faced within ourselves, not in other people."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"And the fourteenth day, one has to become a killer.<br>
Killer of all that is ignorance, of all that is stupid, idiotic, all that is cunning and all that is emotional. Kill that part, <b>become a Sahaja Yogi, tomorrow, to receive the blessings.<br>
May God bless you.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today, according to the calendar, is the day when a devil called Narakāsura was killed by the Goddess.<br>
And that’s why we have to know that what is Narakāsura in these modern times. It’s the devil that takes you to hell because he is the king of devils who reside in hell. So, we have to understand what takes us to hell. Everything that is destructive is responsible for our decline. Anything that goes against our awareness is responsible for our destruction. There’s a special blessing of this Pūjā will be that you will all become prosperous. Prosperity has to be balanced otherwise you will become like other Western countries, like America which is on the way of its destruction. In Sahaja Yoga, as you know, morality is the most important thing."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So you are all enlightened souls. For Me that’s the Diwālī. If the people are enlightened that’s the Diwālī: that they remove all the darkness of Kali Yuga and you all enjoy the beauty and joy of Kali Yuga.<br>
It’s very, very symbolic I should say, that Diwālī has already started. We have many lights, and we have to get more lights – not because it is short of light; why are we taking more lights, why do you want?<br>
Because all must be saved."</font><br>
