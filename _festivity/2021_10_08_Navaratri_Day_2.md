<font color="DarkRed">"Now we must understand the Mahākālī is in totality is the reflection of Ādi Śhakti, in totality. Or we can call it that Ādi Śhakti is in charge, <b>She’s managing all these Three Powers, but Her manifestation in totality is Mahākālī, in the sense that it is the Desire of God Almighty.</b><br>
So first She’s Ādi Śhakti in charge of all the Three Powers, and that’s why we can say that, when She is in a potential stage, She is Mahākālī.<br>
...... So when we do the Pūjā of Mahākālī, we must understand that inbuilt within this force within us is desire.<br>
So we can desire anything! If you want you can desire everything: you can desire, say, the joy, we can desire the knowledge, we can desire to be compassionate and love, and we can desire also the destruction of those which are negative forces."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">Now, when we are <b>celebrating the greatest of greatest this Navarātri</b>,<br>
there must be something special about it, that we have to cleanse this heart completely,<br>
fully and make it so pure that it purifies all the blood that passes through the whole of the body."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Now first of all you get your Realization, all right. Now you must know that Kuṇḍalinī Itself is the Mahākālī Śhakti because She’s the Primordial. <b>Mahākālī Śhakti is the Primordial Śhakti within us. And is the Kuṇḍalinī is the Mahākālī Śhakti. And She remains as a virgin within you. Means She’s purity: She has a power to purify. All that happens when you get your Realization. She starts manifesting Her all beautiful aspects on you.</b><br>
Now the one who is sitting there is Śhrī Gaṇeśh. Now people don’t understand what is innocence is. Śhrī Gaṇeśha is sitting there and He is the One who presides all Mūlādhāra, even over His Mother, because He’s like a guard."</font><br>

<p style=" text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"But Goddess Herself has done so many things for us already, within us, though we are not aware of it. Is said that, <b>"Yā Devī sarvabhūteśhu"</b>:  "All those whom You have created," means mostly the human beings, "What do You do? As what do You exist inside the human beings?"<br>
Now, just introspect if you have these qualities within you or not, because they are given to you by the Goddess, by the Śhakti within you."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So sincerity, though it is the quality of the left side, can be dominated by the right side, this way.<br>
The second thing about your desire, that it should be a pure desire. And the pure desire is very simple for you because I’m sitting before you. <b>The pure desire of a seeker is to see God, to be in the company of God, to be in association with God. As they call it Sālokya, Sāmīpya and Sanīḍya [Sanīḍa]: there are three words describing this.</b><br>
Va [but] without asking, without thinking of it, you have been given the fourth dimension called as the Tādātmya [sameness of nature]: means becoming one with My body, My being. So, that you become protected, absolutely cleansed and nourished in My being. But when you are not aware of it, then what happens: that I have to suffer in My body to cleanse you. So all other desires can create problems within you."</font><br>

<b>PRABHU MAZA MALA JEVHA BASE GHEUNI EKANTĪ<br>
When I am alone with my God (in meditation)</b>
MITI VARNU MALA TEVHA GHADE JI HO SUKHAPRAPTĪ<br>
The bliss that I feel is beyond words<br>
MALA PĀHĪ PRABHUSANGE, DUI ATMA TAI PALE DURĪ<br>
When I am in the company of God, evil runs away<br>
GALE SAMARTHYA MOHACHE NURE RUNT KUTHE VAIRĪ<br>
No temptation can dominate me and nobody can confront me<br>
MALA BODHĀMRUT PĀJĪ, SADA ]AEI NAVI TRUPTĪ<br>
Every time I experience the Divine knowledge, I feel more satisfaction and Divine Joy<br>
KUTHE CHINTA KUTHE DUKHHE KSHANE SĀRI LAVA JĀTĪ<br>
All moments of concerns and sorrows vanish<br>
PRABHUSANGE MILE JĪVA, NASE KOTHE TASHI SHANTĪ<br>
Nowhere else can my soul find peace except in the company (in union) with God Almighty<br>
PRABHU MAZA SWAYE NĪTĪ, PRABHU MAZA SWAYE PRITĪ<br>
My God himself is Truth and Love<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"And that is why, <b>today is the day when the Virgin, Gaurī, sat down to worship Śhiva</b>. She made a Śhiva Lingua and was sitting and putting Her sindūr on that: “That you look after this, which is the mark of my Union with you. I leave it to you, to look after” – to Śhiva. “You look after me. I surrender to you.”<br>
With this, that’s how Gaurī your Kuṇḍalinī surrenders to the Spirit: 'Now You look after this connection.<br>
I forget everything else. I leave it into Your hands. Lift Me Up. You raise Me up. I forget all that was Me before. Everything I have dropped out. No other desire. But just lift Me higher and higher. Make Me Yourself. The rest of it is not important. All other manifestations of this, desires are over. Now, I am absolutely surrendered to You, My Spirit. Lift Me higher and higher. Higher and higher, away from all the things that were not the Spirit. Make Me complete Spirit, full Spirit.' "</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"You cannot make anyone brahmachārī or brahmachāriṇī. It is a state, avasthā, where a person has to rise, like Yogeśhwara, like Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br>
......<br>  
It is a state of mind where you are not involved. It is a different thing, that you just load somebody with an idea that You should become, absolutely a brahmachārī or a brahmachāriṇī or you should lead a celibate life, forcing them.<br>
......<br>
<b>Celibacy must come from within, the purity must come from within."</b>"</font><br>
