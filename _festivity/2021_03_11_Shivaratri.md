<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is the day when we celebrate Mahāśhivarātri.</b> It’s a great day, or we should say great night. This Pūjā should have been in the night!<br>
It’s a great night when Śhiva was established on this Earth. Because that way Śhiva is eternal. So one would say that, ‘Why Śhiva, like a Birthday of Śhiva you can say or something, how can it be? Because He is eternal! He is all the time there!’ So, what demarcates today’s celebration, is the establishment of Śhiva on this Earth. In the material self.<br>
Every matter has been created with a Deity in [it]. And that Deity is established in that matter as you know. So, then it was thought by Ādi Śhakti that first, you must establish Śhiva: <b>without Śhiva you cannot establish anything. First He is to be established because He is the Absolute</b>.<br>
<b>So you have to establish Śhiva</b>, and now what should we do? How to establish Him?<br>
He is the God of Tamoguṇa. He is the cold, He is the God of all that is not active. So, first of all, this Earth when it's receded from the Sun, which was very, hot was taken very near to the Moon. The Moon is the brother-in-law of Śhiva. So it was taken so close to Moon that the whole Earth got covered with ice.<br>
And it was then gradually moved towards the Sun. When it was moved towards the Sun, gradually, then it started melting. And the point that did not melt at all was the point where Śhiva was to be established.<br>
That was predestined, that spot, and that was spot is the Kailāśh. The ice never melts there, and if you see, the whole mountain is like the face of Śhiva – the eyes, the nose, and everything you can see clearly getting out – and all the year round it keeps its shape as it is.<br>
<b>That is how Śhiva was created.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"How much blissful day it is today, that on the day of Mahāśhivarātri, all of us are singing Śhiv Stuti collectively. Śhiva, in fact Sadāśhiva is the beginning of this creation and (it) ends in Him. First of all if you understand Brahma, from Brahma, Śhakti and Śhiva, as within a cell is its nucleus, the same way Śhiva and Śhakti establish first of all within Brahma. How did the creation take place, how did this event take place, how did Brahma, appear in the form of Śhiva and Śhakti ......"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Existence comes from Sadāśhiva and unless and until there develops a condition for the creation of the world no creativity will take place.</b> First, the condition is made. Existence of anything has to be brought up. Existence comes from the Power of Sadāśhiva.<br>
Therefore, his role in creation is just like a foundation of a very big building or mansion. It is not seen, a foundation is never seen but without that, no building can stand.<br>
In the same way Sadāśhiva being Ātmaswarūpa – in the form of Spirit, resides in our heart. Our existence in this world continues till he is there in our heart in the form of Spirit."</font><br>

He is incomparable; He cannot be described in words. But He has a very big; a very extraordinary power which is not there in any Deity and that is the Power of Forgiveness. He can also forgive greatest of evils, to whom Gaṇeśhjī cannot forgive, to whom Jesus cannot forgive, even these can be forgiven by Sadāśhiva.

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are going to worship Śhrī Sadāśhiva. He is the Embodiment of Forgiveness</b>, so powerful that nobody is able to be against Him, to challenge Him. He forgives all our mistakes, no matter what they are. If He does not, He could banish the world because within Him there is a Destructive Power which is able to ruin the entire creation. Although forgiveness is His inherent quality this power of destruction could be awakened within Him as well. His Power of Forgiveness increases gradually until it becomes mature and then finally He is able to destroy.
So first of all we need to acquire His quality of forgiveness."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"When the Kuṇḍalinī crosses the Mahālakṣhmī Path, It comes up to the Sahasrāra, and breaks the Brahmarandhra, 
becoming one with the All-pervading Power of the Śhiva Tattwa. 
Because Sadāśhiva is on our fontanel bone, His ... His legs are resting on our fontanel bone area. 
When the Kuṇḍalinī touches His Feet, then the Śhiva Tattwa in our heart, which is the Spirit, is enlightened, and we get the enlightenment.
This is the Yoga, which we achieve through our uh Sahaja System.
And that is why we have now worshiped the Mahālakṣhmī.
After that, now we have to ... in ... we have to invite, Āvāhana as they call it, innovation, invite the Deity of Śhiva and Pārvatī. 
And then we have to put our hearts to pour its [their] love, which is called as Abhiṣheka, through the e... symbol of water. The ... the ... water container is like a heart, which pours the water all the time on the Feet, showing that, 
‘It is our heart which is pouring our love on Śhiva.’ By which we win Him over, and call Him, invite Him.
And after that, <b>we will give Him what He likes the most: is the belapatra, which is at ... leaf which has got three leaves on one stem. 
Which means: His Three Powers, Triguṇātmika, Threesh Powers. So, wit[h] our Three Powers, our Triguṇās, our Three Powers, we surrender ourselves to Śhiva. 
And, by that, we show that: ‘We give our triguṇas to You so that we become Guṇātīt.’<br>
This is what is the Śhiva Pūjā.</b><br>
May God bless you."</font><br>
