<font color="DarkRed">"Now what happens actually when you project this Pūjā? It has been found out, and now as I am telling you, that first, you have to awaken within you the Deities that are still asleep, by worshiping them. But as these Deities, Primordial Deities, are with Me, you worship Me, and every Deity in Me is awakened, by which your Deities are awakened. So first, your vibrations must improve, to receive. If the reception is not good what’s the use of any Pūjā or projection? So first of all we, sort of, <b>prepare our instrument or prepare our projecting instrument. That preparation is done by praying to different Deities</b> ......"</font><br>

<b>O Goddess of the Universe,<br>
You are looking after the Universe.<br>
You support the Universe, as it is Your own form.<br>
O Devī, The Lord of the Universe bows before You.<br>
Those Who are humble before You with devotion provide shelter to the Universe.</b><br>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>This is a worship of the Śhakti.</b> Until now many Saints, Sages have known and revealed about this Śhakti. Whatever they could not describe in prose, they tried to convey by poetry. Whatever description was not possible to put in words – they composed different names of the Devī and described. We know all this and many people also know the meaning of this. But one thing they perhaps do not know is that every human being has all these śhaktis, powers dormant in them and they can awaken them. These dormant powers are eternal and limitless.<br>
Besides the thirty-three crores of Devas, there are many Śhaktis. But we can say that this ‘Self-realization’ that we have achieved today, has been achieved through working of some Śhakti or the other. Without this, you could not have achieved the Self-realization."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now, when we are celebrating the greatest of greatest this Navarātri, there must be something special about it, that we have to cleanse this heart completely</b>, fully and make it so pure that it purifies all the blood that passes through the whole of the body. So the cells of this heart, which has made this great organ, has to be the best, because the cells of the heart within a human body are the best cells, the highest quality, the most sensitive. And it’s the heart that expresses the Anāhata, the sound that is without percussion. While we find that there are some people of caliber, there are, but others talk more, show off more, and do not have the caliber."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"I would say, with this, today's special celebration of Navarātri. Like yesterday you saw Śhrī Durgā's Nine Forms, also. In that, one is <b>Kuṣhmāṇḍā, is one of the forms, that you absorb all the filth in yourself, in your stomach. But the Devī does that, not you. What the Devī can do, you should not do, that's Her job</b>, that She is supposed to do this, not you. What you have to do is to only be in silence so that you absorb whatever will increase that silence, will increase your depth. The Devī will look after all the rest of the things, she'll look after all the filth, all the anger, all the temper, all the everything that's going on in this world. She will absorb all that, but what you have to do is to just enjoy everything that is pure."</font><br>

<p>
<font size="+0">Dear All,<br>
Jai Śhrī Mātājī.<br>
Today is the fourth day of Navarātri. Śhrī Kuṣhmāṇḍā, the fourth aspect of Nav Durgā is worshipped today. She is the one whose void contains the universe.  She is considered the creator of the universe. Often She is depicted as having eight or ten hands. She holds weapons, glitter, rosary, etc, in Her hands, and She rides a lion.<br>
Śhrī Kuṣhmāṇḍā rides a lion, symbolizing strength and courage in the face of adversity.<br>
Today we complete the recitation of the Devī Kavach.</font>
</p>	

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So we have made it short now, just take a bandhan, it is he same thing as kavacha you see. Realized Souls, if they take bandhan is the same thing. Whatever you have said here is done, yesterdays and todays, everything that has been said, all these rakṣhākari [act of protection] is done in one stroke.<br>
But now we should know how many of us take bandhan before going from the house, before sleeping or before doing something important. How many people take bandhan. Very seldom you forget it. Very important, going on a journey, going on a road, better take a bandhan, not that we are all right, Mother is looking after us, is not the point. You must take bandhan before doing all these things.<br>
If you get an accident, then know that you have done some mistakes, or something otherwise, normally there should be not an accident, means there is something still lacking in you. "</font><br>
