<font color="DarkRed">"I am with you at every step, at every place. Everywhere. Wherever you are, at whichever place you are, I am with you, completely, in person, by My Spirit and by My word completely. This is My promise to you. But those who wish to go to Hell, they will also be sucked down. That is also arranged. Therefore be careful. Take to higher life.<br>
......<br>
Even for a moment, I shall not be late but you will have to be Mine. This is very important. If you are Mine then I shall not be late even for a moment. I shall be before you.<br>
May God bless you all and give you wisdom."</font><br>
