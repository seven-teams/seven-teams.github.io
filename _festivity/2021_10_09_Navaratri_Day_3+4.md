<font color="DarkRed">"Now, God has created only One World,  He’s not created many worlds. He’s created only One World, this one, where alone here only human beings are created. So this is the most important planet, you can say, which has been in the Attention of the Divine. So the whole cosmos works out for the benefit of this planet. And the working of that cosmos has created this Earth, and then human beings, and then the Sahaja Yogis. So, <b>Sahaja Yogis are the epitome of the creative powers, they are the epitome of God’s Desire. That’s what He desired, that’s why He created this cosmos, this universe, and this Earth.</b><br>
So now His Desire is fulfilled when He says ... sees He being reflected through the Sahaja Yogis. But there is still a few things we have to clear out within ourselves.<br>
His Desire represents the Mahākālī Power within us. Now, we have to see how His Desire has worked in creating ourselves. First is the desire which is absolutely passionate. There’s nothing desired, nothing else is desired, but the creation of Sahaja Yogis.<br>
So, the first desire of any Sahaja Yogi is to create more Sahaja Yogis. No other desire should be dominant or exist, in a way. But to fulfill that desire, we have to fulfill some conditions."</font><br>

<b>There were nine times when the major Incarnations of the Mother of this Universe were manifested.</b><br>
They're manifested with a purpose. That purpose is to protect Her bhaktas, Her disciples, Her children. This was a binding love. She could not escape it. Mother's Love is binding. She cannot escape it. And She has to manifest it, work it out and give that protection to all Her children."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Tonight we have gathered here to do the Pūjā to the Devī, that is <b>Mahākālī we can call Her, or Durgā. So many types of forms She has taken, to kill the negative forces that are trying to trouble or to obstruct, or even to grow the people who were gentle and good.</b><br>
..All the people who write to Me, how they were protected, how they were cured, how they were helped. It’s this thing: that they should know that all this has happened because of Mahākālī Power within you. ‘She exists within you.’ When you are worshiping Mahākālī, you are worshiping the Mahākālī ‘within you’. With due respect, you must know that this Mahākālī is a very sensitive personality. She is very sensitive. If you try to do any wrong to anyone, She’ll guide you. She’ll tell you by many ways that: ‘This is wrong what you are doing. Why are you doing wrong to some person?’ But if you do not repent and come back onto the normal position, She gives you up. <b>Once Mahākālī gives you up, you are now exposed and become prone to all kinds of evil things.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"But <b>the Greatest Power that is belonging to the Mother is your protection.</b><br>
Protection from all kinds of things -- all the left-hand side protections are there. They are described, as you must have learnt on the Devī Māhātmyam -- what a protections She gives you. So tremendous in Her protecting power. And this protecting power gives you understanding -- how kind She is and how, I should say, how very-very protective, extremely protective. She'll guide you all the time that you should be protected -- on the left side. And through Her gaṇas She looks after you."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Pūjā of Durgā today that all negativity should be destroyed. <b>So many Deities build up the body of Kālī. Every part of Her body was created by a Deity, looked after by a Deity, and is also, later on, is reflected in you all. So they say that God has made human beings in His own image, I would say, I’ve made you in My own image, all the Deities at your disposal.</b> They’re all with you, and they have created you – if you see it minutely – it is the Deities who have brought forth all the beauty that you had. They have made all this beautiful congregation, beautiful transformation, and they have created such angelic people out of you. They are always working it out, but one thing you have to do is to have the drive. You had pure desire to ascend, but for what? You want to have the light, but for what? You want to become gurus, for what? To save people, for their salvation. Only through your channels I can work out Sahaja Yoga. If I could work out Myself, I would have. It’s not question of killing one rākṣhasa. God knows how many there are, rākṣhasas and rākṣhasas. And they are everywhere, even within you they were. Now they’ve gone out.
So you have to do full justice to Sahaja Yoga, that’s very important."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Now as you know that the Heart chakra has got twelve petals, and the Durgā resides on the Heart chakra. Now the Durgā’s qualities are that She is protective of Her children, She’s very gentle, very soft with Her children, and She’s extremely horrifying to the satanic people, to the negative people.<br> 
...... She is extremely gentle or She is extremely horrifying. So because She has a double function: is one to look after Her children, and She is extremely horrifying. So because She has a double function: is one to look after Her children, and another is protect Her children from the devils. So She has to be very quick about it, to fight them, and to, in every way to frighten them and to be alert about it."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"I would say, with this, today's special celebration of Navarātri. Like yesterday you saw Śhrī Durgā's Nine Forms, also. In that, one is <b>Kuṣhmāṇḍā, is one of the forms, that you absorb all the filth in yourself, in your stomach. But the Devī does that, not you. What the Devī can do, you should not do, that's Her job</b>, that She is supposed to do this, not you. What you have to do is to only be in silence so that you absorb whatever will increase that silence, will increase your depth. The Devī will look after all the rest of the things, she'll look after all the filth, all the anger, all the temper, all the everything that's going on in this world. She will absorb all that, but what you have to do is to just enjoy everything that is pure."</font><br>
