<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Pūjā should be done with your heart, feeling the love within you that you are worshiping your Mother, who is an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti, is a very great thing.</b> Do it with your heart, not with your mind. That’s why you know we do not allow many people to come for Pūjā, because that creates another whirlwind of rationality. Once you are detached from yourself, all your problems become so tiny as you see from the sky, from the aeroplane all the far-fetched things which are not so important. And the problems that are going in the houses down below do not touch you. You go beyond clouds and you live in the area of that space of Divine Love. Then all your petty things irritating things, all your so-called problems of live, all disappear and then only you can be effective more, much more effective, because you become a source of Divine Love. Pūjā is the only way I feel, you can stop your mental activity. Sahaja Yoga cannot be understood through rationality. Mentally it may be, but to become you have detach yourself completely. You have to go beyond it, because this limits your movement."</font><br>

Let Those Who Have Eyes See,<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>According to the calendar, this year there are ten days of Navarātri, not of nine. Nine are the days, in the night when the Goddess had to fight the demons and to save Her children from the effects of negativity.</b><br>
On one side She was Ocean of Love and Compassion, and on the other side She was protecting them like a tigress; because the times were such that nobody could meditate, nobody could take the name of God, nobody could think even of Self-realization. But those who are sitting here today, you have been there also in those days, and you were all saved for today, for this day, so that you can achieve your Self-realization.<br>
......<br>
So, like nine months the mother has to keep the child in her womb, for these nine months or you can say nine yugas, nine times, you all have been saved properly, and on the tenth month you are given your birth"</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now you are worshiping the Mother.</b><br>
To worship the Mother it is the biggest thing because all these deities and everybody are Her children, under Her command, under Her desire."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now the tenth Navarātri today is to celebrate actually the Ādi Śhakti. So today we are really going to worship the Ādi Śhakti.</b> On one side the Ādi Śhakti is Mahākālī, on the other side She is Mahāsaraswatī, in the center She is Mahālakṣhmī, and also She is the Ambā, the one who is the Kuṇḍalinī. But She’s also beyond that. She’s Parāśhakti, She’s beyond all the powers because She is the Generator of Power, so She has to be beyond all that.<br>
So today when we are worshiping Her, we have to worship Her in all these forms."</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Now you enter into the Kingdom of God. Then the Śhakti makes you sit on different beautiful positions, and some are sitting in the Heart of God, some are sitting in the Sahasrāra of God, in the Kingdom of God.<br>
Now you should assume your power. On Navarātri now, you should understand that it has now crossed the limit and now we are on the tenth position, where you must assume. I have told you many a times, now believe that you are Sahaja Yogis. Believe that you are, you have entered into the Kingdom of God. You cannot judge God, you cannot say why She does that, why She does that, why He does that. You cannot say that – that’s different. But when you sit there, then it is not an assembly, it is not like a politician fighting, no; it is that you have entered into the Kingdom of God, blessed by God, looked after, protected, nourished, and made knowledgeable.<br>
...... So Navarātri’s – <b>now, the tenth day of Navarātri, which is the most important for all of you, is where this Paramachaitanya has become active. And by its activity you should know it is become very powerful, and that now anybody who tries to be nasty with you, tries to trouble you – “I don’t have to worry at all.” It will take care of it.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"It’s very remarkable that, not only that you recognize Me as a Mother who loves you very much, but a Mother who is powerful to protect you. Is very powerful. If you realize that and if you feel that within your heart. Supposing I correct you some time, instead of feeling sad you should see that, ‘How fortunate I am that Ādi Śhakti Herself is correcting me. She’s taking interest in me. How fortunate I am to be born at this time, to be with Her in Her great work. What have I done [to deserve this]?’ <b>This recognition itself will fulfill all the Incarnations of Navarātri.</b>"</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"Last of all you have to pray that, <b>'Mother, we should recognize our Mother. 
That She has come within us. We are very fortunate and we know who She is. 
Please give us strength so that we recognize Her and imbibe that recognition in our life. 
It is not only recognition, but imbibe.' </b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Your first and foremost responsibility is Sahaja Yoga. Because you should know what a work it is. It is such a great work, to transform the whole world – that is My vision. And this old age I think the same.<br>
Now, if that is My vision, what should be your attitude? That we should go all out to spread Sahaja Yoga.<br>
That’s the main thing. I call you for these Pūjās just to renovate, I should say, to give you more of energy and all that. But if you are just taking it as a great blessings and sitting at home it’s of no use. You must spread Sahaja Yoga!"</font><br>
