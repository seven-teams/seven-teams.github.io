<font color="DarkRed">"But the Greatest Power that is belonging to the Mother is your protection. Protection from all kinds of things – all the left-hand side protections are there. They are described, as you must have learnt on the Devī Māhātmyam – what a protections She gives you. So tremendous in Her protecting power. And this protecting power gives you understanding – how kind She is and how, I should say, how very-very protective, extremely protective. She’ll guide you all the time that you should be protected – on the left side. And through Her gaṇas She looks after you.<br>
But on the right side also. Those who are on the right side, the Goddess puts Her Powers to put you right, to bring you back to normal conditions, to humble you down and make you understand that you are a child of the Mother and you have to behave like a child."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So many powers Mother has to have to protect her children and to look after them, These powers are all there, working relentlessly all the time-24 hours.  So anybody who surrenders to Mother, these powers express themselves and try to help you out of your problems.  But first thing is surrendering.  If you are not surrendered, If you are not in the kingdom of God, then this is not the responsibility of the Mother. Then it might be that some negative force might take over and may destroy you."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"The emblem of the Ādi Śhakti, of course you know, is a thing like this, you see, is ... we call it a ... a[n] elliptical isn't it. This is elliptical, elliptical. You all know that. But the mark of the Ādi Śhakti is the Half-moon and a star. You can put a Half-moon and a Bindu -- is a what you call a bindu? -- is a point.<br> 
......<br>
But that point is a star. So, you see, the Islam follows the star, the inside, and below that is this, what you call, they call it the Moon. But that's the half mudrā, or we can call it the half ......
......<br>
... half of the coil. But half, according to the Western mind, half means is bad. But half is the one that takes everything within itself. You see, the one like the bottom of the sea. Bottom of the sea is always bigger than ...
......<br>
... the sea itself.<br>
......<br> 
So this ... the Half Śhakti takes all the śhaktis into Itself. And the Bindu represents the Heart or we can say the Ātmā. So is the complete thing, is the Ādi Śhakti and the Bindu. That's the Islam seal. And in the same way this is the seal, this is the seal of the Ādi Śhakti, is a half circle. Is not even half -- we shouldn't say now first night's Moon and a star. And why this is used, because this is the thing coming from the creation, from the nature.<br>
So that also what we call Islam is nothing but is the creation of Ādi Śhakti."</font><br>

<b>Sahaja Yogis [suggest]:</b> Protection.<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font></font> <font color="DarkRed">That’s rather, protection is abstract, but this is a protection of the Mother is a concrete stuff, you see, kavach. So you take the kavach. Kavach is something you can say that people wear those armor, inside, you see that sort of a thing, is kavach. So you must take that before going out or talking to somebody. That you don’t do.</font><br>
