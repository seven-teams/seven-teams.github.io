<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So it is today we are here to enjoy our joy, our Ātmānanda, Nirānanda and Paramānanda.</b><br> 
All these we are here to enjoy, which are of eternal value.<br>
You have to understand that now believe that you are in the Kingdom of God and all the subtle beauties of your being are going to be opened out to you.<br>
You are going to see yourself all the beauty.<br>
But here, if your eyes are already closed, if your heart is already closed and you don’t want to see something that’s so beautiful, how can I say what a beautiful thing they have made?<br>
Is a very important thing in life, is to have a very positive attitude.<br> 
For Sahaja Yoga also. In Sahaja Yoga, we have to develop ourselves within."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Then the fourteenth day is very important, because that is the day the Goddess as a power, 
as a power, because it was Kārttikeya who killed Narakāsura, the devil.</b><br>
And he was one of the worst of all, could not be killed.<br>
So Śhiva and Pārvatī were married for this special purpose to produce this powerful Śhakti Putra, means the Son of the Śhakti, known as Kārttikeya.<br>
And He was just born to kill this horrible devil, called as Narakāsura. And He killed.<br>
<b>That is the day, fourteenth day. It is something like Halloween, that day.<br>
Because that is the day they opened the gates of hell and put all the devils into hell.</b>"</b></font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Mahālakṣhmī Tattwa has got four sides. ...... we have got the Rājalakṣhmī.<br>
Rājalakṣhmī Principle is that you are like a king “I am the realized Soul, so what! I’m like a king!” The kings don’t beg, do they? I mean if they beg then they are beggars, they are not kings. Of course these days I don’t know what the kings are doing.<br>
But, we are kings, we are royal. We walk like royal people. I mean I see people sometimes walking in a manner that doesn’t behoove a Sahaja Yogi, living in a manner that doesn’t behoove a Sahaja Yogi. <b>We have to walk with the dignity of a king. And the king is the one who gives, who doesn’t take anything. Is the Rājalakṣhmī Principle in you, has to come, in all the ladies.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"When this thing happens that you get some position, any power, even in Sahaja Yoga I was surprised. If somebody becomes leader, I don’t know what happens to him. It is a myth. There’s nothing like leadership in Sahaja Yoga, nothing like that. It’s just a myth. But suddenly people jump up. It is ego that gets pampered.<br>
But this ego can be easily managed if you worship the Rājalakṣhmī. She is the giver of balance. Firstly, She rides on the elephant. Is not easy for a lady to climb on an elephant, I have done it, it’s not easy. Without fear. And She sits straight with a complete balanced attitude. And Her blessings are tremendous.<br>
The first blessing one gets the imbibement of dignity. Dignity of a king, dignity of a queen. You are a queen so you can’t behave like street woman. With Her blessing, first of all, you get that dignity. That dignity is full of love, love for others. That personality emits nothing but love and benevolence for others, nothing else. Wherever She looks, in every glance She blesses people. She doesn’t expect anything. She is a queen, what can you give to the queen? She’s the highest of all in every way, what can you give it to Her?<br>
So <b>first thing is the sign, is that such a person has a personality that just blesses people, thinks of their benevolence, cares for each and every person who comes along. This is a blessing of the Goddess. Then the second blessing of the Goddess is that you develop a kind of a temperament, which is very dignified, but also very humorous and understanding what other people are like.</b>"</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="Purple">"So the person who is innately a king has the blessings of the Rājalakṣhmī.<br>
Then what does She do? What does She do to such a man?<br>
What She does is first his name is written on the hearts of the people whom he rules.<br>
She writes it with her own hand. They adore him, they admire him and they try to imbibe his qualities within himself."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Rājalakṣhmīs are the Goddesses who are looking after the country.</b><br>
Like England has a Rājalakṣhmī, too. Now, the, say, we can say the princess now is ... is a Rājalakṣhmī, he’s a ... she’s a woman with dignity, she carries herself with that bashful sweetness and all that, she’s a Rājalakṣhmī.<br>
Our Queen is very good, too.<br>
...... <b>A Rājalakṣhmī is a dignified woman: she is the one who is the glory of the country.</b> She has to be a glorious woman. She has to be a woman with all the attributes of a queen. And that is the Rājalakṣhmī: is the, is the queen, or the Goddess, that is the queen. And She resides in every country. Every country has a Gṛuhalakṣhmī."</font><br>

<font color="Purple">"So now you have entered into the Kingdom of God, you are now sitting in the court of God Almighty.<br>
Here, of course, as courtiers you have to dress up well, sit properly, should take up your seats.<br>
You have to be systematic and above board because you are Sahaja Yogis.<br>
You are not ordinary people. You are special people. How many people in this world are going to be Sahaja Yogi?<br>
