<font color="MediumVioletRed">"<b>Now today is the Pūjā, as you know there are five days they celebrate Diwālī.</b><br>
<b>The first day is the thirteenth day where it is the gṛuhalakṣhmī's day. Is a ṛughalakṣhmī's [gṛuhalakṣhmī's] day, that is the day when the gṛuhalakṣhmī is worshiped.</b> But a gṛuhalakṣhmī has to be worship ... worthy of the worship, and then some utensil is given to the gṛuhalakṣhmī. Some sort of a utensil is to be given to the gṛuhalakṣhmī as a present. That is the day Lakṣhmī was born, Lakṣhmī was born out of the Mother Earth ... a ... out of the, we should say, Mother Earth, but She came out of the sea, a... after the churning. So that is the birth of the Lakṣhmī, She is the giver of wealth: wealth which is material as well as spiritual."</font><br>

<font color="MediumVioletRed">"<b>Now first is the Ādya Lakṣhmī. Ādya is the one who is the Primordial, Primordial Lakṣhmī.</b> As I told you about, that She came out of the Sea. So that's what we call Christ's Mother was called as Mary, Maria, because She came from Marine. People don't know why she was called as Mary. My name also is, as you know, is Nirā, meaning coming from water."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="MediumVioletRed">"This Lakṣhmī was born, who came out of the sea, the great sea, which was churned thousands and thousands of years back. And She came out of the sea because She is the daughter of the sea. That's why She's called as Nīrajā. Nīr it means water and ja means `born out of it'. This has happened thousands and thousand years back that She was born.<br>
Now what is that? What is this Lakṣhmī? Is symbolically, what is it expressing? It is expressing the awareness. <b>Lakṣhmī e... expresses aware[ness]. And She came out of the sea. You know that: the awareness first started growing in the sea.</b> The life started existing in the sea, to begin with, and then it grew up. Without the life there is no awareness. First the life, because everything is jaḍa [void of life, inanimate, unintelligent], everything is dead. And when it becomes life it means it has awareness. So the awareness started growing in the sea. This is the symbolic expression. "</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"Then you have your wife as gṛuhalakṣhmī. So we have to have a wife as gṛuhalakṣhmī. These two things one should understand very, very clearly because we confuse them. Wife is the gṛuhalakṣhmī, is the one, she is the goddess of the household. Now she has to be the goddess also, I mean she just doesn't become goddess just by becoming. You have to become again. You have to become the goddess. And, <b>the Goddess of the Gṛuhalakṣhmī is, we can say, that the Deity of the Gṛuha -- of the house -- is a Gṛuhalakṣhmī.</b><br>
Now, this Deity must become one with the housewife. Then the blessings of the Lakṣhmī essence is of well-being comes to you. If she is not the Goddess, you will always suffer.<br>
You will always have problems; you will always have all kinds of untold miseries. It is Her blessings which brings you solace, peace and redemption -- redemption is the word -- of anything. So, that's why the left Nābhī is very important as we know and that is always bad in the West.<br>
So, I would say that the whole society is responsible for spoiling that because housewife is not respected. First of all, we should blame our society. Our housewives are not respected. <b>Housewife is the one who is a dedicated wife even placed higher than Yatis. Yatis are the highest evolved you can say, Avadhūtas, are the highest evolved Seers. And, a dedicated wife has got more powers than even a Yati, it is said so.</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>So the first is the form of a Gṛuhalakṣhmī.</b> She is born as a Gṛuhalakṣhmī, to begin with. That means the awareness, of human beings also, started really getting into evolutionary process when they started their family life. When they were vagabonds, moving about, then the awareness was just like animals. Though they had become human beings, but they were like animals. Then when they established their families, then the Gṛuhalakṣhmī started working and that's how the first Advent of Gṛuhalakṣhmī was felt.<br>
So She is the first Lakṣhmī who was born, and that's why on that thirteenth day is the day of the Gṛuhalakṣhmī, of the housewife. And so, one has to go in the market and buy some utensils or something that she uses for cooking in the house. In India on the thirteenth day everyone goes and buys a pot or, say, we can say, what you call, a cooking utensil or something. Or they may buy a sāṛī or something or gold or something for the gṛuhalakṣhmī. That is the day of the housewife.<br>
So, to reach the Lakṣhmī one has to understand that motherhood is very important. The motherhood as a gṛuhalakṣhmī is important. "</font><br>
