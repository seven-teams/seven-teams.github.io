<font color="DarkRed">"Today we are here, all of us, to celebrate the Diwālī, that is Dīpawali meaning the rows of lights.<br>
In the darkness of Kali Yuga when you find from every place confusion of the worst type creating the darkness which cannot be penetrate into, and which looks like a solid mountain around us, and which can never be covered, as we feel, by the Grace of God. And even with the Grace of God, it would never melt.<br>
<b>In that darkness, in that hopeless state, when the creation is on the verge of its destruction, the light of Sahaja Yoga has arrived.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today we have come here to celebrate a great Festival of Dīpawali, meaning the rows of lights, or the Festival of Lights.<br>
It was to celebrate the coronation of Śhrī Rāma also, that is to say symbolically to celebrate the establishment of a kingdom which has a benevolent administration."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>This Diwālī has been a festival of very ancient times in India. I already told in My previous lectures what are these five days are. After killing Narakāsura, Diwālī was celebrated when it was the darkest night of the year.</b> So now, it is very symbolic of these modern times because the worst time, as far as morality is concerned has been in these modern times. We call it the ghor Kali Yuga – ghor Kali Yug, the worst modern times. That means a complete darkness and, as you see around, you’ll find out that there is complete darkness as far as morality is concerned, but that’s why there are all kinds of crises. Because of that, also, there are many who are seeking the light, the Truth."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Śhrī Rāma’s crowning or any other aspect of Śhrī Lakṣhmī here now becomes your crowning, that is now you have entered into the Kingdom of God and once you are there then automatically as the citizens of God’s Kingdom you are blessed and as you become the lotuses then you start spreading your fragrance all around.</b> Now you do not keep this joy to yourself but you become generous about it and you go all out to give it to others. Generosity at another level, at a lower level is transformed into this Universal Love. Whatever you gain, whatever joy, satisfaction, vibrations, knowledge, all that you want to give it to others. You want to spread it because now you got the reality and you don’t want to keep it to yourself, you think it is very important that everyone in the world should know about reality.<br>
This is significant in putting these lights, that now you are the lights. It is the darkest night today, tonight is the darkest night, in the same way these are the darkest days, this is the Kali Yuga and it is the core Kali Yuga, the worst time where the worst things are happening, human beings are going to the worst level and at this time we have to put Sahaja Yoga before them. You know what is the ordeal one has to go through to break the hard nuts of the brains of people, but it is working, it has clicked already.<br>
...... Now you have to enlighten many lights, we call it Dīpawali, Diwālī is dīpāwali, means the rows of lights, and by celebrating this Diwālī with so many of you I’m sure we’ll have such a torch of light which will go around the whole world. Just remember you are not a small drop, now you have become the Ocean and you have to spread. Now you are sitting on your thrones and assume your powers. You have all the powers within you, you have to just manifest it."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So that’s the Lakṣhmī Day, when we say that Lakṣhmī Pūjān takes place, because that is the day you
invite the Lakṣhmī to come in, the Rājalakṣhmī:</b> the Lakṣhmī by which you become the king of the family,
or the royal benevolence, you can’s call it, the regal uh feeling in the family. That is the day."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So, today when we are worshiping Lakṣhmī, the men also have to know that they have to have a complete balance in life, that they should be generous and look after the people who are under their control. So there are, as I said many aspects, but one of them very important is that Śhrī Rāma killed Rāvaṇa on ten days before they say and was crowned on the ..., I mean today He was crowned today. So His wife was Sītā, She was also made the Queen, and in Their life it is shown how She remained absolutely dedicated to Him.<br>
So in Sahaj Culture we have to be special people, we cannot be like other people who are just running after money and doing everything just to ruin themselves. So that in Sahaj Culture we have to meditate, get our satisfaction about everything within ourselves and also we have to be like the Lakṣhmī children, the children of Lakṣhmī.<br>
So there are two aspects of this thing we have understood is that Lakṣhmī fulfills all our monetary needs plus also she gives us all the balance, all the joy, all the bliss in the family. Now the problem is with us that unless and until we meditate, unless and until we reach that state of satisfaction we cannot see the work of this Divine Power."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Lakṣhmī is born out of the sea.</b><br>
Now, why She was born out of the sea? <b>She was born out of the sea because Her father [the sea] is a generous personality.</b> Look at the sea. It spreads its wings all over, gets itself heated up completely so that clouds are made. And these clouds go and bang at those high mountains where it rains. They form the rivers and then they come back to the sea. But all this, while the sea contains all the salt within itself, all the salt is within itself."</font><br>

<font color="Crimson">"Lakṣhmī Principle that is understood, I’ve told you many a time, described Lakṣhmī to you that She stands on a lotus and She has two lotuses in Her hands.<br> 
That means She’s so benevolent, so kind that She doesn’t pressurize anyone.<br>
She Herself stands on a lotus – that means on the beauty. The beauty of Her being is shown
that She doesn’t trouble anyone, She can stand on a flower. So the first thing, those who have to worship Lakṣhmī have to remember one thing that they are not to pressurize anyone, to push anyone, to control anyone or destroy. But She with Her Feet on the lotuses nourishes the lotus.<br>
In Her two hands She has got lotuses. Lotus is a sign of beauty and they being pink, is love. So what does it symbolize? That a person who has Lakṣhmī, who has money, who has wealth should be extremely generous, like a lotus which allows a horrible gnatlike, black, porky, poking type, little beetle also to come into it and to sleep. And She provides in the lotus a beautiful bed of comfort to such a person. He is black, he’s got thorns in it, but he’s coming to rest, surrendered. And then She covers it with Her petals and makes it comfortable and protected."</font><br>
