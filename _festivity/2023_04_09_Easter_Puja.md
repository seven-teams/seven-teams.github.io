<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are celebrating the Resurrection of Christ. With ... with it we also have to celebrate the Resurrection of human beings, of Sahaja Yogis who have been resurrected as realized Souls.</b><br>
With that we have to understand that we enter into a new awareness. There was no need for Christ to enter into any new awareness, He had to come down and again to show to this world that you are the eternal life, that you ml ... lead a life that is spiritual, which never perishes. You have to rise into that new realm, which is the Realm of God Almighty, what you call the Kingdom of God.<br>
And He said it very clearly to Nicodemus that, "You have to be born-again." And when he asked: "Am I to enter back into my mother's womb to be born again?" And He said it so clearly! It's so clear! Those who don't want to see can remain blind! But he said it very-very clearly that, "No! That is, whatever is born of the flesh is the flesh, but whatever is born of the Spirit is the Spirit."<br>
I mean, nothing could be more clear than that, that it has to be born of the Spirit."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen"><b>Navabalala namana karuya</b><br>
In resurrection, Christ was reborn and to this newborn we bow down and salute in reverence.<br>
<b>Nave sumananachi mala arpuya</b><br>
By garlanding Him with fresh flowers full of fragrance.<br>
<b>Gani manohar tyasa gavuya,</b><br>
We will adulate Him by singing His praises<br>
<b>Hrudi mam basale prabhu majhe vijayi zhale</b><br>
He has now created a permanent abode in my heart because of His glorious victory over death.</font>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Now, as you know that He created all the Brahmāṇḍas. Brahman means an [a] universe.<br>
Now, the universe of the Sun, out of that universe has come out this Earth. Out of that you have come out.<br>
And in your Āgñyā chakra He has created a small Virāṭa, as they call it. He exists within your Āgñyā chakra.<br>
<b>This sacrifice is very, very significant. And, though it is gross, in subtle it has happened. To take the awareness through this center of Āgñyā was done by Christ, by His crucifixion.<br>
He came as a gross person, just like a gross human being.<br>
His body died, but did not die, because that body was also made of that imperishable Divine Vibrations, as you call, a Radiations or this Brahma. They did not die. And that's why the body did not die and He resurrected with His body.<br>
He had to die to show that the body though [it] dies, can be saved. That's why He had to be crucified.</b> Otherwise He could not have shown you.<br>
But it's actually it was experimented in the Vaikuṇṭha, as you call it, that He died and then resurrected to show that this does not die.<br>
Kṛiṣhṇa has said, "Nainaṃ chindanti śhastrāṇi, nainaṃ dahati pāvakaḥ" [Bhagavad Gītā 2.23, line 1]. "It is not killed by any weapon, neither it is burned by any fires, nor it is blown by any wind." "Na chainaṃ kledayanty āpo, na śhoṣhayati mārutaḥ"[Bhagavad Gītā 2.23, line 2]. "Neither, nothing can suck in." That Spirit is He.<br>
......<br>
But again you cannot crucify Him. Now He has become Ekādeśha Rudra as described, the Eleven Rudras as you know very well. These are all the Powers of Śhiva given to Him.<br>
<b>Up till now, till He was born, Kṛiṣhṇa had given Him His Powers, and that He became Mahāvirā[ṭ]. He was even placed above Kṛiṣhṇa.</b><br> 
But now, when He will come, He'll be bestowed with the Destructive Powers of Śhiva, eleven of them. One is sufficient to finish all the universes. And that's what is described as the coming of the Christ. You cannot crucify Him anymore.<br>
And the time has come for all of us to be prepared for us to receive Him. We are not yet ready to receive Him. Unless and until you are realized, you cannot receive Him, because if you remain unrealized till He comes, you'll be finished, you'll be gone, you'll be destroyed. He'll just come to destroy all the nonsensical things. So this short time should be used for your emancipation and for your development.<br>
......<br>
<b>For us, Sahaja Yogis, it is important to understand the significance of Christ's life. That His body was the only body who was made of these Radiations.</b><br>
All other bodies were human bodies. All the Incarnations, even that of Kṛiṣhṇa's when He came on this Earth, were having human qualities that Mother Earth existed in the body."</font><br>

<p style="color:MediumPurple; text-align:center;">
You were crucified and resurrected in pure Spirit.<br>
You rose after three days.<br>
You are peace.<br>
You absorb all thought.<br>
You abide in the Adi Agnya chakra.<br>
<br>
You are hallowed by Your Father.<br>
Your name is holy.<br>
You are Intelligence.<br>
You are wisdom.<br>
You are perfect humility.<br>
<br>
You guard the gate of our Mother.<br>
You are the Son of God.<br>
You are the only way to the Kingdom of God.<br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Happy Easter to you all.</b><br>
So we celebrate Easter to show Christ resurrected Himself. The Spirit that is Christ has to resurrect out of the material manifestation of the Divine Itself. The matter is manifested because we ourselves have created it. Not that we are born out of matter, our body, but we are attached to it, we want it, we want to have it. Whatever you want, that sustains itself, by your desire, because now you are on the stage. If you want to sustain the matter, if you want to keep the matter as the first priority, it will remain. It cannot disappear. It has to go out of your mind that matter cannot hold you any further.<br>
Christ rose out of the matter, came out of the tomb which symbolizes the matter which has enclosed us within, which has to be opened out with our spiritual power. Throw away the stone that is covering this grave. Get out of that and stand outside it. This is the message of Christ's Resurrection."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today is the day we are celebrating Easter. Easter is extremely symbolic, of – not only of Christ, but also for all of us. In that, the most important day is that of resurrection. The resurrection of Christ has the message of Christianity, not the cross. Through resurrection, Christ had shown that one can be resurrected with the body that you have. <b>And without His resurrection, we could not have managed the crossing of Āgñyā chakra, no doubt.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Easter is something like our birthday we celebrate;</b> when we became a bird out of the cage, of the shell. So Easter is our birthday we are celebrating, of our Realization, and every day we must grow with our birthday.

<font color="DarkRed">"The other day at the Āśhram I spoke to you about Easter, about the birth of Christ and His Resurrection, and the message of Christianity, that is Resurrection.<br>
<b>An egg is a very significant thing and it is written in one of the ancient Scriptures in India [as to] why Easter should be celebrated with an egg -- is most surprising. It's clear, it's very clear there, if one can see, how Christ is symbolized as an egg.</b><br>
Now what is an egg?<br>
In Sanskrit language, a Brahmin is called as dvijaḥ. Dvīji jayati: means the one who is born twice. And a bird is also called, any bird, is called as a dvijaḥ. Means twice-born. Because first the bird is born as an egg, and then reborn as a bird.<br>
In the same way, a human being is born as an egg, and then is born as a realized Soul."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Christ came on this Earth to say that we have to seek our Spirit. <b>The message of His life is His Resurrection.<br> 
On the Easter Day we give eggs to each other. It is very symbolic.</b><br> 
In Indian language a bird is called as khaga -- kha-ga -- and also dvijaḥ. The first one means the one which goes in the sky, flies in the sky. The second one means the twice-born. And a realized Soul is also called as dvijaḥ.<br>
<b>Christ has talked about your Second Birth throughout. He has said, "You are to be born-again."</b> "</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>This Resurrection of yours is much more blessed than that of Christ. He was alone, people wouldn't recognize Him. He had to show His marks where they had put nails on His hands and Feet. But today that is not the situation. Only thing is, first of all you have to recognize Me. That's all.</b> Need not know Me. It's not easy. It's difficult to know Me, but if you recognize Me, that's all. And it all depends on your sensitivity. <b>Your Resurrection has to be complete and you have to mature in Sahaja Yoga.</b><br>
If you cannot mature, I will say you should leave Sahaja Yoga. Go out for a while, where you will understand what's going on, then you'll come back."</font><br>
