<font color="DarkRed">"Now as you have seen that the Gods pray to the Goddess and She came and killed all the negative forces. <b>The reason was the earnest desire of the Gods compelled Her to take Incarnation. Such sincere desire to ascend that they could not get sometimes food even water and they worked so hard for their ascent which was disturbed by negative forces. So their call was so from the heart, so desperate and genuine and sincere that the Goddess had to take birth on this Earth to save them, to protect them, to look after them.</b><br>
But as it is we see, once you have reached a destination, you feel, ``Now better settle down." Now, what do we settle down with? If, <b>after getting Realization, you are complete, you are in Totality, you are absolutely one with Reality, there is nothing to be done -- you become a Saint. And a Saint does not need any advertisement, does not need anything. His Message spreads, people see him and know he is a great Saint.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"She came on this Earth, many a times, to kill the people who were doing wrong things, who were trying to kill good people. She has done Her level [best] to do that, and today we are celebrating Her birthday.<br>
You all know so much about it, that I need not tell you, but what you have to know is that: <b>She came on this Earth to save you from all kinds of troubles. For Her you were important, very important, because you were doing Devī Pūj. And so we are celebrating today this Devī Pūjā, with all our heart, because whatever ill people did to you, She came to destroy them. So today is a very great day for you to thank Her: thank Her for Her protection and for Her understanding as to what you have been tortured for.</b><br>
I'm happy you are all here to celebrate Her birthday, and to be surrendered to Hers so that She can always, always, protect you, and give you Her blessings.<br>
So may God bless you all, your children, your families, and that you bring great joy er [and] protection.<br>
It's very kind of you to have come today, so far away. I'm very happy to see you. Moreover, you have got tomorrow also that you can celebrate.<br>
Today we are not going to have any questions and solutions. We are just going to worship the Goddess, that's all.<br>
<b>I request Her to protect us from all kinds of problems that are facing us.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Now you have had nine Pūjās here and out of these nine Pūjās have we improved more, have we got more? Did we fill ourselves more with greater love, with greater joy, with greater understanding and with greater satisfaction?<br>
This is the last day, so you have to think like that, then tomorrow is the day of jubilation. Because we have done what? That is what. So today you should go and make a complete picture of yourself. What have I got in these nine days? What have I got? Let us see, have I got this? Have I got that? All these things, you should just within yourself see and then enjoy that you have got all these things. It is the victory.<br>
<b>Tomorrow is the day of victory. That you have become victorious about yourself and about your ignorance. You have won yourself and you've won over the ignorance, the darkness of ignorance. This is what is tomorrow's message.</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"But it's to be seen <b>now, that if you do not value yourself as realized Souls, you cannot value My time also, or what is Myself. This Incarnation can be wasted completely because of this materialistic attitude.</b><br>
In this modern times, I don't know what's gone wrong with human beings because the most important thing in your life is to ascend and to grow. Take a big vision of the whole thing -- why this Universe was created, why you were created as human beings, what was the need to do all these things, for what is it done. If you have a very big vision of the whole thing, then try to locate your position, 'Where am I?' And then, 'How the Divine has selected me and now I have become a Sahaja Yogi, so now, What is my responsibility?' -- that, one has to see."</font><br>
