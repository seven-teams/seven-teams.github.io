<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Today is Śhrī Dattā Jayanti [birthday].</b> Today is a very great day. I think this day has come only because of His blessings that Sahaja Yoga has been blossomed in you people. The Guru of all the Gurus – Ādi Guru Śhrī Dattā Mahārāja. I bow to Him, He is My Guru also. He has taught Me quite enough on Sahaja Yoga all through My many births. And because of that only I have been able to do some work in this birth also, continuing to do."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"This is a special mon... month in India, and it is nice that we are organizing this program during this month. Is called as the Mārga Śhīrṣha, means where -- mārga means the road, and śhīrṣha is the head -- which reajes [reaches] you to the ... to the Epitome. That is the month.<br>
And in this month they worship Guru because of His birthday of Dattātreya and also they worship Mahālakṣhmī. That means this is the month of Suṣhumṇā, where the people get out of the bondages of smaller hankerings and enter into a new path of seeking of spirituality that is Suṣhumṇā that is Mahālakṣhmī.<br>
......<br>
The gurus have to satisfy the Mahālakṣhmī Principle, which is just pure seeking of God, or what do you call the Śhuddha Icchā."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So these Gurus first started under the Primordial Master Himself, He was called as Dattātreya. And this Dattātreya is the One who is comprising all these forces: the existence force and the evolutionary force and the creative force, all of them, in its innocence. I don’t know if you understand it, but there is a story about them, is that there are three Deities which belong to these three forces. The left one is Śhiva’s force, then the right one is Brahmadeva’s force and the center one is Viṣhṇu’s Force."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"Today is the day of Guru Pūrṇimā. It is a Full Moon Day, that’s why it’s called as Pūrṇimā.<br>
The guru has to be like a Full Moon, means completely grown, completely matured.<br>
There are sixteen kalās or the phases of the Moon, and when the complete Pūrṇimā comes in, the Full Moon Day, all the sixteen kalās are completed."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So many people on this Earth came as Gurus as real Gurus the, manifestation of this great Principle of Primordial Master, as I told you yesterday is called as Dattātreya, came on this Earth many a times and, they tried to establish within us our sustenance our dharma with this, central force of evolution. Only through establishment of sustenance that we can evolve. As I told you yesterday about carbon, has its own sustenance, gold has its own sustenance that gold is not tarnishable, in the same way human beings have their own sustenance, these Gurus came on this Earth to establish that sustenance within us."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"In these spaces, Void, are born the Incarnations of the Primordial Master who is called as Dattātreya.
Dattātreya is the innocence of Śhiva, of ...<br>
... of Brahmadeva and of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, Maheśh, the essence of these, the innocence of these is embodied in the form of Dattātreya, who is the Primordial Master. So these Masters who are born on this Earth are innocence at its best, all integrated together. These Masters have incarnated on this Earth mainly ten times, but there have been many others Incarnations also, there have been repetitions just to correct themselves. As I told you yesterday that Muhammad Sāhab and Nāṇaka are both the same personalities of Dattātreya."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Maheśha (Śhiva), Viṣhṇu and Brahmadeva form the Trinity which incarnated as one Teacher God, the Primordial Master, Dattātreya. 
He came onto this Earth to teach people the secrets of the Divine, to reveal God, and to help them cross the Ocean of Illusion themselves within their own identity. 
Evolution could not go further in the hands of human beings who were in the bondage of ignorance, so they were given guidance through this 
Incarnation of the Primordial Master (Ādi Guru) again and again in different lives.<br> 
He was created as the three-headed child, Dattātreya, by Ādi Śhakti who appeared on Earth during the Tretā Yuga as Satī Anasūyā, wife of the Sage Atreya."</font><br>
