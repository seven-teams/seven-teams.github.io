<font color="DarkRed">"But Indian music cannot be without rhythm. First of all they have the vistāra, the expansion. But then, it must be built. If you doesn’t play with tāla, you are not regarded as a musician. You must have tāla.<br>
Because it has something to do with Śhiva, it has something to do with your heart, it has  something to do with Sahaja Yoga. You have to working with the heart, you tell that."</font><br>

Sahaja Yogi: We can sing all together, 'Jay Jagadambe'.<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b> All right, on this ... not without the harmonium, without.<br>
This is the praise of God and when you are praising the God you have to use all the instrument. You have to use all styles, but keeping to the maryādās that you are praising God. It’s a very nice Bhairavi Rāg for the ending of [Evening Program]. It’s a very good song also. But just now My throat is out, but I’ll teach you later.<br>
That joy, that joy, innocent complete. May God bless you. I hope already you have reached the Nirvikalpa state.<br>
May God bless you.</font><br>
