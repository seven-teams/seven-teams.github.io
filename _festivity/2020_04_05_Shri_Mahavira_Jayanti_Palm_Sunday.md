<font color="DarkRed">"Today I told you about Kuṇḍalinī, and that Kuṇḍalinī is the Pure Desire within us, that manifests or is awakened to give us our Self-realization. Means the desire is only fulfilled when you get your Self-realization. Otherwise, it is not manifested: it is just dormant, it is still residual. <b>It has created the whole universe, but uh until and unless you get Self-realization, unless and until you become one with your Spirit, you have not achieved the manifestation of this Power, which will go on making you run and run and run, thinking that you have not yet achieved or you have not found out your meaning.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Sahaj Yoga is not just for you. It is meant for the whole world.</b> It is not just for spirituality but to establish spirituality into this world.  Like Kabīr Dās has said, “Mann mamta ,” means "Left side, I will mix that in the five elements".  Means right side. The five elements are in the right side and “Man mamta” on the left.  I will mix this into that." This is the thing. That whatever are our feelings are and whatever our art is, we will mix it into the five elements."</font><br>

<b>Auṃ̣ Twameva sākshāt Śhrī Mahāvīra sākshāt<br>
Śhrī Ādi Śhakti Mātājī Śhrī Nirmalā Devyai namo namaḥ!</b><br>
O Divine Mother, You are verily Śhrī Mahāvīra. Salutations to You!
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are going to celebrate the birthday of Mahāvīra.</b> Mahāvīra is the Incarnation of Bhairavanāth, or you call Him as Saint Michael. Now these two Saints as you know one as the Gabriel, Hanumāna, and another is Saint Michael. One is placed on the Piṅgalā nāḍī and another one, Saint Michael, on the Iḍā nāḍī.<br>
So, Mahāvīra had to go through lots of search. Of course He was a[n] angel but came as human being and He had to find out the thing of the left side, and how the left side acts. It’s a very complicated thing, left side, is much more complicated than right side."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"The ascetic life of Mahāvīra was of a very, very extreme nature. He was the one who was born in a ... uh ... clan of warriors, Kṣhatriyas. And then He was also married, also He had a daughter. And then He decided, because He knew He had to do the work of the Divine, He decided to take a saṃnyāsa. So He took uh the permission of His brother because His parents were dead. He was a king, so He gave up all His uh material wealth, everything and He beg ... became a complete saṃnyāsī. And the He left His family, His left His ... house, everything behind and went alone with a little bowl for begging alms. And there people who joined Him were very few, and He asked them that, “You have to also become ascetics,” Munis.<br>
He was a Reincarnation of Saint Michael and He resides on the left side, on the Iḍā nāḍī. And He looks after the whole of it, right from Mūlādhāra onwards up to the Sahasrāra. <b>So Saint Michael was born as Mahāvīra, meaning ‘The Greatest Warrior.’ But when He was born, the whole place got lot of uh prosperity, that’s why He was called as Vardhamān, to begin with.</b><br>
But His asceticism was there because of the Brahminism that was so prevalent in those days, and people were absolutely drowned into it."</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="blue">"Now, why was He called Mahāvīra?<br>
Because only a person like Him – Vir means a person who is brave, who is chivalrous – because only He could do this, 
so only He could enter into the being fully and could kill or, you can say, destroy those horrible rakshasas, devils, all these negative things that come to us."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So we have to thank really very much Mahāvīra who has given us this power to remove our left-sided problems, who has given us this light in our hand which He Himself vibrates, and He Himself tries to throw some light on the obscure things – about Me also. Because of Him only we can get cured of so many physical and mental troubles. <b>You know that the left side can be easily cured if you use three-candle treatment. That shows Mahāvīra is only fond of light, He doesn’t like darkness.</b> And His idea is, I think that way, is to now fully go all the way to clear the left side as far as possible, to help Sahaja Yoga to be established in countries where I find still lot of this negativity is there, lot of it."</font><br>
