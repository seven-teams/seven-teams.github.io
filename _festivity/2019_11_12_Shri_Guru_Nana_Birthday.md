<font color="DarkRed">"Today is the birthday of Śhrī Guru Nāṇaka. It is being celebrated throughout the world with so much of zeal that I have not seen in India. For the first time, it has been advertised in so many papers and by different means.<br>
Guru Nāṇaka always talked of Sahaja Yoga. "Everything else," He said, "is just showing off." About religion He said that, "Observing fasts, going on pilgrimage, etc., are just meant to show off. Now you have to discover the power that is within you and establish it." Guru Nāṇaka kept on repeating the same thing again and again. He never talked of rituals."</font><br>

<font size="+0">There is One and only One God who is transcendent as well as immanent.<br>
True and Eternal Name. Creator and Person. Without Fear and without Enmity.<br>
Timeless Form, Unborn, Self-existent. Realized by Divine Grace.<br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"You have to educate yourself spiritually and Guru Nāṇaka prophesized just like William Blake that the Men of God are going to come during Kali Yuga, and there will be many Prophets who will be transforming Prophets, who will be transforming people into Prophet State – He had prophesized. They have all prophesized about you. Now you have to prophesize about those who are going to be Prophets."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"Today is a special day of Guru Nāṇaka’s birthday. We have celebrated one Guru Pūjā ah ... and, as you know that Guru Nāṇak was also the Incarnation of the Primordial Master, the same Spirit came on this Earth. And She’s [He’s] the one who tried to re-establish the work of Muhammad.<br>
Muhammad was the Incarnation of the same Spirit – the Primordial Master. He came on this Earth to establish the religion. Islam is the name of that religion, is the religion of every Sahaja Yogi, of every Christian, of every Hindu. We all belong to One Religion which believes in expanding our awareness to the new perception of collectivity."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"As Nāṇaka, Guru Nāṇaka has said very clearly, <b>“Kahe Nāṇaka bin āpa chinhe, mite na bhram ki kay.”</b><br>
Unless and until you see that, know Him within yourself, you are not going to be enlightened.<br>
You are not going to have any knowledge. The rest of it is non-knowledge.<br>
Knowledge is that where you feel the All-pervading Power around us."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkGreen">"As it is, guru were never treated with reverence, real gurus, were never treated with reverence, nobody listened to them, because they didn’t come to give you Realization but to establish [you] in your dharma. They didn’t have to give Realization at all. Like Guru Nāṇaka, whatever He said, those are true things just to establish you in dharma, so that you can get your Realization later. But people made cult out of them, everything is made thus. That’s not the thing. Guru is needed just to establish your dharma.<br>
But after Realization, you become the guru. That doesn’t mean you should show disrespect in any way to Gurus like Guru Nāṇaka and all who are Sadguṇ [Virtue]. At Their time, They were very much needed. If They were not there, there would have been no talk of Principles of Dharma. They were needed. Today you are realized, you have become the guru, so you talk of Them also."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Muhammad Sāhib Himself was born [again] as our Great Guru, Guru Nāṇaka. Guru Nāṇak was not a human being, He was not only a Paigambar [Prophet] but He was the Reincarnation of Ādi Guru, the Primordial Master, He was a Divine Personality. Of course, the people who were there at His time were so useless and gross people that they actually tortured His life and nobody followed Him. After His death is a different point. He also has said that it is the Primordial Mother who has created the Universe"</font><br>

Aarti - Gagan Main Thāl | Guru Nanak Āratī (recited by Guru Nanak)<br> 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72XrjKjT9ws">video</a><br> 
<b>Guru Nanak Dev</b> has imagined the entire universe decorated as a prayer platter on the altar of the almighty. The starting verses of the aarti are as follows:<br>
Gagan mein thaal, rav chand deepak bane, taarka mandal janak moti dhoop malay aan lao, pawan chavro kare sagal ban raai phulant jyoti kaisi aarti hoye, bhavkhandana teri Āratī.
Anhat sabad bajant bheri kaisi aarti hoye, bhavkhandana teri Āratī.<br>
<b>Means</b> - The sky is the prayer-platter, the sun and the moon are the lamps, the stars and the constellations are the pearls and jewels. The air coming from the sandal laden Malay mountain are the incense, air is the fan, entire flora of the earth are the flowers ...... oh ... what an Āratī is it! O destroyer of fear!<br>
