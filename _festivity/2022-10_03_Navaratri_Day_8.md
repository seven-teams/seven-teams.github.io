<font color="DarkRed">"<b>And on an Aṣhṭamī, that is today, is the eighth day of the moon, of the moon which is increasing, Śhukla Pakṣhi; that first time all the weapons of the Goddess are to be worshiped.</b> This was a great idea because these weapons who work all the time, not only to kill the evil but to protect the good, were never worshiped before; and that today, if human beings realize their importance and significance, then lots of problems of atomic bombs and all these things that have been created could be solved by diverting them to the right direction, using them for the destructions of the evil forces and not the good; also for protecting human life, nourishing human life. The same weapons can be used in a wrong direction; but, rightly used, they can be dedicated for the use of God’s work."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So the second thing is, [which] today we do, is a very great <b>Pūjā of Aṣhṭamī [eighth day]: is the day when the Goddess killed nine rākṣhasas together with Her eight hands. So today is a very special day for which a very special attention is needed</b>.<br>
It’s only at the behest of the bhaktas that the Goddess took Her form and killed all these rākṣhasas.<br>
Also with Her eight hands, She killed Mahiṣhāsura. That’s why She’s called as Mahiṣhāsura Mardini. She’s called as Nava Chaṇḍī, one who has killed nine Chandas, means nine rākṣhasas She has killed. So is a very important day and very vital and very deep."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"In the 'Mahālakṣhmī Strotum', why should we have all these. Because it is the Kuṇḍalinī. The Mahālakṣhmī is the channel of the Kuṇḍalinī, so there are Aṣhṭa Lakṣhmīs. Then Mahālakṣhmī and lastly the Dakṣha Lakṣhmī. We have got one after another these powers within us which are expressed on the Mahālakṣhmī channel. Now, in the Mahālakṣhmī channel we have to talk about Gaurī. Because Gaurī is the one which is the Kuṇḍalinī. So they have to talk that's why they say, "Uday, uday hey Ambe." They say in the Mahālakṣhmī temple. Why because, in the Mahālakṣhmī temple only they have to say that now you rise, we are ready, we are prepared, we have got the <b>Mahālakṣhmī Principle within us and now you can rise,' the Kuṇḍalinī and that's why the āvāhana</b>.<br>
'Pālan[a]' means mothering or looking after the child. She is the one who looks after the whole world like a mother."</font><br>
