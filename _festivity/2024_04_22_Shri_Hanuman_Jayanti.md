<font color="DarkRed">"Today we have come here to do Hanumāna's Pūjā. 

Śhrī Hanumāna is a great character in our being and He runs all the way from Swādhiṣhṭhāna to your brain and He supplies all the necessary guidance we need in our futuristic planning or in our mental activities. He gives us guidance and protection.<br>
......<br>
It is very surprising how a Deity like Śhrī Hanumāna, who is an eternal child, because He was like a monkey. His head was that of a monkey, if not of an elephant.<br>
So He was an eternal child and He was the one who was used to run the right side of human beings. He was told that, ``You must control the Sun," to begin with He has to control the Sun, that the Sun in the people, if there is too much Sun then He must try to control it and make it cooler or smoother."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"It is such a joy today, and the whole atmosphere seems to be bubbling with it, as if the angels are singing. And the speciality of Hanumāna was that He was an angel. Angels are born like angels. They are angels, and they are not human beings. They're born with the angelic qualities. But now, you all have become angels from the human beings. It's a very great achievement of Sahaja Yoga. The qualities that are born with the angels are seen from their very childhood."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are celebrating Hanumāna's Jayanti</b> [birthday].<br>
What to say about Hanumāna? The more powerful and wise, He was equally devoted and dedicated.<br>
Generally such a powerful person becomes right-sided and considers himself so high that he would not listen to anyone else.<br>
But <b>Hanumāna is a special Deity, a typical Deity full of qualities. There was a perfect balance between his devotion and power</b>. How could he achieve this balance is a thing to be understood. In Sahaja Yoga, when we are enlightened, we get many powers. Then we have to keep balance. We love others and with the power of the love, we keep on doing our duties.<br>
Śhrī Hanumāna was very powerful. He had many Divine Powers in Him Navadhā, that is Garima, Laghima, etc. He could be as big as he wanted to be and as small as an atom. He had achieved all these powers."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So in the left side we have gaṇas, on the right side we have angels. And translated in Sanskrit language or in any Indian language as Devadūt -- means they are the Ambassadors of Gods.<br> 
So now you are the same, you are all angels now.</b> Only thing you are not aware that you are angels while they were aware from their childhood. If you know that you are angels, all your qualities will start shining through, and you'll be amazed that the quality of standing by the Truth at any cost is so easily managed for you, because you have been given the right, you have been given the special blessings, the special protection from the Divine that if you stand for the right, and if you stand for the righteous, and if you stand for the Truth, all kinds of help to protect you will be given."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Even His sevaka [most obedient worshiper] Śhrī Hanumāna was an ideal disciple to be emulated by all the Sahaja Yogis. He was of Great Powers. He is an innocent personality of a very high order, always keen to perform the task set out for Him by Śhrī Rāma. Later on also He appeared during the Incarnation of Śhrī Viṣhṇu as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa and used to ride on the top of the chariot of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br>
<b>He is known as Chirañjīv, an eternal being, one of the seven eternal personalities. He also comes and helps and performs all the tasks assigned to Him. He is always present in all My Pūjās</b> and on one occasion He had been visible in vibratory form, in one of the Photographs taken in Bombay [Mumbai]."</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"We say that Sahaja Yoga is the work of Divine Love. It's right, whether we know it or not, Its power is innate. It is Divine Power. <b>When a human being bows before someone and regards him higher, it is the expression of that Divine Power.</b> But when a person is respectful to his guru then he gets blessed with the grace and power of the guru.<br> 
So <b>the devotion and the power (bhakti aur śhakti) are not different things. It is one. We shall say that the right side is the source of power and the left of bhakti. Śhrī Hanumāna had in Him this harmony of bhakti and śhakti</b>."</font><br>

<font color="blue"><b>Auṃ Ham Hanumate Rudr'atmakaya Hum Phat</b></font><br>
<b>Śhrī Hanumān, whose soul is Śhrī Śhiva Himself</b>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Śhrī Gaṇeśha and Śhrī Hanumāna are the Incarnations of this Divine Wisdom.</b> Śhrī Hanumāna was very powerful and fast and Śhrī Gaṇeśha is cool-natured. But when required, both are very big hitters. They remain with you every moment. Whenever anyone troubles you, your protectors are there. Often you see that security moves with the ministers and VIPs. The security of Sahaja Yogis also moves with them; that is, the security of gaṇas. Gaṇas have many things to do. Gaṇapati -- <b>Śhrī Gaṇeśha keeps them informed about you as to where is the problem, from where you are getting attacked and troubled. You do not know that if anybody wants to attack you secretly, even then these God's gaṇas stand by you. When Śhrī Gaṇapati informs about it, Śhrī Hanumāna sets them right</b>. So Sahaja Yogis have no need to be frightened. No need at all to be frightened."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So that is very important, especially <b>in the West where it's being really dangerously destroyed, the idea of auspiciousness and of holiness. So that is the power of any angel and that has to be fully established within us, and then on that power will work out, which gives you discretion, which gives you egolessness.</b><br>
I hope today both these things will work out within us in such a manner that we really become absolutely self-confident realized Souls whom I call as angels of modern times."</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"I hope today you have understood the subtle side of your being which is there, which is exhibiting, which I can see clearly and that you will, all of you will, <b>in your meditation become aware of what you have within yourself. That's the greatest thing that will please the Divine, and Divine will look after you fully. With the same confidence as the angels like Hanumāna you have to go further and work it out.<br>
May God bless you all.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="blue"> You are always at the Feet of Śhrī Mātājī.<br> 
You worship the Lotus Feet of Śhrī Mātājī Nirmalā Devī.<br>
You perform miracles to convince the Sahaja yogis that Śhrī Mātājī made them all angels.<br>
You are the most effective instrument for Śhrī Ādi Śhakti because You are nothing but obedience, humility and dynamism.<br>
You make all the Sahaja Yogis join Your company to do our Holy Mother's work and transform the whole world. </font><br>
