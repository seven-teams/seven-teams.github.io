<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So this Sahasrāra Day or, we can say, on the day the Sahasrāra was opened out, is a very important one, it's very subtle.</b> We just know about the Kuṇḍalinī, that She's coiled up in three and a half, and She's lying in the triangular bone known as sacrum. But we don't know what She works, how She works, what happens to us. She rises in six centers and breaks the seventh ... I should say She breaks the sixth center, because Gaṇeśha's center doesn't play any role. <b>So when She breaks the sixth center, which is the Sahasrāra, then She connects you to the All-pervading Power of Divine Love.</b><br>
<b>But what is this Divine Love? What does this do? It is the Energy of the Mother. We can say it is the Energy of Ādi Śhakti, which is all over, works through vibrations.</b> But what are these vibrations? It's a very subtle energy that starts flowing through your Sahasrāra. All the thousand petals of the Sahasrāra get slowly enlightened and it starts flowing throughout your body, throughout your hands, feet, throughout your body. And the more you are ... I mean your attention is, on the Sahasrāra, the more it works faster. "</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are celebrating the Sahasrāra Day.</b><br>
Perhaps we have not realized what a day it must have been. <b>Without opening the Sahasrāra, God Itself was a myth, religion itself was a myth, all talk about Divinity was a myth.</b> People believed in it but it was just a belief. And the science, as it was put forward, was about to obliterate all the value system, all the proof of God Almighty."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today, <b>it's a great day for all of us, the seekers, that the last work of the Divine, of opening the last center in the Great Primordial Being, was done on the fifth of May nineteen seventy [1970].<br>
It is the greatest event of all the spiritual happenings of the Universe.</b> It was done with very great care and great adjustments.<br>
It is not in the limits of human understanding, how things are worked in the Heavens.<br>
It is your fortune and God's Love that has worked out this wondrous miracle.<br>
Without this happening, there could not have been a possibility to give [en] masse Realization to people. One could have done it for one or two persons here and there, but to give such a [en] masse awakening could not have been possible.<br>
As you know, in the Sahasrāra there are the Seats of the seven main chakras. There are one thousand nāḍīs or, as they call it, flames, and they all have each Sixteen Thousand Powers. Every nāḍī deals with a particular type of a person, and, with the permutations and combinations of all these nāḍīs, human beings are looked after.<br>
As soon as Sahasrāra was opened, the whole atmosphere was filled with tremendous Chaitanya."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>When we enter into the Realm of Sahasrāra, then only we have [a] right to do the Sahasrāra Pūjā.</b> Before this nobody talked about Sahasrāra, nobody did any Pūjā to Sahasrār. This is your privilege that you are in the Realm of Sahasrāra and that you can do this Pūjā, perform it, is your right, you are chosen for this. It's a very privileged place for you to enter into the Sahasrāra of the Virāṭ, to reside in the brain as cells of that Sahasrāra.<br>
<b>Let us see what is the quality of the cells of Sahasrāra. These are specially created cells through the working of the Swādhiṣhṭhāna. Passing through all the chakras, when they arrive at Sahasrāra they are equipped to handle the brain's activity without getting involved into other elements in the body.<br>
In the same way, the Sahaja Yogis are not to be involved in the other cells, human beings, of the body of this Universe.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"To keep the Sahasrāra open is, in a way, very easy, as well as difficult. As you have known in Devī Māhātmyam that ``at Sahasrārare Mahāmāyā comes." She's a Mahāmāyā: not easy to recognize Her, not easy to know Her. She lives just like you. She moves just like you. And you can never make out Her real nature. She is in the form of Mahāmāyā.<br>
......<br>
<b>So, in Sahasrāra Pūjā, actually, you have to recognize your own divinity, that you are divine, by experiencing your divinity. How do you experience your divinity? That you give Realization to others.</b><br> 
It's a great experience to give Realization to others. Not only that you give Realization but you can tell about their chakras, you know what's wrong with them. You are quite confident."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So My own effort was to take you into that beautiful arena of Sahaja, where you will be absolutely one with your Self, one with the nature, one with the ... all the people who are around you, with your own country and countries. Everywhere, in the whole atmosphere, as they say, the whole Brahmāṇḍa [universe] becomes part and parcel of you, and you are not separated from that.</b> Then, they ... we can say the echoes -- they call nināda -- the echoes of your being, of your life can be easily seen, not in material advancement or in any other kind of a thing, but in the spiritual area which is the highest. Or everywhere, in every country, there have been people of that quality, and, till today, they are all remembered. In the same way, <b>you all will be representing a very great knowledge about reality: in your life, in your creation or in your working. In every way you can do it.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Sahaja Yoga teaches how to love and adore the human body as the Temple of God Almighty.</b><br>
Sahaja Yoga is the working of the Unconscious and there are some very stupid people who think they can cheat God. In return they are cheated by Sahaja Yoga, and to their surprise, find themselves outwitted. The play of Sahaja Yoga can be very mischievous, and creates many miraculous happenings as well as a great deal of uproarious humor."</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Sahaja Yoga was known to Me all along.</b> It is a unique knowledge with which I was born. It was not so easy to reveal it and I wanted to find out how to reveal it.<br>
First of all I thought that the seventh chakra must be opened, which I did, on 05th May 1970. It is a secret in a way. Formerly, the Brahmachaitanya was avyakta. It was not manifested. It was not expressed by itself, and so the people who managed to reach Brahmachaitanya somehow, by attaining `realization', said -- ``it was nirākār kā guṇa" ``you are like a drop that gets dissolved in the ocean."<br>
No one could say, explain or tell people anything more about it. The Great Incarnations also who came out of this Great Ocean of Brahmachaitanya, tried their best to share it with the best available followers -- which were very few -- and introduce them to this Brahmachaitanya. But because the Brahmachaitanya was not in avyakta form, these Incarnations got dissolved in it.<br>
......<br>
<b>Now I have come as the Incarnation of the Brahmachaitanya as a whole.</b> The sea of the Nirākār has now become a big cloud [Sākār]. It has taken a form. Those who came before were all a part and parcel of it. Now the whole has come. This cloud has rain water. The rain water is nourishing the minds of the people. Gradually they are brought to a level were their Kuṇḍalinīs have risen. They have got their Realization and now gradually they are feeling everything on their senses, their fingertips. This is the reason why nobody has talked about vibrations so clearly. They managed to talk about Chaitanya Laharī. This was so because of its avyakta [unmanifest] form. It was only a state. A state to be enjoyed, only in that state with no manifestation in the gross."</font><br>
