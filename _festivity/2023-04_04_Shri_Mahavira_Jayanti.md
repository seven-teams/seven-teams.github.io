<font color="DarkRed">"Even though Saraswatī has created all the Swaras, so what! <b>But the emotions it contains, the bhakti it contains it is due to the blessings of Mahāvīr.</b> Mahāvīr has really worked hard for this because he scared people that if you go to the wrong way, you go to hell, and on taking this correct way you will be overwhelmed and you all are actually witnessing it. Like this <b>we all should increase our bhakti and growing bhakti in the work of Mahāvīr. I am happy that on this day of Mahāvīr Jayanti you all are doing Mahāvīr's work</b> ......<br>
In Sahaja Yoga we recognize Lord Mahāvīra as the Incarnation of Śhrī Bhairavnāth. He also incarnated as Imam Husayn. Saint Michael is the same who is also called Saint George [the Guardian angel of London]."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are going to do the Pūjā of Mahāvīra, and we never had this Pūjā before.</b><br>
Uh the reason for this was that Mahāvīra's life was an ascetic's life, ah just like Buddha -- even more than Buddha it would be -- uh because at the time when these two were born, the Brahminism of the Hinduism had taken a very funny form. People had become extremely ritualistic and they worsh... [were] worshiping all kinds of stones and all kinds of things instead of worshiping only the swayambhu."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are going to celebrate the birthday of Mahāvīra.<br>
Mahāvīra is the Incarnation of Bhairavanāth, or you call Him as Saint Michael.</b> Now these two Saints as you know one as the Gabriel, Hanumāna, and another is Saint Michael. One is placed on the Piṅgalā nāḍī and another one, Saint Michael, on the Iḍā nāḍī.<br>
So, Mahāvīra had to go through lots of search. Of course He was a[n] angel, but came as human being and He had to find out the thing of the left side, and how the left side acts. It's a very complicated thing, left side, is much more complicated than right side. On the left side we have also seven nāḍīs, and these seven nāḍīs are placed one after another. They are described in books and given different names to them. Now these seven nāḍīs that are on the left side, as you know, they cater to our past. Say for example, every moment becomes a past. Every present becomes a past. Then we have past of this lifetime, and also we have past of our previous lives. Then all the past is built in within us since our creation."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Śhrī Mahāvīr resides on our Iḍā nāḍī and rules it. All the saṃskāras that we have in us are corrected by Him.</b><br>
He has defined and explained what is Hell. What happens when human go to Hell and what and how they suffer in Hell, He has explained this in very detail.<br>
Buddha and Mahāvīr were samakālīn [contemporary] and both of Them had a life of penance. Both of Them were prince. But still both of Them dedicated themselves in tapasyā. And They found out that, 'When human make mistakes and go to the left side then how he goes in Hell and how he suffers.' "</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>After they get their Realization, that He called as Kevalagyān: only the knowledge, only knowledge, means Pure Knowledge.</b> They will develop some Samyak Darśhan, means Integrated Personality and all the Collective Consciousness. He talked of all, all these things.<br> 
But as He belonged to the left side, He has described Hell very clearly. Fundamentally, basically there are Fourteen Hells according to Him. And is horrible to read all that, what He has described about Hell. Because He wanted to tell people that, 'If you do all these wrong things, you'll go to Hell.'<br> 
And He talked about, not about Form, Formly God, but Formless God, because He didn't want people to again start ritualism but get to right ... right to the position where they could get their Self-realization to cleanse themself.<br>
So you can imagine: how difficult, in those days at Mahāvīra, was even to be one of the candidates for Self-realization. It's frightening for you! <b>That's why I never had this uh Pūjā. Because to do all these things, first of all, and to become absolutely pure, then only He would give Realization.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>In Sahaj we very much respect and understand Mahāvīrjī and we also accept that He is the Incarnation of Śhrī Bhairavnāth and not only this, [but] He took birth many times and later also came as Hasan and Husayn. In Bible Bhairavnāthjī is addressed as Saint Georg and some refer Him as Saint Michael.</b><br>
It is very surprising that London which we understand as Heart has Saint George as its angel. That is! They accept Bhairavnāth so it's correct. Because if Śhivjī resides in heart then having Bhairavnāth is important.<br>
There are so many things which if we read with understanding then they are all interconnected and how is there relation automatically established.<br>
<b>In Sahaj Śhakti you get overwhelmed and you enjoy it and this makes Me happy. God has created this universe for you so you should enjoy it, what else do you want?</b> In you there are many powers and you use them and you have also shared it with others.<br>
In this way <b>the family of our Sahaj should grow. We should save as many possible, most important our children. We should take care of them because a wrong type of culture has started and the children are getting affected. So we should pay attention to it and to them and take care of them.</b> When they are established in Sahaj, then they will not go around."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"The ascetic life of Mahāvīra was of a very, very extreme nature. He was the one who was born in a ... uh ... clan of warriors, Kṣhatriyas. And then He was also married, also He had a daughter. And then He decided, because He knew He had to do the work of the Divine, He decided to take a saṃnyāsa. So He took uh the permission of His brother because His parents were dead. He was a king, so He gave up all His uh material wealth, everything and He beg ... became a complete saṃnyāsī. And the He left His family, His left His ... house, everything behind and went alone with a little bowl for begging alms. And there people who joined Him were very few, and He asked them that, "You have to also become ascetics," Munis.<br>
He was a Reincarnation of Saint Michael and He resides on the left side, on the Iḍā nāḍī. And He looks after the whole of it, right from Mūlādhāra onwards up to the Sahasrāra. <b>So Saint Michael was born as Mahāvīra, meaning The Greatest Warrior. But when He was born, the whole place got lot of uh prosperity, that's why He was called as Vardhamān, to begin with.</b><br>
But His asceticism was there because of the Brahminism that was so prevalent in those days, and people were absolutely drowned into it."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>""So we have to thank really very much Mahavira, who has given us this power to remove our left-sided problems, who has given us this light in our hand, which He Himself vibrates, and He Himself tries to throw some light on the obscure things about Me also.<br>
Because of Him only, we can get cured of so many physical and mental troubles.<br>
You know that the left side can be easily cured if you use three-candle treatment.<br>
That shows Mahavira is only fond of light. He doesn’t like darkness.</b><br> 
And His idea is, I think that way, is to now fully go all the way to clear the left side as far as possible, to help Sahaja Yoga to establish in countries where I find still lot of this negativity is there – a lot of it.<br>
So He’s working it out, everywhere, and the psychosomatic diseases and all these diseases also, we can work it out with candle-light and all that, with three candles we can do this treatment.<br>
So you have to be very thankful to Him that He has achieved this kind of entry into the left side and has found out for us what sort of problems exist on left side."</font><br>
