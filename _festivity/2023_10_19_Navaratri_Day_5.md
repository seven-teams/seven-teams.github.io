<font color="DarkRed">"Today we are going to do Pūjā for Navarātri.<br>
Yesterday you saw, beautiful description of Navarātri and how the Mother Goddess has created all kinds of powers within you. It's not that only She has the powers, but you all have the powers, and you can all work it out, you can all find out whether these powers are there or not.<br>
<b>With us, the Realization is very important, but there the Kuṇḍalinī has given you this Realization. Of course Kuṇḍalinī is a part or, we can say, reflection of Ādi Śhakti, and also the Jagadambā is also part of Ādi Śhakti.</b><br>
She's placed in the center of two hearts, which is a very important point. Now all these powers are placed in that chakra. So you imagine how many of these powers must be there, and Her Powers are expressed through the center Heart in all the gaṇas you have around your body. Now these gaṇas are the ones who do give you the protection, give you the sleep, give you the energy, give you the blessings. All of them are at work all the time, and these bodies are extremely dedicated and connected all the time to the Mother Ambā, we can call Jagadambā. Now She is the Mother of the Universe, so you can imagine, how busy She has to be to look after the whole Universe! "</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"The Devī has many forms, but is the Embodiment of the Śhakti. Ādi Śhakti gives Śhakti to all these Embodiments.><br>
And so, there are many Goddesses we have. At different times, They came on this Earth, and did all that was necessary for the ascent of people who were seekers.><br>
Specially, the One we know of Jagadambā, the Durgā, She was trying to protect all the Seekers of Truth and to destroy all evil forces.><br>
Because without the ascent of human beings, they do not know the Truth. And that's why, whatever they try to do is a mental projection.><br>
And this mental projection, if it is not sumsti ... substantiated by Truth, by dharma, it declines. In Sanskrit they call it glāni.><br>
When this glāni takes place, then Incarnations are born to solve the problem."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"You come up now to the Heart chakra. Heart chakra is divided into three parts. In the center of the Heart chakra resides Jagadambā Herself. But [in] the left side as I have told you resides Śhiva and His Power is Pārvatī. When Pārvatī Herself separates Her identity with Her Lord and enters in the center to save Her children from the domination of the evil spirits, then She resides in the center and She is the Jagadambā. This is called as ``Sacred Heart" in the Bible. She resides as Jagadambā. She has taken many Incarnations to save.<br>
Today there was Lalitā Pañchamī, they sang the song of Lalitā. The way She took Her Incarnations to fight the evil forces, to save the bhaktas from the domination of satanic and depraving personalities. She is there within you also, if not awakened She can be awakened. She is all the time there to save you from those satanic forces."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"This song that you have heard has been composed in the year of 1600. And in this song the poet has sung for the rustic people, in their language. That, ``Oh Mother, give us our Realization!" Jogawa means the Yoga, the Union with the Divine and the Sahaja Yoga means spontaneous.<br>
It fills My heart to see how since long the seekers have been asking for this Union with the Divine. What a search! What a seeking!"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"...... as you know <b>I am the Goddess, and the Goddess has to wear I don't know how many ornaments just to adorn Her chakras.</b> I mean, I have lots of ornaments Myself of My own. But only for Pūjā I wear, otherwise I don't wear: I am supposed to wear lots of things. Why? Because it may not be that -- all right, may be dignified, but may not be that all right to wear all those things all the time. But I am supposed to wear."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"...... I would like to tell you about the meaning of Pūjā. There are two aspects. One is the aspect that you have got your own Deities within you inside. And these Deities are to be awakened within you. Deities are the different aspects of One God. So, on one side you have the Deities -- is the aspects of God, which are all the time awakened. On the other side you have your own Deities, which are sometimes awakened, sometimes half awakened, sometimes sleeping and sometimes sick. [Laughter.] So, you have to use two methods -- one to please the Deities of God and to ask them to bless your Deities or to ask them to awaken your Deities."</font><br>
