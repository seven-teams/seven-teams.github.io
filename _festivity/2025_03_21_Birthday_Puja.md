<font color="DarkRed">"<b>The birthday of your Mother, and all such celebrations have a very deep significance, because on such occasions, special vibrations flow in the atmosphere.</b> When all the celestial bodies, the Eternal Personalities, Gods and Goddesses, sing the praise, and that’s how the whole atmosphere is filled with mirth and happiness. Human beings also, express there gratitude. Expression of gratitude and love is done in different, different ways in different countries, but the substance remains the same and the forms change.<br>
The substance is like the ocean which flows continuously towards the shores and the ripples which touch the shores are again repelled back, and a nice pattern is formed. It is such a spontaneous thing and is so beautiful, creates such a beautiful pattern in the atmosphere. All these waves when they weave together the pattern of love they soothe human beings, they enchant human beings and the whole thing is very blissful.<br>
On such occasions a special type of feelings develop, which we cannot express in words so the expression could be in any form. But the main thing is the expression. <b>God has expressed Himself by Creation, by creating this Creation. While the Creation has to express its gratitude by glorifying Him, and this play must go on eternally. It’s the most beautiful play.</b> Those who indulge into this play lead an eternal life.<br>
That life is unending, never breaks and binds the whole universe with it’s beautiful music."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"With your good wishes, with your prayers, this world will be so beautiful, so enchanting, that, <b>in the history, people will describe that,
 ‘The world itself became a lotus, full of fragrance of Divinity.’
You are the petals, you are the corona, you are the color, you are the beauty, you are the pollen of that beautiful lotus, which is My vision of this world.</b><br>
I hope, today, you all will decide to work for Sahaja Yoga, to spread Sahaja Yoga, and work for yourself also.<br>
The only danger is: that one should not allow ego to sit on your heads. That’s the only horse.<br>
If you could ride yourself and don’t ... don’t allow the horse to ride you, you’ll progress very fast, beautifully.<br>
<b>Thus, I am sure, Sahaja Yoga will spread.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>On My birthday today, I request you all to grow with Me. Grow in age. It means that you should become mature.</b> You have become one-pointed. So that is all right. This one-pointedness means that you have the chakras and the enlightenment of each one chakra. To raise the Kuṇḍalinī whereby it passes through the chakras and goes into the Sahasrāra, just think what a great thing it is. No Saint, Sage, Ṛiṣhi, Yogi, or any Incarnation has done what you people are doing. So much power has come within you. But we should have the endurance to bear this Power. The greater the voltage we can bear, the greater the voltage that will come within us. We can increase this voltage tremendously. And this year has come with a special significance. That’s why I have said all this to you, that how you can blossom fully your life, from within and outside."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So today I am asking for two things from you. It is a funny thing that Mother has to ask for a gift.<br>
The first gift you have to give is that you should express peacefulness through your own character.</b> But it does not mean that you should be people who are timid, or people who are morbid or who tolerate nonsense. No, but the people who are peaceful resistance. You are not afraid of anything. You are not going to bow down to anything, compromise with anything, but you have that sort of a temperament you should develop and express -- is very important.<br>
<b>And the second one is that this peace and all this should express your love. Love to others.</b>"</font><br>
