<b>Sahaja Yogi:</b> Today it’s said it’s Anant Chaturdaśhī.<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b> Ah?</font><br>
<b>Sahaja Yogi:</b> Anant Chaturdaśhī.<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b> Today? Ah-ah! That’s great! Yes must be. I was wondering Anant Chaturdaśhī. <b>Anant Chaturdaśhī is the day when we visarjan – dissolve Śhrī Gaṇeśha in the water.</b><br>
Gaṇeśhjī ko chodte hai na pani mein – it’s that day we put the Gaṇeśha in to the water.<br>
Because <b>He’s established for ten days and after ten days</b>, He’s born on the fourth, after ten days He’s dissolved in the water so that everywhere His Power is spread through the water.<br>
That’s why no wonder there was a Pūjā.<br>
Gaṇeśha settled down into the water. That is Ananta Chaturdaśhī. Ananta is the, is Śhrī Gaṇeśha.<br>
Ananta means which cannot be destroyed. Innocence cannot be destroyed. And that is why is the Gaṇeśh Chaturdaśhī means the day when Gaṇeśha is dissolved in the water, in the ocean or He is created, worshiped for ten days and again given back. So it’s a very great day today, I should say, like the Resurrection of Christ that you are, you had Christ here, He lived with you, and then went back to His Father. Father is the ocean and that’s what in India they do, <b>establish Him on the fourth day and on the tenth day they put Him back to the ocean</b>."</font><br>

You are Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra; You are Indra, Agni, Vayu; You are the sun at noon,<br>
You are the full moon; through all of these and more,<br>
You are the all-pervading energy of innocence and wisdom.<br>
This is the knowledge of Nirmal Ganesh, and You, Nirmal Ganesh, are the master of that knowledge, and all knowledge.<br>
You are the God and You are the Goddess.

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Establish Śhrī Gaṇeśha within you.</b> First of all, you must establish Him and then you can use it for others, for yourself, and for bettering and bettering the methods of Sahaja Yoga that you have learned.<br>
That’s how Śhrī Gaṇeśha is so important for all the Sahaja Yogis to be understood in all its aspects, but this principle is very enormous I should say. The principle is very spread out, it’s very subtle, so to understand in all its aspects is not an easy thing. The only thing you can do is to become One with it, like the Ocean. If you become One with the Ocean you become the Ocean. Just become One with it and that’s how it works out."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"To manifest Śhrī Gaṇeśha, we have to do certain amount of tapasyā, penance. First we have to say, when we sit for meditation, that, <b>'I am going to be worthy of Your appreciation. Make me humble, so that I am appreciated by You, and my only desire is to please You.'</b> Then you sit down in complete preparedness, meditating over your Mūlādhāra, putting your attention to it with Absolute Purity. Now you have My Photograph before you and you tell the Photograph, <b>'Mother, You are Śhrī Gaṇeśha. You give me wisdom and discretion.'</b></font><br>

<p style=" text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Only in your Āratī, in Marathi</b>, of Śhrī Gaṇeśha, they say that, “At the time when I am getting my Realization you must save me.” That’s the only thing they ask, "At the time of my Resurrection you must save me." It does not say that, 'At the time of my Resurrection you protect me,' no! "You save me."<br>
Because He’s the one who is sitting on every chakra like a vice-chancellor of the university.<br>
Even if you have Viṣhṇu on your side, Mahādeva on your side, but if Śhrī Gaṇeśha is there sitting and He says, ‘No, not his ascent,’ it doesn’t work out, it’s very difficult."</font><br>
