<font color="DarkRed">"<b>The significance of Diwālī is spread out in about five days.</b><br>
......<br>
And they are all together somehow, these five days are all put together. <b>So they have different aspects, but in every aspect there's one common point is that the Goddess plays the main role.</b> Now the first day is the worship of the housewife where you have to buy some sort of a utensil for the kitchen or for the use of the wife or could be a present for the wife, but is said that woman must be respected, but they should be respectable. If they are not respectable how can they be respected."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Since time immemorial, the festival of Diwālī has been celebrated in our country. However, the 'dīpāwali' [arrangement of lamps] of <b>Diwālī started with the beginning of Sahaja Yoga</b>. The lamps that were lit during Diwālī used to get extinguished in some time. The next year, Diwālī would be celebrated by putting oil and a wick in a new lamp. In this manner, every year, new lamps used to be bought. The speciality of the lamp was that at first, it would be put in water and made completely wet and then dried so that the lamp does not absorb the oil in it. It then used to burn for a long time. 

But we have been celebrating the Diwālī of the heart since Sahaja Yoga started. <b>The heart is the lamp which has the wick and we light it by putting in the oil of love.</b> But before putting in this oil, we have to cleanse the heart completely of all impurities and then decorate it beautifully. When this love is firmly established in our hearts, then the heart does not absorb it. When someone loves you, for example, at first your mother loves you, your father loves you and then some others also love you, you absorb that love within yourself. The love that you get from your husband or your wife, settles down in every pore of your body. However, that love is just restricted to you and others don't get its light.<br>
......<br>
However, <b>when the soft love of Sahaja Yoga is filled in the lamp of the heart, it is no longer restricted to oneself. When it starts burning with the light of the Spirit, it has the ability to light up the entire universe. Such a heart becomes empowered then, to light up the entire universe, to radiate its light throughout the universe, to destroy ignorance in the universe and to spread joy in the whole universe</b>. The same lamp that was broken every year [after Diwālī] now becomes an empowered and a special lamp that does not get extinguished at all. This lamp lights up many other lamps and even those lamps burn for all eternity."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>A Gṛuhalakṣhmī should be a scintillating woman.</b> Her life should be such that the husband should feel that there is something tremendous in the house which will not allow me to take to wrong ways. In the old days, men used to call their wives as 'mālak' [master or owner] and 'sāhib.' There used to be great respect for the wife. How was it so? It was not because the wife used to shout but it was <b>because of her brilliance. It was because of her nobility, composure, generosity, devotion, service and love. A woman has a scintillating character because of these qualities.</b>"</font><br>

Now, any housewife need not be Gṛuhalakṣhmī. She can be a shrew, She can be a horrid thing. <b>The Deity of the Household, if She resides in you, then you are Gṛuhalakṣhmī, otherwise you are not.</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"The woman has to be a gṛuhalakṣhmī herself, and then she should be worshiped. <b>"Yatra narya[stu] pujyante tatra ramante Devatā." "Where the women are respected and worshiped, there reside all the Deities."</b> But they should be respectable also. If they are not respectable, then the Deities won't reside there. It's a big responsibility on a Gṛuhalakṣhmī to be the respectable, so that all the Deities are happy in the family. And once she is respected, she will try to be respectable also. So, the respect of the gṛuhalakṣhmī is very important."</font><br>
