<font color="DarkRed">"Today is a very auspicious day. It is Lalitā Pañchami. Lalit means beautiful, very beautiful and <b>Lalitā is Śhrī Gaurī’s name and because tomorrow is Śhrī Gaṇeśha’s Birthday that is why today is celebrated for Śhrī Gaurī. Anyways you also know that My Kuṇḍalinī means Kuṇḍalii and Its name is Lalitā.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"Lālitya is a name for beauty. Human beings are that beauty, that person who has a sense of gratitude is the most beautiful. The person who does not have a sense of gratitude is equal to an animal. Animals also have it. Dogs also have it. If you take care of a dog for a few days you will be surprised that it will be loyal to you. Once you have this sense of gratitude awakened in you, then you will see love coming from within you. Lot of people say that, “Mother we are surrendered to you.” I laugh at them. What will you surrender to Me? I never asked you for anything. I am here to give and I have no part in it. But Lord Almighty watches you whether you have that sense of gratitude or not. When you do not have that then all My recommendations for you to him are ignored. That is why lot of people who think they have received Self-realization, they have evolved, are at the same place. They are walking the same. It is very important to awaken the sense of gratitude in you. Without that everything is ugly. Lalitā ends with that. Such people cannot achieve Lalitā who do not have a sense of gratitude. This sense of gratitude is very important."</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"So Mahākālī Śhakti sits on many points. They have their various vehicles. But when She sits on an elephant She is called Lalitā Gaurī. Her art, skill, and feeling, are all respectably beautiful. It is not necessary that you wear a Veil. It is not necessary that you cover your head. But in your eyes there should be śhālīnatā. Śhālīn is a very big word. Many things are covered in this. Because the one who is Rudra Swarūp, she should also become Saumya Swarūpa [tender]."</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"Let us consider the word ‘La’. It is Lalitā’s word. My second name is Lalitā. It is the blessing of Devī. It is Her weapon. When La, i.e., Goddess becomes Lalit or when the Śhakti becomes La it which means active that is when the vibrations rise within Her the vibrations which you are feeling on your palms that śhakti is Lalitā Śhakti. It is full of beauty and love. When the Power of Love becomes active, it becomes La Śhakti. She envelops you from all sides. When she is active, what is the worry? What is your power? Can you make even one fruit from tree? Leave, fruit, you cannot make even a leaf or a root! Only ‘La Śhakti’ does all the work. The Realization that you have got is also from this power. From this Śhakti have come ‘Ma Śhakti’ and ‘Nih Śhakti’."</b></font><br>
