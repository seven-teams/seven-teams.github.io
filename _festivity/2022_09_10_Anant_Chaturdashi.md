<b>Sahaja Yogi:</b> Mother, today is said it's Anant Chaturdaśhī.<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> <font color="DarkRed">Huh?</font><br>
<b>Sahaja Yogi:</b> Anant Chaturdaśhī.<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> <font color="DarkRed">Today? Aah-ha! That's great! Yes must be. I was wondering Anant Chaturdaśhī. Anant Chaturdaśhī is the day when we visarjan, dissolve Śhrī Gaṇeśha in the water. Gaṇeśhjī ko choṛate hai na pānī meṃ [it's that day we put Gaṇeśhjī in to the water]. Because He's established for ten days. And after ten days, He's born on the fourth, after ten days He's dissolved in the water so that everywhere His Power is spread through the water.</font><br>
T<font color="DarkRed">hat's why no wonder there was a Pūjā.</font> [Laughter.]<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Gaṇeśha settled down into the water. [Laughs.] That is Ananta Chaturdaśhī. Ananta is the, is Śhrī Gaṇeśha. Ananta means which cannot be destroyed. Innocence cannot be destroyed.</b> And that is why is the Gaṇeśh Chaturdaśhī, means the day when Gaṇeśha is dissolved in the water, in the ocean or He is created, worshiped for ten days and again given back. So it's a very great day today, I should say, like the Resurrection of Christ that you are, you had Christ here, He lived with you, and then went back to His Father. Father is the ocean and that's what in India they do, to establish Him on the fourth day and on the tenth day they put Him back to the ocean.</font><br>

<font size="+0"><b>The Leader of the [Bhūta]-Gaṇa, the Lord of the people, the representative of the people, I meditate on you.<br>
The embodiment of Guna (the three qualities of Sattva, Rāja, and Tamas), the one adorned with Guṇa, the lord of Guṇas, I meditate on you.<br>
The one beyond Guna, the controller of Guṇa, the one in whom Guṇa pervades, I meditate on you.<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So today first we have Gaṇesh Pūjā because <b>Gaṇesha is innocence and we have to establish Him in any place where we want to start a work or do anything about it because He is innocence and innocence was created before everything else was created.

<font color="DarkGreen"><b>You are the One to be worshipped first. Obeisance to You again and again.<br>
You are the Word that was in the beginning. You are the Oṃkāra.<br>
You are the source of life. You are the source of security.</b></font>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Only thing, it is for you to respect it, to behave in a manner that you respect your innocence. Not to feel shy about your innocence, never. Your innocence itself is a power and your innocence will definitely give you that wisdom by which you can solve all the problems without any difficulty."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Establish Śhrī Gaṇeśha within you.</b> First of all, you must establish Him and then you can use it for others, for yourself, and for bettering and bettering the methods of Sahaja Yoga that you have learned.<br>
That’s how Śhrī Gaṇeśha is so important for all the Sahaja Yogis to be understood in all its aspects, but this principle is very enormous I should say. The principle is very spread out, it’s very subtle, so to understand in all its aspects is not an easy thing. The only thing you can do is to become One with it, like the Ocean. If you become One with the Ocean you become the Ocean. Just become One with it and that’s how it works out."</font><br>
