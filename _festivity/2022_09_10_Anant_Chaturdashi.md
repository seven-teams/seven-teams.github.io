<b>Gavin Brown:</b> Mother, today is said it's Anant Chaturdaśhī.<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> Huh?<br>
<b>Gavin Brown:</b> Anant Chaturdaśhī.<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> Today? Aah-ha! That's great! Yes must be. I was wondering Anant Chaturdaśhī. Anant Chaturdaśhī is the day when we visarjan, dissolve Śhrī Gaṇeśha in the water. Gaṇeśhjī ko choṛate hai na pānī meṃ [it's that day we put Gaṇeśhjī in to the water]. Because He's established for ten days. And after ten days, He's born on the fourth, after ten days He's dissolved in the water so that everywhere His Power is spread through the water.<br>
That's why no wonder there was a Pūjā. [Laughter.]<br>
Gaṇeśha settled down into the water. [Laughs.] That is Ananta Chaturdaśhī. Ananta is the, is Śhrī Gaṇeśha. Ananta means which cannot be destroyed. Innocence cannot be destroyed. And that is why is the Gaṇeśh Chaturdaśhī, means the day when Gaṇeśha is dissolved in the water, in the ocean or He is created, worshiped for ten days and again given back. So it's a very great day today, I should say, like the Resurrection of Christ that you are, you had Christ here, He lived with you, and then went back to His Father. Father is the ocean and that's what in India they do, to establish Him on the fourth day and on the tenth day they put Him back to the ocean.<br>

<font color="DarkGreen"><b>You are the One to be worshipped first. Obeisance to You again and again.<br>
You are the Word that was in the beginning. You are the Oṃkāra.<br>
You are the source of life. You are the source of security.</b></font>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Only thing, it is for you to respect it, to behave in a manner that you respect your innocence. Not to feel shy about your innocence, never. Your innocence itself is a power and your innocence will definitely give you that wisdom by which you can solve all the problems without any difficulty."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Establish Śhrī Gaṇeśha within you.</b> First of all, you must establish Him and then you can use it for others, for yourself, and for bettering and bettering the methods of Sahaja Yoga that you have learned.<br>
That’s how Śhrī Gaṇeśha is so important for all the Sahaja Yogis to be understood in all its aspects, but this principle is very enormous I should say. The principle is very spread out, it’s very subtle, so to understand in all its aspects is not an easy thing. The only thing you can do is to become One with it, like the Ocean. If you become One with the Ocean you become the Ocean. Just become One with it and that’s how it works out."</font><br>
