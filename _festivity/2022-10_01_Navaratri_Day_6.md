<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we have gathered here to do the Navarātri Pūjā.</b><br>
There were nine times when the Major Incarnations of the Mother of this Universe were manifested. They were manifested with a purpose. That purpose is to protect Her bhaktas, Her disciples, Her children.<br>
This was a binding love. She could not escape it. Mother’s Love is binding. She cannot escape it. And She has to manifest it, work it out, and give that protection to all Her children.
This protection in the modern times has taken another form.<br>
In those days, the evil was trying to harm, to destroy the people who were righteous, who were bhaktas, who were doing good things, who wanted to lead a very religious life. So to save them, She incarnated.<br>
To protect them, She incarnated. But they knew what was good, they knew what was wrong. And they wanted to preserve their good life, their precious life. They didn’t care for money, they didn’t care for power, but just they wanted their life, means they wanted to be alive to worship the Goddess. And when they were troubled or harmed or destroyed by these evil forces, She had to manifest."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So the Sages, Saints have made this arrangement that you worship the Devī. But the person who is not realized is not authorized to worship the Devī.<br>
......<br>
So, you have a special authority with you that you can do the Pūjā of the Devī and Sākṣhāt Devī. This is not so with everyone. If everyone tries to do it, it has the reverse effect; the wrong effect.<br>
Most important thing is, this Śhakti is so comforting, so nurturing, so generous, so loving, it is so complete. There is nothing in between. Either it is very generous or very angry. Nothing in between."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"Actually, nobody has right even to do a Havana unless and until he is not a realized Soul.<br>
All this Bhūr Bhuvaḥ Swāhā whatever is said is all the seven chakras.<br>
Nobody has the right to touch that fire because you cannot enlighten the fire.<br>
When you get Realization you will be surprised fire gets enlightened and you put your hands towards the fire you might get a black soot coming out of you. It’s all artificial."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Goddess used to give enlightenment and Goddess used to be alert for you.</b> She would sit like a tigress for Her children. They are praying, they are doing Pūjā, they are doing some sort of a Homa, Havana, so the Goddess would sit down, protect them from all negativity coming, all rākṣhasas coming, kill them, this, do that. But that stage is gone now. Now She's entered into you. So you have to kill your negativity, you've become as powerful as your Mother. No negativity can touch you. So you can give Realization, you've got that power very well; and you can watch your defects more than that of others. And you try to put them out because they're not good, they're not for your benevolence, they're not for your ascent."</font><br>
