<font color="DarkRed">"<b>While you can see that once the Ambā, this Kuṇḍalinī who is the reflection of the Holy Ghost, of the Ādi Śhakti within you, when She rises through these different chakras, She gives them power because She’s the Power, She’s the Śhakti. She is the Desire Power of Sadāśhiva. She is the Complete Power of Sadāśhiva.</b> And so She gives the power totally to every chakra, by which all these chakras are enlightened and all the Deities are awakened. Supposing we have no power of life, we’ll be like dead people. So these centers when they receive this Power, this Śhakti, then they are awakened. Now you have seen it, you can do it yourself. It’s all tangible, you can verify it. I have told you that She resides on the Heart center. Now see how Heart center is placed – also very interesting to see. While She is Jagadambā; but the Ambā, means the pure form of power, resides in the triangular bone, like Kuṇḍalinī. But Her form which is Jagadambā, where She is the Mother of the Universe, She resides on the Heart center."</font><br>

Bhaya kāya tayā Prabhu jyāchā re<br>
When belonging to God, what is there to fear?

The real treasure of wealth is inside yourself<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"The central path is the path of Lord Viṣhṇu. Through this path we attain the Śhiva Tattwa. So Śhiva Tattwa is the destination and the path is made by Lord Viṣhṇu. This central path is the creation of Lord Viṣhṇu and the Ādi Śhakti; Lord Śhiva has no role in it: He sits comfortably in His seat, without bothering for anybody; if someone wishes to come, may come. To attain Śhiv Tattwa we should go through this Viṣhṇu Path (Suṣhumṇā Path) and correct all the centers that are created on it. When the centers are cleansed, the Viṣhṇu path opens up and our ascent begins. Many a times I have told about all these centers. There is a center in Heart, which we call ‘left Heart’. This is not the center of the heart. In a way it is the reflection of Śhrī Mahādeva in the heart. <b>The abode of Śhiva is above our Minds and Thoughts.</b>"</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>We pray to Lord Śhiva to look after our Union. I surrender to You.</b> Now Gaurī Kuṇḍalinī surrenders to the Spirit. We pray to Lord Śhiva to look after this. I forget everything else. I leave it in Your holy hands. You raise me up. I forget all that was in me before, just lift me up. You raise me up. Everything I have dropped out, no other desire but just lift me higher. Make me Your servant. The rest of it is not important. All the other manifestations of this desire are over. Now I am absolutely surrendered to You, my Spirit. Lift me higher and higher and higher. Away from all the thoughts and things that were not the Spirit. Make me complete Spirit.<br>
Forget all that was there. That elevation, that ascent becomes fast quick trip.<br>
A very fast thing. If you just try this every moment, anything that goes against the Spirit must be given up. And that Spirit is what? The pure desire.<br>
We have to be one with the Spirit, and all the rest is not important. You are in the beautiful Kingdom of God where all ugliness drops out like when the lotus opens out; all the mud drops out from it.<br>
In the same beautiful way, let My children become fragrant beautiful offering to Lord Sadāśhiva.<br>
May God bless you."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"This soul is in the left Heart. Many people get confused about it. They think soul is in the Heart chakra, it is not in the chakra it is in the heart. The soul resides in this plain. Why does He not reside in the Heart chakra? Because it is on the path of Kuṇḍalinī to ascend. It is in the center [central Heart] and the soul resides in the left Heart."</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"So, if you have to place your attention to Sahasrāra, first thing you have to do is to pay attention to your heart.<br>
In the Sahasrāra, the Heart chakra and the heart itself, the Ātmā, coincide.<br>
<b>Means the Jagadambā becomes one with the heart, that is the Ātmā. So, we see that here the Yoga takes place.</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So, this center is the center of heart. Here the Jagadambā, the Mother of the Universe, resides. The One who is alone. She is alone. She ... She does not have any male Deity with Her. She is alone. She is the Mother. And She looks after the people who are struggling in this Ocean of Illusion. She is the One who is the protector. She incarnates. It’s said that She has incarnated thousand times, but She has incarnated many a times.<br>
Now, this Jagadambā is the One who resides there at that point. And when you are a child, say about twelve years of age, She creates the antibodies in the sternum bone. And these antibodies spread into the whole body and protect you from the outer problems. Now, those people who have the problem of this, specially in ladies, comes from insecurities in life."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So now we have the center, another center which is very important: is the center of Heart. <b>Center Heart we call it, is the center of the Mother of the Universe. In Sanskrit She is called as Jagadambā.</b> She is the One who stays there and gives you the sense of security. She looks after the Saints who are trying to get out of this green thing [Void around the Nābhī], we call it as the Ocean of Illusion: She protects them, She gives them all the help, all the guidance and tries to pull them out of the illusion/ And this is the way She kills all the devils and the demons who are like fake gurus trying to put down the seekers into the illusion more. <b>She’s the One who is the remover of illusion, and this incarnates again and again on this Earth to help the seekers to get out of the Ocean of Illusion.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"If you have sense of insecurity then these, these lungs start breathing fast. You have seen suddenly you, if you meet with fear you get that breathing very fast in you. And this breathing is denoting or is pointing out to some sort of a fear that is working within you. It could be due to previous conditionings or could be immediate, but this center starts working, breathing starts moving at a very high speed and that is the sign of this center that it starts emitting power of protection when if you start breathing heavily. But it is automatically done."</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"But today in Sahaja Yoga, you have seen that when Kuṇḍalinī rises and stops at the center Nābhī [Heart], you have to say the mantra of Jagadambā, and the Kuṇḍalinī rises.<br>
That means, She resides in the center Heart, and when She is being worshiped, the Kuṇḍalinī rises.<br>
This center has got twelve petals.<br>
But the Goddess has thousand hands and thousand eyes.<br> 
She has Sixteen Thousand Nāḍīs to work out Her different aspects of enlightenment.<br>
But the first thing She has to do, through Her generosity, and kindness, and compassion, and patience, She has to suck in the sins – the Pāpavimochinī.<br> 
The sins of human beings."</b></font><br>
