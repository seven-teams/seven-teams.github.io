<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we are going to do the Pūjā of Ādi Śhakti.</b><br>
It’s a difficult subject uuh to talk about Ādi Śhakti, because is not easy to understand that Ādi Śhakti is the Power of Sadāśhiva. Sadāśhiva is the God Almighty. She is His breath, as they some people call it.<br>
Some say She is the Desire and some say that She’s the Entire Power of Sadāśhiva and Sadāśhiva cannot do anything without Her Powers.<br>
..The first thing is, we must know, that She created a Kuṇḍalinī in the Mother Earth Itself and She created Śhrī Gaṇeśha out of the Mother Earth, it’s very interesting.<br>
So, the Mother Earth becomes a very important thing for us. If we do not know how to respect the Mother Earth, we do not know how to respect ourselves.<br>
The expression of Ādi Śhakti within you is the Kuṇḍalinī, no doubt. That is the reflection of Ādi Śhakti in you. But the reflection in the Mother Earth is also expressed, as you all know, in different places, different countries, different cities as the manifestation of chakras and Ādi Śhakti’s creations. It was very important first to create a very holy Mother Earth for human beings to be born on them [it]. So the reflection of the Ādi Śhakti as Kuṇḍalinī first was on the Mother Earth.<br>
Kuṇḍalinī is a, we should say, is a wee part of the Ādi Śhakti. Or we can say that She is the desire, pure desire of the Ādi Śhakti. So Ādi Śhakti is the desire, complete desire of Sadāśhiva, and Kuṇḍalinī, Ādi Kuṇḍalinī, is the desire, complete desire of Ādi Śhakti."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today, we are all going to worship Me, first time. It has been always the Pūjā of [an] aspect of Me or a part of Me.<br>
Now, one has to know very clearly what is Ādi Śhakti. As we say, is the Pure Desire of God Almighty, of Sadāśhiva. But what is the pure Desire of God Almighty?<br>
If you see your own desires, come out of what? Not out of the Divine Love but out of carnal love, out of material love, of out of power love. Behind all these desires there is love.<br>
......<br>
<b>So Ādi Śhakti is the Embodiment of God’s Divine Love, is God’s Pure Love, and in His Love what did He desire? He desired that He should create human beings, who would be very obedient, would be sublime, would be like angels.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>Somebody asked Me “Is it necessary to have this Pūjā.” I think if there is any Pūjā you should do, it is this one – is Ādi Śhakti.<br>
It is very important that this Pūjā must be performed,</b><br>
because that is how you grow, this reflection improves and you grow more and more within yourself,<br>
through the power of Ādi Śhakti or through the power of Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
As you know that Ādi Śhakti has her own Kuṇḍalinī, which is the Ādi Kuṇḍalinī, and the reflection of that within you – is the Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
So you have to worship and it’s the best way to please your own Kuṇḍalinī, your own Mother, who has given you this birth.</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So, in that reflection that you are Me, in that reflection that the Mother Earth is Me</b>, in that beautiful creation within you, you have to become very sensitive to the need of the world, what is the need of the world. Today, if you fail, the whole thing will fail forever. Only very few will be there. So the need for you is: to spread Sahaja Yoga because this love is not only for you. Is not to be enjoyed [only] by you, but is to be enjoyed by as many possible in the whole world.<br>
<b>So, today we have to decide that, as the children of Ādi Śhakti, we have to go all out, everywhere, every corner, we have to shout and we have to tell loudly what is the time in which we are living and what is the responsibility that you have to fulfill as Sahaja Yogis.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"And at this place meet the three chakras, and that is why Śhrī Mahākālī, Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī and Śhrī Mahāsaraswatī, all these three Powers meet.<br>
<b>As these three Powers meet, they form one Power, that is Śhrī Ādi Śhakti.<br>
That is why in Sahasrāra Śhrī Ādi Śhakti resides, but it is said so, that in Sahasrāra Ādi Śhakti exists in a form of Mahāmāyā – Śhrī Ādi Śhakti exists, but She is in the form of Mahāmāyā.</b><br>
That is why the result of all these three Powers was like this, that Śhrī Ādi Śhakti comes into this world in the form of Mahāmāyā,<br>
and She can penetrate the Sahasrāra of everyone.<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"...... in India people talked about Kuṇḍalinī since long ago, and [they know] that she is the Ādi Śhakti, reflected within us. Now understand that this <b>Ādi Śhakti is the Power of Love, of Pure Love, of Compassion. There is nothing else She has: only the Pure Love within Her heart. But this Pure Love is so powerful, is so powerful!
That is the Love She has given to this Mother Earth.</b> Because of that, this Mother Earth, [in spite of] the amount of sins we may commit – we may do anything – is pouring out Her Love through these beautiful things to all us. Now, we have also this beauty expressed in every way of Her Love, through the galaxies you see, the stars you see. Now, if you want to see it from a scientific way, then science means ... it has no love in it there’s no question of love. Even people talk of Yoga but they don’t talk of love and compassion.<br>
When there is no love and compassion, there cannot be any divine spark in that person. Everything is non completely submerged in this Divine Love. Everything that is created on this Earth, everything that is created in this universe, and universes, and universes, is all because of the Love of the Divine Mother."</font><br>
