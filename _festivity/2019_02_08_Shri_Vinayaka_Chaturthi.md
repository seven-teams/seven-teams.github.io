<font color="DarkRed"><b>"This is the importance of this day.<br>
Today if you ask for any wish, then Śhrī Gaṇeśha will fulfill it.<br> 
It is His right to fulfill all your desires, because you are all realized.<br>
Ask Him with all your heart and He will help you in every way, every moment, every instant."</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Today is a very important day for all of us Sahaja Yogis, because today Shrī Gaṇesha was born.</b> Shrī Gaṇesha is whom we worship and because of whom we got our realization. However much you may remember Him, until you do not know His special qualities, you cannot attain Him. His special quality is that He is the embodiment of purity (shuddha swarūp) and complete Master of the Universe. He is the incarnation of the Supreme, of Brahman.<br>
By coming into this world He has created music (sangeet), rhythm (tāl) and notes (sur). By His Grace only people become one with music (talleen)(engrossed). A small boy who came into the world and did such great work! He has given so many things to everyone and even today He is active. Shrī Gaṇesha’s Pūjā, no matter how much you do it, it is not enough. A lot of people say we don’t see Shrī Gaṇesha, even after worshipping Him so much, we do not attain Him."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Today is a very big day, because the actual Pure Spirit has taken birth today. And He already had such an eternal state, that many people could not comprehend it or write about it. They wrote only what they understood, but now that you are realized you can understand that by the Power of Śhrī Gaṇeśha’s name you can get your Realization. By taking His name alone any disease or any pain will disappear. He is eternal. He is always present within us, when you get your Realization, you can feel Him."</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"But in a deeper way, if you see who is Śhrī Gaṇeśha, He is the child of Ādi Śhakti.<br> 
She created Him from the Auṃkāra.<br> 
Now, Auṃkāra is the Logos, as you call it, is the first sound when Sadāśhiva and Ādi Śhakti separated, for creation.<br> 
That sound is used as Auṃkāra which are vibrations, which have light in it."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>But when Pārvatī made Śhrī Gaṇeśha, He was the Son of Pārvatī alone.</b> There was no Father. Pārvatī Herself wanted to have a child of Her own. There were angels who were dedicated either to Viṣhṇu or to Śhiva, like gaṇas were dedicated to Śhiva alone. So, She wanted to have Her own Son who can permeate Her Powers on this Earth.<br>
So to begin with when the Śhakti created this universe and Sadāśhiva was watching Her creation, the first thing She created on this Earth was innocence and the Embodiment of that Innocence was Śhrī Gaṇeśha."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Śhrī Gaṇeśha was made out of the, they say, it is a beautiful poetic way of saying it, out of the mud that was covering the Mother Pārvatī</b> or you can say the Gaurī at that time. Because she was not married in the sense that she was a virgin just finished her marriage and she was to meet her husband and this virgin wanted to have a bath before meeting her husband, so she cleanses her hands properly and makes this Deity of Śhrī Gaṇeśha which is bestowed on this center. If you really develop your proper insight through meditation you can see Śhrī Gaṇeśha settled down there very clearly.<br>
Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the Embodiment of Innocence and that’s why He is a child, that’s why His head is that of an elephant, because an elephant being an animal doesn’t grow into ego and superego like human beings do. That’s why He is a child. He is the Embodiment of Childhood and He incarnated on this Earth once which is described in Devī Bhāgavat[am] if you read as Mahāviṣhṇu."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>You cannot feel joyous until you worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha.</b> By worshiping Śhrī Gaṇeśha, your joy increases, you become joyous, because He is the personification of joy (Ānand Swarūp). Because of this, both things are today, His birthday and His help. We take His help in any work what we do. Such is our way. But we don’t see what we have to do to awaken Him."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So I have to make a very simple announcement today</b>, that on this day of Śhrī Gaṇeśh, all My children who are born like Śhrī Gaṇeśha, in the same pattern, should become dynamic like Him, innocent like Him, great like Him, working twenty-four hours. This little Child is working throughout the day and night to give you this Source of Joy."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">Now there is a thing called Saṅkalp.<br>
Means that you have now say, why do you want to do the Pūjā of Śhrī Gaṇeśha. It’s called Saṅkalp. At this time you have to say this, that, 
<b>‘I do worshiping Śhrī Gaṇeśha for developing Sahaja Yoga and for working out Sahaja Yoga within myself, with all my friends, with all my relations, with all my country men, with all the world.’</b><br>
It’s like that.</font><br>
