<font color="DarkRed">"The right one is the Mahāsaraswatī Power. This one gives you the right sympathetic nervous system.<br>
The central one is the Suṣhumṇā. This is the path of our evolution. Throughout we have evolved through this path of the Suṣhumṇā, where you ascend up to the Sahasrāra, and when you cross that, then you become a realized Soul. This is called as the Mahālakṣhmī's Power.<br>
Mahākālī, Mahāsaraswatī and Mahālakṣhmī, and three of Them put together in the brain, then become the Ādi Śhakti, the Primordial Mother. And that also we call it as the Ādi Śhakti's Seat, that is above your head."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we have the idea to do Saraswatī’s Pūjā.</b> ...... I have seen that here people worship Mahākālī and Saraswatī, people worship Devī and people are simple natured. We should worship Saraswatī as well. Saraswatī’s work is very great.<br>
First, Mahāsaraswatī created the entire universe. The earth element is special in this. The earth element has been placed in such a way between the Sun and the Moon that any living work can easily happen on it. From this living work, slowly and gradually human beings have been generated. But we should know our own great power. That power is what we call creation power, it’s also called creativity.<br>
This creation power is the blessing of Saraswatī by which many arts have been generated. The evolution of art is due to the blessings of Saraswatī."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"The second power, which He gave us, which He sent to us, was Mahāsaraswatī and to this Mahāsaraswatī Power, 
<b>He called Counselor, the one who will counsel you – that means, who helps us for Yoganirūpaṇ [to see the form of Yoga].</b> 
With the help of this second power, we will get Gyān [Knowledge], we will know the subtle knowledge."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Śhāradā, the Goddess of Saraswatī</b> is the One who carries the message of Virāṭa within and tells us how to sing. She tells us what is appealing to God. How these rāgas were made also? Just think of it. Because first they chose the notes, the āroha [crescendo] and avarohas [decrescendos], the going up and down [ascending melody and descending melody], which was appealing to God. So the melodies were created. Melodies are fixed. You cannot change the melodies the notes because they found out that, at this point, the Spirit awakened; on the vibrations they found out. They found out that, when they sang this way it worked out. The vīṇā [Primordial Instrument of Śhrī Saraswatī] they played and they found out the exact swaras. Exact swaras which would really make you feel nice. Now, you know that, those people have come from the West, don't understand any Indian music on the mental level but they understand at the spiritual level because their Spirits get filled with joy and the vibrations starts flowing."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"There’s another power <b>She has is Vāk Śhakti, by which you give speech. She’s the One Who gives you the Power to Speak.</b> She’s the One Who gives you the power to communicate, by speech, by your writings, by all the drama or plays you have or films you have – any kind of communications that are done through the Power of Saraswatī has that intellect behind it, and that intellect comes from Her Power.<br>
So even Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa has to use Her Power. Everybody has to use Her Power, because if you don’t use the Saraswatī’s Power, then only Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa’s one Power is that He is a diplomat and that diplomacy comes from the Power of the Saraswatī."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So one must learn how to respect the books, specially the Scriptures.<br>
<b>And She’s the One Who gives you the penetration power into these books, 
to know what is the truth and what is not</b> – penetration power to understand what is written between the lines, what is the subtle meaning of the whole thing – <b>that is the Power of Saraswatī.</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Only the Sahaja Yogis, those who are enlightened people, can worship Mahāsaraswatī. Otherwise, people can only worship Saraswatī because with worship of Saraswatī you can read books, you can create dances, music, for the amusement of human beings, but actually the Saraswatī Pūjā is meant for people of ordinary awareness, means ordinary or normal human awareness. But for Sahaja Yogis, it is the Mahāsaraswatī which is to be worshiped."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"And She is a person of humility, so the person who is a learned has to be humble. If he is not humble, then he’s not learned according to the Principle of Saraswatī. She has – the person who is very much learned has to bow down with the fruits of his learnings, so that a person who is learned and thinks no end of himself is a person who has not yet learned fully, is a half-baked person and that’s why an egoist cannot be a learned man. Learned man is always extremely humble. That is the sign, because <b>She is the Power which gives you humility, not humility of a businessman but a genuine humility She gives you.</b>"</font><br>
