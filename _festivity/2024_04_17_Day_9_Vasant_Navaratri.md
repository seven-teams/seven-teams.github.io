<font color="DarkRed">"<b>We have gathered here on the occasion of Rām Navamī.</b> Everybody has said, "Mother please tell us about Śhrī Rām."<br>
You know that Śhrī Rāma has a very important place on our chakra, He is situated on our right Heart. Śhrī Rāma has taken the place of father, hence if there is lack in the responsibility or love from father this chakra is caught.<br>
In Sahaja Yoga we too understand that Śhrī Rāma and all other Deities have taken the form to fulfill Their divine work, in all Śhrī Rāma had a special task. As it was said by Socrates that the Benevolent King has to come the same way Śhrī Rāma had come on this Earth as benevolent king, He came in the form of human being, He even forgot that He was Incarnation of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, forgot about Him but for all world He was Puruṣhottama Rāma.<br>
In Sahaja Yoga we need to know when we pray any Deity, we have imbibed the specialties and qualities of the particular Deity within us, Śhrī Rāma had many qualities.<br>
You all know his childhood life and you have already heard about his qualities, he was Puruṣhottama he had another quality that in his ruling, he did not care for his wife or children's in front of his subjects view."</font><br>

<font color="Indigo">"Śhrī Rāma was born at midnight so let's have Pūjā late. Śhrī Rāma Pūjā is not a specially long one. As He is in a human form He is humanity within us by which we understand our intellect and our thoughts get changed. Śhrī Rāma is that through Him we can change our thoughts. Our nature can change because He is our ideal.<br>
After achieving His ideals, we reach another because He was human ideal.<br>
<b>It is great that God came to this world in a human form to became our ideal. He has gone through all the hardships to show us strength to keep dharma. That is Viśhwa Dharma and the State of Yoga.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"Śhrī Rāma Himself was born on the right side. Great example for all of you is Śhrī Rām who was on the right side, who works the right side. When He was born and He was a child ... <b>He is a Sūryavaṃśhi, He is the son of Sūrya, I mean, Sūrya's everything comes from the Sun to Him.</b> When He was born and was a little child, He asked His mother that, ``I would like have uh like to have the Moon." The [He] started crying, and nobody knew how to satisfy. He said, ``I want to have the Moon." They gave Him any toys, He threw away. Said, ``What a child it is‽ Funny thing! He wants to have the Moon, now how to get Him the moon?" They did not know how to solve the problem. He said, ``Somehow you get Me the Moon. I don't want to eat or anything, I want to have the Moon." Here the Moon represents the Ātmā, the cooling [smiling:] capacity. He asked for the Moon.<br>
You are all on the right side, so ask for the Moon. Ask for the Spirit.<br>
And they didn't know how to satisfy this Śhrī Rāma, who was the [laughing:] Incarnation of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, [laughing:] asking for the Moon of all the things, not for anything else. What's so important? So, the mother has always a[n] intuition. She brought a -- it's a, it's a māyā, it's a beautiful drama -- she brought a mirror and showed Him the Moon in the mirror. He [she] said, ``Now, you can get the Moon here." [Laughter, laughs.] So sweet! And He was satisfied! Even the reflection of that can satisfy.<br>
You are like the mirrors and I want to see the reflection of Moon [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] in you. "</font><br>

<font color="Indigo">"Today I said that Śhrī Rāma was born at twelve o'clock hence the Pūjā should be at time as such it is not long Pūjā but we have to understand that the human form within us in form of humanity in which we understand and make changes in our mind, curiosity and thoughts.<br>
Through the medium of Śhrī Rāma can bring change in our thoughts, he can bring change in our behavior because he is ideal for us, reaching this ideal we can reach other ideals since he is ideal of human being.<br>
This is big thing that the God Himself came on this Earth and become ideal.<br>

Like He was, He married the Lakṣhmī Principle, that was Sītā, and then also He lived a normal married life, when He gave Her up, He lived like an ascetic, to show how a man should lead his life in a proper dharma, as a married man. And even when the Wife has gone away, how He was leading a life of complete chastity."</font><br>

<font color="Indigo">"<b>On the night of Full Moon, you should meditate on Śhrī Rāma and surrender yourself to Him for protection. The meaning of the word rāmachandra is `creativity'. You should completely dedicate your creative powers to Him.</b> Thus you have to take special care of yourself on these two days.<br>
However, <b>on the seventh (Saptamī) and ninth (Navamī) days of Lunar fortnights you have My special blessings. Remember that you are specially blessed by Me on these two days.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Śhrī Rāma came on this Earth to establish the institution of benevolent king.</b> The political development and the political evolution started from this [right] side. <b>He is the one who gave leadership as a benevolent king, the one who represents God and who is a king. The idea of a king related to God came from Śhrī Rāma.</b><br> 
But the modern kings are not like that, they have no relation with God. On the contrary, they are horrid people. Some of them are nothing but satanic people, absolutely Satan is there and you can see from the way they lead their lives, and they have led their life before. So the benevolence of Śhrī Rāma is here [shows the right Heart] to be followed by all the political leaders and all the people who are at the helm of affairs. He is the ideal that was created for human beings, to run their authority as the head, or the loving compassionate benevolent leader of the people, who has to govern them by making them respectful, by respect. And if human beings create such things who are not respectable, those who have no human values, those who have no moral courage, those who are selfish, those who are self-centered, then they have nothing to do to be there.<br>
<b>So this is the position of Rāma who is the Father. So the head of every state has to be the father of his subjects, that's what He has tried to show by His life. So much so that He had to sacrifice His beloved Wife, whom He loved so much.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"That is a very beautiful song was written by him. But still, the description of a child, how when he runs when he runs, when he jumps, when he walks it's a beautiful songs about Śhrī Rāma. Ṭhumko atta hai who -- Ṭhumaka chalat Rām[a]chandra, atta hai kya?<br>
[In Hindi:] <b>Do you know the song `Ṭhumaka chalat Rām[a]chandra' ...?</b><br>
[In English:] Now these words are such that we cannot explain in English, but when they walk, you know, with -- started walking, so their body, you know, moves in a way that's called `ṭhumakanā' [toddle, waddle] in Hindi language. <b>So described by Tulasīdāsa, as Śhrī Rāma is walking in that way. `Ṭhumaka chalat Rām[a]chandra'.
