<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we are celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ.</b><br>
The birth of Jesus Christ is very symbolic because He was born in such a manner that even the poorest of poor won’t be born  in the stable. And He was put in the bed which was made of dried grass.<br>
He came on this Earth to show people that for a person who is an Incarnation or who is a highly evolved soul, is not bothered about the comfort of the body. His Message was so great and so deep, but He had disciples who were not prepared for the battle they had to fight. Is the same thing that sometimes happens with Sahaja Yoga. He had only 12 disciples, we too have 12 types of Sahaja Yogis, and all of them, though [they] try to dedicate themselves to Christ, fell a trap, some of them, to the worldly aspirations or to their own hankerings.<br>
<b>His Message of Love and Forgiveness is the same even today. Preached by all, all the Saints, all the Incarnations, all the Prophets. They all have said about Love and Forgiveness.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen"><b>You have compassion for those who love You,<br>
and it is for those who love You that You come to this Earth.<br> 
You are the force that creates, the energy that pervades<br>
and the Spirit that protects.<br>
Those who seek union with God pray through You;<br>
those who seek union with God worship You</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today, long time back, Christ was born. You all know the story of His birth, and of all the sufferings He had to go through.<br>
He’s the One who has given us a model of a Sahaja Yoga. For He didn’t live for Himself, in no way, but He lived for others, working out the Āgñyā chakra.<br>
You may be divine, you may be very powerful, but this world is so cruel that they don’t understand spirituality, they don’t understand the spiritual greatness. Not only that but there are many factors which attack spirituality, they have always done it.<br>
Every Saint has suffered a lot, but I think Christ has suffered the most.<br>
As you know, He was endowed with all the Powers of Śhrī Gaṇeśh, as He is the Reincarnation of Śhrī Gaṇeśha.<br>
The first of them was His innocence: He was the eternal child, we should say that He could not understand the cruelty and the hypocrisy of this stupid world. Still, if you can understand, what can you do about it? But with great courage, He took birth in a country where people had no idea of spirituality."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So, they say 'Merry Christmas' is enjoyment for joy. Out of peace comes the joy, the light of joy, the happiness.</b><br>
I wish peace for the whole world, for the whole nation, to understand to give up all the strives, all the false battles, for money and for power, all wrong ideas that they are different from each other, and come under the banner of Sahaja Yoga and enter into the Kingdom of God, where they are invited with all respect and love.<br>
I wish peace to all of them, to all the countries, all the human beings: in their families, in their hearts, with their children, with all of them. Let there be peace, let their heart emit peace, their tongues speak with peace, their eyes see nothing but peace.<br>
All this has to change, tremendous change has to take place.<br>
...... <b>I bless all of you to be the channels of that peace, to be beautiful channels of that peace, to be glorious channels of that peace, to be great children of your Mother, who is so proud of you.<br>
May God bless you.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Now I would tell you this, that if Christ is born and He came on this Earth, it’s a very, very great occasion. He gave His life for us, He did everything. And how are we following Him is by forgiving. <b>You have to forgive others, you forgive yourself and you forgive others. Is very important if you want to open this Āgñyā chakra, where resides our Lord Jesus Christ.</b><br>
If you cannot forgive others and you cannot forgive yourself, then this Āgñyā won’t open. And the best part of it, all the Christian nations I have seen, where there are so-called Christians, they all have a very bad Āgñyā. If they are really following Christ, why should there be a catch on the Āgñyā chakra?<br>
And they are extremely dominating, arrogant people. They cannot be the disciples of Christ. He was so humble, He was so much one with God Almighty, that He accepted His crucifixion. His birth itself is a very great miracle, and His work is even greater."</font><br>

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image868.png" /></div>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>He came to teach us humility.</b><br> 
The word teaching in English language means telling about it, talking about it.<br>
But when I say ‘teach’, I mean create, you activate within us humility.<br>
Actually He came on this Earth, first of all, to create a space within us, at the Āgñyā chakra, by removing the hurdles of the ego, hurdles of the ego.<br>
He had to talk of humility that time because Romans were ruling and they were very arrogant: were very crude, uncouth, underdeveloped, we should say, not at all evolved."</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"It was a living example of a very Great Advent that He came on this Earth and led such a pure and a holy life.<br>
<b>Try to develop your purity and holiness, and a powerful holiness and a powerful auspiciousness, which does not get contaminated, but fights whatever is anti-God, whatever is anti-Christ.</b><br>
So today is a day when you are celebrating His birthday again. And on this day, let Him be born within us! Let Him be born in our character, in our behavior, in our temperament.<br>
He was a detached man, not attached to material things, nothing of the kind."</font><br>

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image869.png" /></div>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"So we have to learn a lot from the great life of Christ, who was born as a very humble man, and He did such great things.<br>
He tried to improve our Āgñyās, and even now, if you think of Him, your Āgñyā will be all right. It will be finished.<br>
I know among Sahaja Yogis also there are people who are very pushing, who are all the time pushing themselves.<br> 
For what? What do you want? All the time they are pushing around. Just like all other stupid people.<br>
So to feel the satisfaction within yourself, just like Christ, you have to meditate and introspect, and find out, ‘Are you, satisfied people?’<br>
You have to be very much satisfied in life, otherwise, no use having Sahaja Yoga. No use getting your Self-realization.<br>
<b>I bless you from My heart, that you take the character of Christ as a model for you, and to understand the problems of the world, from the whole world, as your own problems.<br>
May God bless you.</b>"</font><br>
