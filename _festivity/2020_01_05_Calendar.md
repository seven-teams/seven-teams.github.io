This year there's a special feature of the calendar where Puja dates are not listed directly in calendar but at the last page where we have preliminary puja date list & stickers. The reason is that sometimes Puja dates change or sometimes it's internationally on Sunday but locally on Saturday. See the below link to download the Stickers for Calendar.<br>
