<font color="DarkRed">"Jesus Christ possesses all Powers of Ekādeśha Rudras, that is Eleven Powers of destruction. These powers have their centers located around the cranium of our head. When the Incarnation of Kalki takes place, all these Eleven Powers perform the work of destruction. Out of these Eleven Powers one is that of Śhrī Hanumāna, the other of Śhrī Bhairava. In the Bible, these two powers are named as Saint Gabriel and Saint Michael respectively. After Self-realization in Sahaja Yoga one can awaken these Powers by addressing them in Sanskrit, Marathi or even in English. The nāḍī on our right side, which is known as ‘Piṅgalā nāḍī’, is activated by the Power of Śhrī Hanumāna. Whenever, any sort of pressure or constriction develops inside this nāḍī, it is instantly relieved by Chanting the mantra of Śhrī Hanumāna. Similarly, even by chanting the name of Saint Michael one would experience relief in the Iḍā nāḍī. Iḍā nāḍī is on our left side and manifests the Power of Saint Michael or Śhrī Bhairava."</font><br>

<b>I sing praise of Kalabhairav, Who is the ruler of the city Kashi, Who is the maintainer of righteousness, Who is the destroyer of unrighteous paths, Who liberates us from the ties of karma or deeds, Who bestows us with shyness, Who is splendid, and Whose organ-groups are decorated with a beautiful cord of golden color.</b><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today we have gathered here to do Pūjā to Bhairavanāth. I think we have not understood the significance of Bhairavanāth who runs up and down on the Iḍā nāḍī. Iḍā nāḍī is the nāḍī of Chandramā, is of the Moon. So this is a channel for us to cool down. So the work of Bhairavanāthjī is to cool us down.<br>
For example, people have a hot temper with their ego, with their liver, whatever it is, and if a person is in a big temper, then Bhairavanāth plays tricks on that person to cool him down. He organizes everything under his own control with [the] gaṇas’ help, with Gaṇapati’s help, to cool down your temperament, to give you a balance."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"There are other styles of personalities like Chirañjīvas, and we have got Hanumāna. These are all Incarnations. Bhairava, Gaṇeśha. Hanumāna is nobody else, but later on, he appeared as ‘Gabriel the Angel’. And Bhairavnāth came as Saint Michael. The names are different, but they are the same people. These are the Chirañjīvas Incarnations."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So today I am very happy that we are worshiping Śhrī Bhairava because he is very much connected with Gaṇeśha. As you know, Śhrī Gaṇeśha is at the Mūlādhāra while Bhairava moves onto the left side and goes to the right side. So all kinds of conditionings, all kinds of habits, can be conquered through the help of Bhairavanāth.<br>
......<br>
He protects us also, from doing wrong things, sly things like thieving. Whatever we think we can do secretly, can be hidden, but you cannot hide it from Bhairavanāth.<br>
If you don’t change then he exposes you completely. That’s how he has exposed all the horrible false gurus.<br>
So today we are here to worship this great Deity of Bhairavanāth who incarnated on this Earth later on, ultimately as Mahāvīra also.<br>
So he stands on the gate of hell and stops people from falling into hell. But if you want to go to hell, if it is your desire, is your willpower like that working – that I should go to hell – then he says: “All right, you can go."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Ekādeśha Rudra are all the powers, I would say, of destruction, together. Is the power, Destructive Power of Śhrī Gaṇeśha. It is Destructive Power of Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, Maheśha. It is the Destructive Power of the Mother. Is the Destructive Power of the Gaṇeśha ... and four of these are Bhairava and Hanumāna, Kārttikeya and Gaṇeśha. Also the Powers of Sadāśhiva and of the Ādi Śhakti. All the Destructive Powers of all the Incarnations are Ekādeśha’s."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So what is it, that Bhairava is to be established. “Siddha kālā mane Bhairav” – as you have to establish Śhrī Gaṇeśha, you have to establish also Bhairava, and Hanumāna on the right side. If these three Deities you establish within yourself, nothing, nothing on this Earth can catch you."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"I, of course, bless you, with all the qualities of Bhairava, 
as He is the greatest disciple of Mahākālī and 
He is the One who is running up and down, morning till evening every time, 
especially in the night He is working so very hard killing these horrible rākṣhasas, this,
that, and achieving such results.<br>
We have to join Him, all of us, and work it out.<br>
May God bless you."</font><br>
