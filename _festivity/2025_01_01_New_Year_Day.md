<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now, we are starting a New Year, and I wish you all a very happy and prosperous New Year.</b> [Applause.]<br>
In this wish of Mine I also wish you a very deep growth in Sahaja Yoga. [Applause.]<br>
Now, you all are Sahaja Yogis. And you all have to become masters in Sahaja Yoga. For becoming masters in Sahaja Yoga, I'm sure you are doing meditation, introspection, and all kinds of Sahaja Yoga rituals, I should say.<br>
In this New Year, I'll think there is greater chance for you to do much better, because all those years of ordeals are over."</font><br>

"Today I was thinking that uh <b>we'll do the Pūjā to Mahālakṣhmī, would be better, so that we'll understand what is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma is</b>."<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Now the Sahaja Yogis have to decide how far they will spread Sahaja Yoga all over. How many people can get into Sahaja Yoga? There should be many more waiting for you this year, and maybe this year, if you all decide to work it out, I am sure you can get lots of people who will be saved from the curses of Kali Yuga. <b>This is going to be your vow on the New Year day, that, 'Now we are going to start Sahaja Yoga in a new way, in a bigger way, in a more dynamic way.'<br>
For that, first thing is needed is your Saṅgha Śhakti, that is your collectivity. This collectivity has to be extremely well built in, well made, well understood and absolutely lovable.</b><br>
This is not difficult in Sahaja Yoga, because practically all your jealousies, all your baser ideas have been completely washed out by your Kuṇḍalinī. She has transformed you, you are different people. You are very, very different. Not only that, but you have now understood your Selves. You are knowing your Self.<br>
And all those who know their Self cannot fight with each other. Because <b>this Self is the reflection of One Person, of One Deity, of One God. And so how can you fight? When He is within your heart, how can you fight with each other? Otherwise you'll be fighting with yourself. It would be very, very stupid to do that. So all the fights and all the funny things that you have been thinking about will of course disappear, no doubt.</b><br>
But you'll become very dynamic. You'll be amazed at your dynamism. Just you have to rise; just you have to expect your Self to manifest."</font><br>

"<b>Today is a great day when we are celebrating Mahālakṣhmī's Pūjā.</b><br>
You must be knowing that today is the day of Mary, Mother of Christ, who was Mahālakṣhmī.<br>
<b>Mahālakṣhmī's Incarnation is very important for Sahaja Yoga.<br>
First, She establishes our dharma, by which we become righteous, we become religious in the real sense.</b> After the light of Realization we cannot do anything that is not dharma.<br>
As you know what is dharma is, and the maryādās, the boundaries of our behavior.<br>
This transformation takes place automatically. I don't have to tell you, 'Don't do this, don't do this,' like Ten Commandments. You, yourself, establish your dharma, and you enjoy your virtues.<br>
This happens, as you know already has happened to all of you, with the Grace of Mahālakṣhmī.<br>
Then She starts bestowing blessings on you."<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today, again, is a New Year's Day.<br>
Uh every new year comes because we have to take to something that is new. It has been so arranged that the Sun has to move for three hundred and sixty-five [365] days and again a new year has to come.<br>
Actually the whole solar system is moving in a spiral way. So, there is definitely a higher, higher state, of this solar system. Every year it is rising higher in a spiral way. So it is not only that: it is because three hundred and sixty-five [365] days have passed because it has moved a step forward, higher than whuh ... what it was.<br>
Now, we can see that in awareness, human beings have definitely risen much higher than what they were, say, about two thousand years back.<br>
But the first system that started, the whole universe was the first model, one can say, was created."</font><br>

"And that model has to be perfect. And that was a perfect model, which then started perfecting the rest of it. So that is the perfect model which is in the Principle of this Ascent, and that is working out this ascent.<br>
Now, the perfection of the rest of the universe takes place in various directions. But today we have to consider the Mahālakṣhmī Principle.<br>
<b>Now Mahālakṣhmī, as I told you, is a perfect principle. Is a perfect principle, it's perfect in it. It's born as perfect, will remain as perfect, will be always eternally perfect. So, that is not necessary to be corrected.</b>"<br>

<b>"<b>Today is the auspicious occasion of the New Year and auspicious blessings to you all.</b><br>
Every year a new year comes and keeps coming. But people do not understand the feeling of creating a new year. They only understand that on the New Year Day they will wear new clothes and celebrate. They never think that a new year is coming and what new thing we must think of. Whatever has been going on, it goes on day after day.<br>
<b>In Sahaja Yoga when we are so collective, then we must think what new thing we must have in Sahaja Yoga. You have gone quite deep in meditation. You understand meditation and you have also established a certain state.</b> But in a new year what new aspect you should take, we must put out attention towards this. <b>We must think what are the problems of our country and also the problems of the world, and how can we solve them. For this I think wherever a Sahaja Yogi has interest he should put attention on that.</b>"<br>
