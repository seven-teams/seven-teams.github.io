Śhrī Gaṇeśha Pūjā is most essential. Because of Śhrī Gaṇeśha only there is holiness spread in the whole world.</b><br>
Today, whatever problems we are seeing is because you have not yet recognized our greatness. And we do not know why we have not recognized its importance. And we do not know as to why we have come in this world and what work we are doing and what we have to do.<br>
In order to understand this, today, Sahaja Yoga has come to this world."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the embodiment of the existing reality of Paramachaitanya, or Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the manifestation of the invisible Paramachaitanya. And He establishes this perception on every chakra. Unless and until nirmalatā [immaculacy] exists in every chakra, only holiness shines from every chakra, rising of the Kuṇḍalinī is highly improbable. Even if She rises, She keeps falling each time. <b>The relationship between Kuṇḍalinī and Śhrī Gaṇeśha is that of Mother and Child."</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"People are not able to understand how to recognize Śhrī Gaṇeśha. ‘What should be there in their life?’ But this is very difficult. However, much you explain, whatever you say, humans do not understand how they can accept Śhrī Gaṇeśha. If on one side they are blessed by Śhrī Gaṇeśha and are nourished, then they are very pure. They reflect. That is not the point. If you are a very honest person it is all right. But if you fall short in naitikatā [morality], then it is wrong.<br>
If you are not able to put your attention on the problems faced by the world, then also you lack balance.<br>
And if you want to awaken the powers of Śhrī Gaṇeśha within you, this is possible only through awakening of the Kuṇḍalinī. There is no other way."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen"><b>"But Śhrī Gaṇeśha’s greatest contribution to Sahaja Yoga is that He makes you feel My vibrations.</b><br> 
He makes you feel the beauty of purity and simplicity. [It’s] only possible if Śhrī Gaṇeśha is awakened within you.<br>
Also, the Kuṇḍalinī won’t rise without the sanction of this Chancellor. He’s the one sitting on Mūlādhāra.<br>
But you should know He is on every chakra.<br>
Innocence cures all the maladies: physical, mental, emotional, specially the spiritual one.<br>
But <b>Śhrī Gaṇeśha’s quality is the most important is: that He believes in emitting vibration[s], He believes in projecting His vibrations to everyone.<br>
That is the quality now I feel all of you, as Sahaja Yogis, can use.</b><br>
You got your Realization without any effort, I should say. It was sahaj."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today is the happiest day for all of you, for the whole universe, because Śhrī Gaṇeśha was created. He was created to emit auspiciousness through His Chaitanya. First, the whole cosmos was filled with this Chaitanyasṛiṣhṭi [Creation of Divine Vibrations]. Then Brahmadeva came into play, and He created all the matter. But the greatest blessings of the Divine Power was to symbolize Chaitanya, and this Chaitanya has many aspects, but specially in Śhrī Gaṇeśha, it is auspiciousness. In these modern times, people have lost the sense of auspiciousness. Everything that emits vibrations, ‘Chaitanya’, is auspicious, is śhubh, and whatever does not, is not, by any chance, auspicious. So, first of all, whatever you worship, whatever you accept, all of them have to be auspicious things"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So now, as you are created in the same image of Śhrī Gaṇeśh, you have to understand that you have to accept whatever God has given you, whatever position He has given you.<br>
......<br>
So, for a Sahaja Yogi first thing is to be self-contented.<br>
As I told you, the fundamentals of the Western life is to see and to be seen. Both things were missing completely in the Incarnation of Śhrī Gaṇeśh. So when I say these things, suddenly people start thinking, 'Let us become hippies, or let us become punks, or let us become this, let us become that.' You don't have to become anything. Whatever you have -- your body, your face, your hair -- everything is there, just meant for you. You don't have to change anything outwardly because inside is complete Chaitanya."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>So the priorities have to change if Śhrī Gaṇeśha is to be worshipped.<br>
What are we worshipping today is the innocence within us.</b><br> 
We are worshipping that is auspicious, which is innocent. 
Innocence, which is deep down within us - that's our character, that's our nature, that's what we are born with - is the basic of this whole Creation, is the essence of this Creation."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Innocence is the sustainance [sustenance], is the basis of spirituality. If a person doesn’t have innocence, we [he] cannot rise in spirituality.<br>
That’s why <b>the first job of Sahaja Yoga is to establish Śhrī Gaṇeśha within you, to awaken Him. As soon as the Kuṇḍalinī awakens, you must know that Śhrī Gaṇeśha comes into being.</b> Without His awakening within you, Kuṇḍalinī cannot be raised. But it could be temporary, or it could be a permanent thing.<br>
It could be very temporary with people who are not yet adjusted to the new method or to the Ways of God’s Love. Those who have not understood, or those who have not gone through those traditions, is rather difficult for them to establish Śhrī Gaṇeśha within them."</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>The greatest quality of Śhrī Gaṇeśha is joy.</b> It gives you joy, as small children, they may not speak even, but they give us so much joy. Joy-giving quality comes from Śhrī Gaṇeśha. Even after coming to Sahaja Yoga, I’ve seen people are not full of joy. Are very serious, they don’t know how to laugh, how to enjoy anything. That’s the sign that they are still lacking in innocence. So it’s important to understand that, if you are Sahaja Yogis, you should be joyous and give joy to others, just like children, how sweet they are. They may be newly born, but how much joy they give you. But supposing you do not have that capacity to enjoy the innocence of children, then nobody can help you. Gaṇeśha cannot help you. Because that’s the innate quality human beings have and if you don’t have that quality, no use having any other sense. Like some people like food, they like colors, they like all other things. But if you don’t have Śhrī Gaṇeśh you cannot purely enjoy anything.<br>
So it is only [with] Śhrī Gaṇeśha’s blessings that we really enjoy everything in its full measure."</font><br>

<b>Sahaja Yogis</b> [recite]: "Jay Gaṇeśha, Jay Gaṇeśha, Jay Gaṇeśha Pāhimām, Śhrī Gaṇeśha, Jay Gaṇeśha, Jaya Gaṇeśha Rakṣhamām."<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī</b></font>: <font color="DarkGreen">Now, what you are doing by saying these mantras, you are awakening the innocence within you; innocence is represented by Śhrī Gaṇeśh.<br>
As you know, later on, He incarnated as Lord Jesus Christ, but the innocence within us must be first of all invoked, because, before creating the universe, first of all, innocence was created, because innocence has the greatest protective power, the greatest destructive power and it is the most powerful.<br>
So, first, we are trying to invoke the innocence.<br> 
<b>Now, My Feet here represent Gaṇeśha, and they are innocent, and so, we are trying to worship those so that, within you, Gaṇeśha should be invoked.</b><br>
Your innocence should be enlightened, all right?</font><br>
