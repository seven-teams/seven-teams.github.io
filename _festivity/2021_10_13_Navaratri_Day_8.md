<font color="DarkRed">"Within us, God has placed Three Powers which in Sanskrit language they have named sort in English language I am sort. ...... on the left-hand side is the power within us which gives us our existence astitwa. This is the power for your information is of Mahākālī. This Mahākālī Power gives us the existence and our emotional life our desire because it is the Desire of God. Then the second line on the right-hand side as you see is the power of creativity. Is the power within us which is given to us by God which is called as Mahāsaraswatī Power. This is also within us. These two powers are very clearly seen that we desire. Whatever we desire we create.<br>
<b>These two powers within us are filled, coordinated, looked after, supported by the central power which we call as the Power of Mahālakṣhmī. Also, this power gives us our nature as a human being. Is the evolutionary power. And on this power only, by the Grace of this power only the God incarnates. His evolutionary power incarnates.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"All the Devatās and Gods are in their own position with their own qualities, they are there.<br>
Nowhere, <b>none of these Gods are described that they give you Mokṣha, except for the Goddess.<br>
She’s the only one who gives you Realization because She’s in charge of all the seven chakras.</b><br>
She holds all these seven chakras, and on these seven chakras She can work it out."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Sahaja Yoga is more concerned with the Mahālakṣhmī Power – evolutionary power – which also integrates all the Three Powers at the point beyond the Brahmarandhra (top of the head).</b> With this integration, the Sahaja Yoga discovery proves that the human being is a perfected instrument, a computer built in various period which, when put to the mains, starts giving information.<br>
It proves that all religions are living flowers on the tree of life and they describe the Truth. All Incarnations are “true”. All this can be proven at the time of Kuṇḍalinī awakening.<br>
It creates a human awareness, which can have a dialogue with the Unconscious."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is the eighth day of Navarātri, but it is great day for Sahaja Yogis because it is the most important period. That is, the seventh center we have crossed and we are on the eighth center.</b> We need not think of the Goddess what She did on the eighth day, we have to think today what we have to do within ourselves.<br>
After crossing the seventh day, after crossing the seventh chakra – that is the real ascent in your spiritual ascent. What are we to do on the eighth one?<br>
It’s so Sahaja that today should be Aṣhṭamī, because that is the day the Goddess killed so many evildoers, and demons and rākṣhasas. She did it on Her own, alone. Now, these evil forces are manifesting in human beings. They have spread out. They are within us. So <b>we all have to fight those forces within us</b>.<br>
The war is within ourselves, is not without. First, when you ascend the seventh chakra, when you are on the eighth step, you have to remember first you have to fight those forces within ourselves."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"And on an Aṣhṭamī, <b>that is today, is the eighth day of the Moon</b>, of the Moon which is increasing, Śhuklapakṣhi; that first time all the weapons of the Goddess are to be worshiped. This was a great idea because these weapons who work all the time, not only to kill the evil but to protect the good, were never worshiped before; and that today, if human beings realize their importance and significance, then lots of problems of atomic bombs and all these things that have been created could be solved by diverting them to the right direction, using them for the destructions of the evil forces and not the good; also for protecting human life, nourishing human life. The same weapons can be used in a wrong direction; but, rightly used, they can be dedicated for the use of God's work."</font><br>
