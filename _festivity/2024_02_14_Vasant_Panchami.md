<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we have the idea to do Saraswatī's Pūjā.</b> ...... I have seen that here people worship Mahākālī and Saraswatī, people worship Devī and people are simple natured. We should worship Saraswatī as well.<br>
Saraswatī's work is very great. <b>First, Mahāsaraswatī created the entire universe. The earth element is special in this. The earth element has been placed in such a way between the Sun and the Moon that any living work can easily happen on it.</b> From this living work, slowly and gradually human beings have been generated.<br>
But we should know our own great power. That power is what we call creation power, it's also called creativity.<br>
<b>This creation power is the blessing of Saraswatī by which many arts have been generated.</b> The evolution of art is due to the blessings of Saraswatī."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Today I thought we should have Mahāsaraswatī's Pūjā, would be a good idea. Because we did Mahālakṣhmī, let's have Mahāsaraswatī's.<br>
So, Mahāsaraswatī Principle is on the right side as I'd ... you all know. <b>First is the Brahmadeva's Principle, which is the Saraswatī Principle, and then this Mahāsaraswatī takes you to the Principle of Mahābrahmadeva called as Hiraṇyagarbha.<br>
Now this Hiraṇyagarbha Principle is very important for Sahaja Yogis.</b><br>
First of all, those who think too much or those who create too much without Realization, those who express themselves in poetry or in literature or in music, you can say, in paintings, in all kinds of arts; if they are not realized Souls, then they go to the left to the extreme or to the right."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"With the realization of the Ātmā, itself, the brain gets the incandescent of Śhrī Saraswatī and even the children who are weak in reading and writing start doing good work. After this, the growth of art begins. If one wants to develop art without Self-realization the art is not treated with respect [is unrecognized] and there is no name or sign of it and is eventually lost.<br>
So, first of all, <b>getting the Self-realization and then doing Saraswatī Pūjā is in itself a great thing</b>."</font><br>

<p style=" text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"Because Saraswatī had a <b>vīṇā in Her hand. And that vīṇā is the Primordial Instrument which She plays, like music. And the music penetrates into the heart.</b> You don't know how it goes into you and how it works out. <b>And that's how a person who is a Sahaja Yogi should permeate, like music, into everything.</b><br>
She has so many qualities as I told you which cannot be described in one lecture. But one of the greatest quality of Hers is: that She ends up into subtler things.<br>
Like the Mother Earth will end up into fragrance. Music will end up into melodies. Like that, whatever She creates ends up into something greater."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Saraswatī cleanses all that is impure in nature, while with our brain activity we are spoiling all that.<br>
All our brain activity goes against pure intelligence. And that's what one has to understand: that this pure intelligence is not to be soiled by our thinking. Our thinking can make us so bumptious, so ego-oriented, so impure that we can really eat the poison and say, `What wrong?' Just the opposite of Saraswatī. If Saraswatī will be in u ... is within us, <b>She gives us subuddhi, wisdom.<br>
And that's why, to worship Saraswatī, to worship Sūrya, we must have that clear vision as to what we have to be, what we are doing, what filth we are living in, what our mind is getting into. After all, we are here for emancipation and not for just pampering our ego and living with our filth that is with us.<br>
So, this Light has come within us and we should try to rise above our own mental filth, which is being created around us</b>."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"And as love will increase, your creativity will develop. So the basis of all creativity of Saraswatī is Love. If there is no love there's no creativity.<br>
It's even in the deeper sense, if you see, people who have created all the scientific things are also out of love to the masses, not for themselves. Nobody has produced anything for themselves. If they make something for themselves, it has to become for universal use, otherwise it has no meaning.<br>
......<br>
<b>So, all the activity on right-hand side of Saraswatī, basically has to end up in love: starts with love and ends up in love. Whichever does not end up in love, coils up and finishes off. It just disappears. So you can see that even matter which is not used for love just finishes off. The basis has to be love.</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"The second power you see on the right-hand side, yellow one, is the power to create. This has called as Mahāsaraswatī Power. In the Sanskrit language these are expressed much clearly, we can call it the creative power. <b>The Creative Power of God descends within us through this and is effective in giving us creative powers: of thinking power, of mental effort, and physical effort. So we put in our mental and physical efforts through this power, which is called as Mahāsaraswatī Power.</b>"</font><br>
