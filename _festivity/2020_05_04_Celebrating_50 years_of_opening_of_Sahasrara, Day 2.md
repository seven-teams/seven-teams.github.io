<font color="DarkRed">"<b>We can say, in 1970, fifth May, [for the] first time, the Collective Spirit of God opened out.</b><br>
So far, the blessings of God came to human beings individually as Grace and they received their Self-realization individually, one by one. And the method for individual Realization was just the opposite of the collective. First, they had to establish their dharma, cleanse themselves fully, desiring all the time for their salvation, putting their attention to their salvation, as you call it Īśhwarapraṇidhān [desire for God], thinking of God, asking for His Grace and acting in a scrupulous, dhārmik ways to keep themselves pure. They had to control their mind, control their desires, control their action in such a manner that they absolutely kept to the center path. And when they could get through all that testing and immunity, I mean they deserved, then only the Grace of Mother gave them Realization.<br>
This pattern was on for some time. These few people who got Realization did lots of wonderful things to prepare for Sahaj Yog. They were in every field of life, but very few and unique."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>I think the first era of Sahaja Yoga has ended now, and [a] new [era] has started. In the first era of Sahaja Yoga, the starting point was, first, the opening of the Sahasrāra, and gradually .... and gradually moving towards the completion,</b> I find there are so many who are great Sahaja Yogis today. It is a very natural process of growth that you have gone through.<br>
The first one was, we can say, is just the awakening of the Kuṇḍalinī, and piercing the fontanel bone area.<br>
As you see on top of your head these bandhans, that’s how you, too, have in your head, same way, and you have the chakras same way built-in on your ... in your Sahasrāra.<br>
So, in the first era of Sa...Sahaja Yoga we have awakened the Deities in your centers, in the medulla oblongata and also in the brain.<br>
But now the time has come for us to spread it on a horizontal level. And to move it on the horizontal level, we have to understand how to go about it.<br>
Like the seven colors of the rainbow, we have got seven colors of the light of these centers, of the chakras. And when we start it from the back, from the Mūlādhāra, bringing it up to the, this side, Āgñyā, then it is placed in a different order, if you see it clearly. I mean to say that in the Sahasrāra because it’s a concave pre ... placement is important to understand that the center of the fontanel bone area corresponds to our heart.<br>
So, heart is the pivotal point for the second era now."</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"So, if you have to place your attention to Sahasrāra, first thing you have to do is to pay attention to your heart.<br>
In the Sahasrāra, the Heart chakra and the heart itself, the Ātmā, coincide.<br>
<b>Means the Jagadambā becomes one with the heart, that is the Ātmā.<br>
So, we see that here the Yoga takes place.</b>"</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now, this Sahasrāra is to be looked after by you. Is the Temple of your Mother.</b> When you say you put Me in the heart, actually you put Me in the Sahasrāra. Because, as you know, the Brahmarandhra here [touches Hers], is the fontanel bone area, has got the Pīṭha, the center which controls the heart, which is the Seat of the Sadāśhiva, or you can say of Śhiva. So when you put Me in the heart actually you put Me there. So to raise it from heart to there, [laughing:] or to bring it from there to the heart, is the problem of two types of people."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So after so many days, the Sahasrāra has been opened out. We have to open out our Sahasrāra again.</b><br>
Through our meditative processes, through understanding ourselves and others, maybe logically reaching that point: 'There’s no way out now. We have reached to the end of it now. The whole logic has ended up now. Jump in the Ocean of Love. Finished!'<br>
Once you jump in the Ocean of Love there’s nothing to be done! Just to be enjoyed: every wave of it, every hue of it, every touch of it. That is what one has to learn by reasoning that, <b>'Sahaja Yoga is nothing but is Love.'</b><br>
May God bless you all."</font><br>

<b>Thank You for introducing us to a relationship to the Divine.<br> 
Thank You for finding us worthy.<br>

Thank You for giving us the joy of introducing a yearning seeker to Your redeeming Motherly Love.<br>
Thank You for inviting all of us to the court of the Goddess.<br>
Thank You for establishing the Kingdom of God on Earth.<br>
Thank You for accepting our offerings and prayers.<br>
Thank You for showering Your blessings endlessly upon us.</b><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>One thing we have to realize that Sahaja Yoga is Love and Divine Love, and it is not attachment, it is not possession, but it is a giving love. It is not love of the flesh. It is not love of any material thing, nor is the love of your faith, but is the Love of the Divine.</b><br>
This transformation really takes place if you really try to witness everything in its reality and see for yourself that, how, and why are you attached to something. Once it is discovered that we are detached in our witnessing state, then automatically the pure love starts flowing. As soon as you get your light, the sunlight, all the fog disappears. In the same way, as soon as you get Spirit shining in your attention, all your doubts, all your mistakes, disappear. This is what I told you today that you have to be aware of yourself because now you are friends of your Self, your Spirit."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Sahaja Yoga is the power of compassion and love of God Almighty.</b> But it's not just talk, just not giving you a lecture or a sermon, but it is actualization of the experience of this Divine Love. It is spirit-oriented, not money-oriented, nor is power-oriented. All the religions have failed outside because they are not Spirit-oriented."</font><br>

<b>Sahaja Yoginī: Can you give people Realization in their sleep?</b><br>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b> No. No. I cannot. I do not even want to give Realization to people when they are not facing Me, either My Photograph or Sahaja Yogis.<br>
That should not be. Because recognition is the only point in Sahaja Yoga.<br>
Modern Sahaja Yoga is only going to work out if you recognize Me.<br>
If you do not recognize Me, it’s not going to work out. This is the only way. This is the only key.<br> 
Because so far you have never recognized. Only on recognition all your past things will be forgiven, everything will be done.<br>
But if you refuse to recognize Me or you go slow with it, your progress will be slow. Which I have told you frankly.<br>
Though it’s rather [an] embarrassing job, but I have to tell you. This is a fact.<br>
So in dream you cannot give Realization. But in dream you might see the situation in which will be giving thing, how you should give.<br>
Your solutions will be suggested to you, how to approach a particular person. But you cannot give Realization to any one.<br> 
<b>They have to know that they have got Realization through Mātājī Nirmalā Devī.</b></font><br> 
As it is, when you give them Realization, they have no value. If they don’t know Me, they will have no value.<br>
