<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Had a very nice Pūjā in Pune which I had to perform on the thirteenth because it is the date called Akshaya Tritiya, means un-destructible [indestructible] third day of the moon. That’s actually nobody knew, but it is the Pūjā of the Kundalinī. That day everybody felt very, very clear. Very clear. Pūjā was hardly for about half an hour, the real Pūjā of the Kuṇḍalinī.</b> But everybody felt extremely clear and beautiful. So, that sort of Pūjā we should do tomorrow also, if possible, so that we’ll have the feelings of Sahasrāra completely opened out because even if Sahasrāra is opened, the rest of the chakras, if they are caught up then you have problems. It’s better to clear out all the chakras and then the Sahasrāra. So, tomorrow we’ll do the Pūjā in that fashion and I hope it will work out very well for all of you."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>She knows you very well and that is the reason why today we are here to worship our Kuṇḍalinī, to give Her all the credit, that ‘Oh, Mother, You have given us these great powers.</b><br>
You have given us this subtle knowledge within ourselves. You have given us the love which encompasses the whole world.’ And the more and the more you become aware of her connections – very, very delicate connections – then you’ll be amazed."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So this is what it gives you discretion, and Love is Truth.</b> So to this Kuṇḍalinī, which is nothing but, is the River, as yesterday they described Nirvaj, which doesn’t accept any compensation. The River of that Pure Love which has awakened us with such love, kindness and tenderness, we should try to use that power within ourselves to be like that because our job is, She has given us Realization for the emancipation of the whole world, not only our own."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So what we should ask for is that beautiful, soft, compassionate nature, and then the Kuṇḍalinī will supply because She only has that. Kuṇḍalinī doesn’t have anything else. <b>All Her Power is of love, nothing but love.</b> So how can She give you something She doesn’t have? Supposing you hate someone, what can She do? She can’t do anything because She cannot give you powers to hate. So what She says, ‘You hate someone. Hold or forgive.’ She gives you the power to forgive."</font><br>

The One who sustains the energy is Rādhā. And Dharā, which is the One which is sustenance itself, She sustains us. On Her we live."</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today, we have to know something about the connection of Sahaja Yoga with this Mother Earth. <b>It is very important, that we must understand the value of the Mother Earth.

<font color="DarkRed">And I [unclear] also, I just explained to you, <b>today is a day where, whatever you want to know of eternal nature, you can ask Me. And we'll ask for eternity.<br>
But many people think that today is a day when, whatever you ask, God has to give you. Is true.</b> Whatever you ask, you'll get it. But [is] just a temptation.<br>
Beyond that, is eternity. So whatever you have to ask, you should ask for something that is eternal, is indust ... indestructible. That higher state, we should call the Permanent State of Joy and Bliss, is to be asked today. Because all other askings are useless. And you again go back to the position where you were.<br>
Is important to understand, that this time, today, you have to ask something eternal for yourself, something eternal for your family, something eternal for your country, and something eternal for this world and universe.<br>
<b>You all are Sahaja Yogis, and of a very high level, and I'm happy that the all of you have come here for that Eternal State of Devī.<br>
And, if it works out, you should get that Eternal State [with]in yourself. You should get that state where you don't want anything anymore. and reside in that beautiful condition of complete peace and bliss.</b> That's what is available to you, but I ... you can easily achieve it.<br>
I cannot say this to people who are not Sahaja Yogis. But I can definitely say this to people who are Sahaja Yogis and who have achieved already Self-realization.<br>
So, today I hope, you all .. of you will pray and ask for that Eternal Love of God. It should flow to you all, all the time.<br>
May God bless you all.</font><br>
