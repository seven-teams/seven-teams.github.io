<font color="DarkRed">"I am the Ādi Śhakti incarnated. Once this Truth becomes one with yourself, there’s nothing to fear because all Deities know this fact. They know about this Incarnation very well. They’re all prepared for it and they’ll do anything to substantiate your belief.<br>
In every way they are trying to give you My Photographs, in the sky, this, that, I mean all sorts of
things. God knows what they are going to do today. They are so anxious. They are behind the stage, before the stage, all sides of the stage, listening to Me, feeling happy that I am telling you the Truth. But the way they recognize and the way they act, they never disobey.<br>
.......<br>
It’s very remarkable that, not only that you recognize Me as a Mother who loves you very much, but a Mother who is powerful to protect you. Is very powerful. If you realize that and if you feel that within your heart. Supposing I correct you some time, instead of feeling sad you should see that, ‘How fortunate I am that Ādi Śhakti Herself is correcting me. She’s taking interest in me. How fortunate I am to be born at this time, to be with Her in Her great work. What have I done [to deserve this]?’ <b>This recognition itself will fulfill all the Incarnations of Navarātri.</b>"</font><br>

To The Mahādevī,<br>
We Bow Again And Again.<br>
Let Those Who Have Ears Hear,<br>
Let Those Who Have Eyes See,<br>
Let She, The Auspicious One, The Great Queen,<br>
Grant Us To Be Victorious In Spreading Sahaja Yoga.</b></font>

<font color="DarkRed">"Now the tenth Navarātri today is to celebrate actually the Ādi Śhakti. So today we are really going to worship the Ādi Śhakti. On one side the Ādi Śhakti is Mahākālī, on the other side She is Mahāsaraswatī, in the center She is Mahālakṣhmī, and also She is the Ambā, the one who is the Kuṇḍalinī. But She's also beyond that. She's Parāśhakti, She's beyond all the powers because She is the Generator of Power, so She has to be beyond all that."</font><br>

<font color="MidNightBlue"><b>Jai jai Raghuvīra Samartha</b></font><br>
Victory to the all-powerful Śhrī Rāma!<br>
<font color="MidNightBlue"><b>Auṃ Twameva sākshāt Śhrī Rāma sākshāt Śhrī Ādi Śhakti Mātājī Śhrī Nirmalā Devyai namo namaḥ</b></font><br>
O Divine Mother, You are verily Śhrī Rāma. Salutations to You!<br>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today especially it's a very great day of Dussehra we call it. This is the day when, as you know, Rāvaṇa was burned. Effigies of Rāvaṇa are burnt all over the place. When Śhrī Rāma came this was done. His victory.</b> But in His victory, it was not that He made Sahaja Yogis or He gave Realization -- No! His victory was that He killed Rāvaṇa. That was done that time for today's preparation, for today's happenings. It was done long time back that these days will come when people will have a proper value system of the victory of Śhrī Rāma. But it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen, because this Incarnation of Mātājī Nirmalā Devī is very different, is very illusive -- Mahāmāyā.<br>
......<br>
So now, <b>I have to just tell you that, on this day of this Pūjā, it's such a combination that it's the Dussehra, I am here and also you can call it the last day of the Devī Pūjā.</b>"</font><br>

He has a sword in one hand and a bow and arrow in the other and spare arrows in His quiver to kill the rākṣhasas.<br>

He is beyond birth and death, His powers have no limits and through His own divine play (leela), 
He has incarnated to destroy all the negative forces and to protect this world.<br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"Śhrī Rāma was also a great Devī bhakta, that is, devotee of Śhakti.</b> Before attacking Sri Lanka He performed Devī Pūjā for which He needed a Brahmin for conducting various rites to please the Devī. He then sent for Rāvaṇa the King of Sri Lanka, who was a Brahmin and Devī bhakta. He readily responded and helped Śhrī Rāma in performing the Pūjā of the Devī with all nine types of rites.<br>
Had Śhrī Rāma been of a cunning disposition, He could have killed Śhrī Rāvaṇa then and there but He was a Maryādā Puruṣhottama. He did not do such a mean and irresponsible act. They were enemies but while performing the Pūjā the enmity was completely forgotten."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"That’s why I have to tell you that on this day of Dussehra, let us decide that we are going to have Rām Rāj in Sahaja Yoga, where there is benevolence, there is love, compassion, security, peace, joy, discipline among ourselves. The whole disciplining is within ourselves. What I say about Śhrī Rāma is that He Himself has put Himself into the discipline of maryādās. In the same way, we ourselves should put
ourselves into the discipline of maryādās."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So many powers Mother has to have to protect her children and to look after them. These powers are all there, working relentlessly all the time -- twenty-four hours. So anybody who surrenders to Mother, these powers express themselves and try to help you out of your problems. But first thing is surrendering. If you are not surrendered, if you are not in the Kingdom of the God, then this is not the responsibility of the Mother. Then it might be that some negative force might take over and may destroy you."</font><br>
