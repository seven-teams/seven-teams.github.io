<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So, today we have gathered here to worship Buddha.</b><br>
Lord Buddha, as you know, was Gautama: the One who was born in a royal family.<br>
And then, He became an ascetic. Because He was very much hurt to see three types of problems from which human beings suffer. And He came to [the] conclusion: ‘All these three types of problems are because we have desires.’ So He said that, “If you become desireless, then there will be no problem for you.”<br>
So He studied Vedas, He studied Upaniṣhadas, He studies [studied] all kinds of things, He went to many Saints and many people, [but] He could not get His Realization.<br>
Actually, He was an Incarnation.
The Incarnation also has to reach a point of Realization in a different way. Like the whole potential has to open out. But the Incarnation has tremendous potential. And that expresses itself once the door is opened outward."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"Buddha realized the greatest problem of human beings is his ego.<br>
In his ego, he goes to the extremes: from one end to another.<br>
And so He worked throughout on the Piṅgalā nāḍī for us, and stationed Himself on our ego, to control it."</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen"><b>Śhrī Mātājī, salutations to Thee again and again.<br>
Thou art the Primordial Splendor of God, the Ādi Śhakti and Mother of the Devatas.<br>
Thou art the roots of all action, the success in any action, and the sole and only Doer in the countless universes of Thy creation.<br>
Thou art Śhrī Mahāmāyā, the Mother of the Ādi Ahaṅkāra, the Primordial Ego of God, the Prince of Kapilavastu who became, by Thy grace, the Buddha.</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we have decided to celebrate the Buddha Jayanti, it's the day of Buddha's birthday.</b> In the whole map of time, Buddha came to this Earth at a time when it was so important for Him to come. That time, especially in India, we had two types of people: one, who were very ritualistic, trying to be extremely strict and disciplined; and the another were the people who were too much conditioned and were full of so-called devotion to God. So these two types of people were occupying the area of seekers. So it was necessary to neutralize these two styles of seekings. "</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now Buddha was one of the very Great Incarnations in the sense that He was the son, one of the sons of Rāma who incarnated on this earth, Buddha, to occupy the highest life on this earth.</b> So He had to take saṃnyāsa because without that He could not show that. But there was no need for anybody else to take saṃnyāsa. But in His case mistakes, I mean, why there were some mistakes about things, because when He tried all these tricks of saṃnyāsa, going here and there He never realized that this is all not needed. He was so tired and fagged out, that suddenly, spontaneous, the Primordial Mother Herself gave Him the Realization because He was so tired."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"The Pūjā to Shrī Buddha is being performed today to open this chakra.<br>
At the level of the Āgñyā chakra, there are thoughts. Because you are all connected with the same Divine Force there can be no difference of opinion."</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen"><b>Auṃ Twameva sākṣhāt Śhrī Siddhārtha Gautama Buddha sākṣhāt Śhrī Ādi Śhakti Mātājī Śhrī Nirmalā Devī namo namaḥ!</b></font><br>
O Divine Mother, You are verily Śhrī Buddha. Salutations to You!
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So the people who today are worshiping Buddha should know that His Message of Truth, which we know through our right side, through our attention, must be applied to ourselves, first of all.</b><br>
...... The problem with Sahaja Yogis sometimes is that they don’t know the importance of what they are, they are not aware. If their ego was correct, in that ahaṅkāra, ego, the essence of it is aham-bhāva, is that, ‘I am a Sahaja Yogi.’ I am a Sahaja Yogi.’ Now keep the point of honesty with it. ‘Honestly, I’m a Sahaja Yogi and I’m a follower of a religion, which is a Universal Religion, which is innately built myself. There’s no hanky panky about it. Is my experience, and I believe in it fully, and is innately within myself.’ This is the aham-bhāva. I don’t know what is it in the English language, is could be ‘I’-ness, ‘I’-ness.<br>
Then, “I am on this Earth now, this life is for the work of God. And for that, I have to be a pure person because I belong to Vishwa Nirmal Dharm. I have to be pure. I have to achieve my purity: through meditation through every way watching myself, ‘I have to be a pure person.’ And if I am a Sahaja Yogi, if I am united with that All-pervading Power of Love, I should be the medium to give that love to others and compassion. I have no time for other things. Other things are of no value. My attention has to be pure. My life has to be pure."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So, this special thing is that we are worshiping a Deity on the right Āgñyā which makes you think too much, first of all, and also it makes you aggressive, and also it makes you a very right-sided.</b> By this worship, you will become very mild, very gentle, very beautiful people and you’ll be able to see things much more clearly.<br>
Now, this right side gives you a kind of a ego which troubles everyone, but you could never feel the trouble till you get into a very serious state. It gives you the overactivity of the brain and conscious mind works too hard. For that you are, you are not very hard-working people, but you can see, first of all, that your mind is more active than your body. So, this Āgñyā chakra has to be controlled by Buddha, and that’s why we do Pūjā today."</font><br>
