<font color="DarkRed">"Today in India, we celebrate a set ... special festival. <b>It is called as Rakṣhā-bandhan. Rakṣhā means protection and bandhan means the bondage: the bondage of protection. Is a very nice, good, social custom to have this beautiful festival today.<br>
Today is the Full Moon Day, and this day what we do is to tie a band of threads around the person whom you want to protect. But it is done between brothers and sisters.</b> The sisters tie this bondage to the wrist of the brothers, and when they do that, they are putting all their love around the wrist, that it is the day for giving all their love, everything to their brother, as a protection, as a symbol of their protection through that thread. Is a very, very simple thread they use. And uh this is, has to be tied on the left-hand side. But people tie it on the right-hand side, which is a mistake. But it has to be tied on the left-hand side."</font><br>

<font color="blue">"Now this rākhī is nothing but the Viṣhṇumāyā's Power, which protects the brother. Actually, there the brother [Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa] protected Her, and now the sister's love protects the brother.<br>
So the relationship between brother and sister is much more important than any other relationship. Because it's so pure, is so protective, is so loving, and also it is of an equal age."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So the relationship between Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa and Viṣhṇumāyā is that of a brother and a sister.<br>
And surprisingly, the other day we celebrated the Rākhī Bandhan, the Rakṣhābandhan, which is the same thing as the brothers-sisters relationship.<br>
So now here we are celebrating actually the Deity which is the Sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br>
Later on She was born as Draupadī. And that's why Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa went to save Her chastity, because is the brother only who is concerned about the chastity and the name of the sister."</font><br>

<b>Auṃ Twameva sākṣhāt Śhrī Pāvitrya Dāyinī sākshāt<br>
Śhrī Ādi Śhakti Mātājī Śhrī Nirmalā Devī namo namaḥ!</b><br>
O Divine Mother, You are verily the One who gives chastity, the Foundation of all dharmas.<br>
Salutations to You!<br>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now Viṣhṇumāyā's Power is very important to understand, because Mother Power is to protect your innocence, because that is the most important thing. To protect your innocence is the Mother's Power.</b> Now, Viṣhṇumāyā's Power is to protect your chastity. You don't understand sometimes what is chastity and what is innocence. Innocence is a power which is not acted upon. Like we have electricity in our house, the electricity exists like innocence exists within us; but enactment of that is done through chastity. A person can say, 'I did this very innocently' -- no, he cannot. Because whatever you do if it is innocent, cannot be harmful to your character, to your innocence or to your righteousness.<br>
So those people who say like this, that, 'I did it innocently,' are wrong, because innocently if you do anything it becomes chastity. So when innocence is practiced it becomes chastity. You must have respect of your chastity. <b>Chastity is the one which is Viṣhṇumāyā's Power within us, Gaurī's Power, is the pure virgin.</b><br>
......<br>
Now to understand the significance of chastity within us, we have to know that <b>chastity is the foundation of all dharmas</b>. Unless and until you have sense of chastity you cannot have dharma. Dharma is not possible because that's the foundation. It will be a house of cards; if you do not have the foundation of chastity it will just collapse in no time."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now our Viṣhṇumāyā Principle is to be always kept very alert because it helps us in many ways.</b> First of all it helps us to pass the messages from your heart to your head. It is the one by which we integrate. Our heart and head is integrated by the Viṣhṇumāyā Principle more than the Viśhuddhi on the right side.<br>
Viśhuddhi on the right side can create collectivity, can create understanding with each other but on the left side it helps you to keep a complete integration between your heart and your head.<br>
If there is a guilt you just think of it and analyze it. It means that there's a struggle between you in your heart and your mind, isn't it? Simple as that. If it was integrated you would not feel guilty. And that is why all these artificial theories that have come, all these artificial yarns that you have read and all that, you forget it.<br>
<b>You are a Sahaja Yogi and you have entered into the Kingdom of God -- enjoy! That's all you have to do. But you have to get to that state of enjoyment and understanding that you are above all.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="blue">"This Viṣhṇumāyā is the one who has helped you because <b>She is the Sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa</b>, and because this is the domain of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, She came down here to help you.<br>
Now She's the Sister -- this must be understood very well. Now sisterly relation is a pure relationship."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So now here Viṣhṇumāyā is the One who is the virgin. Not only that She is a virgin, but She exist[s] in all the five elements, as shown that She [Śhrī Draupadī] married five Pāṇḍavas. And that, this power of virginity in Her, used to expose people to the dangers of these horrible Kauravas who were going to rule and destroy the dharma. See, so She stood back. And She is the one who said that, "You have to fight. You have to fight for dharma, whatever may happen."<br>
And Kṛiṣhṇa always supported Her. So, as a brother, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa supported Her.<br>
So the relationship between brother and sister are very important, in India. Also should be with Sahaja Yogis, because we have Rākhī Bandhan. You also have what you call the Bhāī Dūj, where on Diwālī Day we tie up a rākhī to the brother.<br>
<b>Now this rākhī is nothing but the Viṣhṇumāyā's Power, which protects the brother. Actually, there the brother [Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa] protected Her, and now the sister's love protects the brother.<br>
So the relationship between brother and sister is much more important than any other relationship. Because it's so pure, is so protective, is so loving, and also it is of an equal age.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So, this day is uh extremely important, in a way, for Sahaja Yogis to observe, and I'm happy that I am here, because it's very important also for America.</b><br>
Uh as I told you that, I have already talked to you how the-ee war between Alexander and Puru's was finished because of a sister's intervention.<br>
And, also, how Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, whose sister was Draupadī, Viṣhṇumāyā was born as Draupadī, and how He came to save Her chastity, by rushing all the way from Dvārika.<br> 
So, we can see that when we ascend in the Collective Consciousness and we have collective living, collective meeting, at the Viśhuddhi chakra, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa establish[ed] this, or He manifested uh this pure relationship of a sister.<br>
In a collective life that we have, in the Āśhram where we live, where we move about as Sahaja Yogis, if we do not have this basic principle within us, there will be a chaos, complete chaos. Once this purity of relationship is established, that apart from my wife, all the rest are my sisters or mothers, it cannot be a proper society and <b>the chaos of the social system of America is because they have no sense of pure relationships.<br>
Once you call somebody a sister, she's a sister. And once you call somebody a brother, she's [he's] a brother. It's not only that you should be born of the same parents, it's not necessary, but this is a very important principle to have a very pure society where everybody can live peacefully.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">Many blessings,<br>
Received your rākhīs conveying your deep love. Rākhī is Protecting Power. Its bond is very strong and extremely tender because it symbolizes the noble love of sister. Customarily, <b>tying a rākhī to someone is establishing a place of Pure Protection</b>. However, man's ability to understand love has become so feeble that tying of rākhī has become merely a mechanical process. All beautiful human traditions become lifeless and dry formalities if there is no warmth of faith in them.<br>
......<br>
<b>Rākhī Pūrṇimā is a day of great significance. On that day you should ask for perfection, make big decisions and keep attention on high ideals.</b> Sahaja Yogis should not destroy their attention on trifle issues. Lot of work has yet to be done. Those Sahaja Yogis who have progressed should get busy. New centers should be opened. People should be cured of their diseases and their attention should be drawn towards God-realization.<br>
Please show this letter to all Sahaja Yogis.<br>
Always remembering you<br>
<b>-- Your Mother Nirmalā</b></font><br>
