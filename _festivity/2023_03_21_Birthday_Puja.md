<font color="DarkRed"><b>"First of all, you have to know you are Prophets and you must know that I am the Holy Ghost. I am the Ādi Śhakti. I am the one who has come on this Earth for the first time in this form to do this tremendous task. The more you will understand this, the better it would be. You will change tremendously.<br>
I knew I will have to say that openly one day and we have said it.
But now it is you people who have to prove it, that I am that."</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>O Param-pūjya Śhrī Mātājī Nirmalā Devī,<br>
Out of the Highest Realm of Divinity, You have come on this Earth only because of Your infinite love, compassion and benevolence.<br>
Your powers, which created all the universes, are insurmountable. Your completeness is such that everything that exists, that has existed and shall ever exist is contained within Your Indescribable Being.<br>
Despite that, O Supreme Mother, out of Your immeasurable love, You assumed a form similar to ours, to give us guidance, protection, and salvation.</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"Many people have always asked Me that why God created this Universe ......<br>
...... we can say that God created this Earth, just to please His own children, just to make them happy,<br>
just to make them enter into the Kingdom of God, to give all that what He has got.<br>
So He had to create this creation in such a way that He could create His own image, reflect it and make it enjoy itself."</b></font><br>

Of course, it will work, but otherwise also, whether there is necessity or not, there’s an urge in the human beings to rise, rise above all these human failures.<br>
<b>I bless you from My heart, bless you very much, that you carry on your work of Sahaja Yoga, of spreading Sahaja Yoga, of giving Realization.</b> You have got powers. You know you have [got].

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>You needed a Mother to look after you, to care for you, and to be able to transform you with a lot of wisdom.</b> So every birthday I find that Sahaja Yogis are also expanding their hearts and realizing that they are no more drops but they are part and parcel of the Ocean.<br>
And that the Ocean itself is going to strengthen them and look after them. It’s the Ocean that is going to nourish them. And the same Ocean is going to guide them. So the connection between a drop and an Ocean has to be fully established. So the limitations of a drop have to be absolutely dissolved into the greatness of the Ocean.<br>
With care and with nice things to say we can improve the depth of the collectivity, and with sincere desire to be collective. The desire to be collective has to be very sincere. So, this expanse of your being will start.<br>
The first thing is needed: a sincerity to yourself."</font><br>
