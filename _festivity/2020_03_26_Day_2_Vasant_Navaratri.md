<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Within us is placed this residual energy in the triangular bone – called as Kuṇḍalinī. This is the energy of desire which is not yet manifested. It is pure desire and it is the Ultimate Desire. It is the desire to be one with the Divine. We can say the Union with the Divine. That is the Yoga.</b> This is placed in the triangular bone which is called as sacrum, means sacred. The Spirit, the reflection of God Almighty, is placed in your heart. But the Seat of your Spirit is on top of your head here. Like as you may have the king moving all over the places, but the seat is a fixed place. Unless and until this Union takes place, the manifestation of this residual power does not take place. This manifestation has to take place. This is the last breakthrough of our evolution. This is what has been described as the Second Birth – as the Baptism. It is also in Sanskrit language is called as the Second Birth, like an egg becoming the bird. So bird also in Sanskrit language is called as dvijaḥ – means twice-born. This happening has to take place – has been described by all the Scriptures."</font><br>

<b>O Divine Mother, You are verily Shri Brahmadeva-Saraswati. Salutations to You!</b>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"If you start from the Mūlādhāra chakra upwards then we have got on the second chakra, Swādhiṣhṭhāna chakra Śhrī Brahmadeva who is the creative power, creative aspect of God and His Power is Saraswatī. You have seen that in Delhi you are all being caught on the Swādhiṣhṭhāna chakra. All of you have got this problem of Swādhiṣhṭhāna chakra because Delhi is the place where we are planning too much and the power of planning and the power of future thinking comes from Swādhiṣhṭhāna chakra and that’s how many of you are caught up in the Swādhiṣhṭhāna chakra"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"When Kuṇḍalinī crosses six chakras, it is called as complete Nirmal Vidyā.</b> The Desire of God
enlightens all the chakras and pure elements are established in you, means all the Deities get awakened. 
They are awakened and you start getting their attributes."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="LightSalmon">"Is left Swādhiṣhṭhāna, as we call it and when you catch on this you have to say that you believe in the Divine Working – in <b>the Pure Working of the Divine and that’s called as Nirmala Vidyā. Nirmala Vidyā means the Pure Knowledge of the technique of how to raise your Kuṇḍalinī.</b> When you say that, this gets all right and the spirits leave you. There are many people who have come to Me who have been mad, and they say, “How by Kuṇḍalinī do you cure mad people?” What do you do about it. Nothing, I just give them Kuṇḍalinī awakening. Then when the Kuṇḍalinī awakens, when She goes to this center, the second center within us, the enlightenment takes place. The Deity there of creativity gets awakened and with the light this darkness within you just disappears. Just goes away."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"Sahaja Yoga is the integration of all the Truths of Life and I can prove it to you, on the Kuṇḍalinī, that what I say is the fact – is the fact. <b>Unless and until you take Hazarat ʿAlī’s name your Swādhiṣhṭhān chakra cannot be cured</b>, and all the Sahaja Yogis know about it. And in the Sahaja Yogi Pūjā we have to take the name of Muhammad Sāhib again and again and that of Hazarat ʿAlī."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>To do the Pūjā of these five elements is to do the Pūjā of Śhrī Brahmā because these are His weapons. These too have been given to Śhrī Prajāpati by the Mother.</b> Light was created when She saw [opened Her eyes]. That’s why the Tanmātra [essence of the element] of Tej [glow] was created. When the Mother inhaled Fragrance [She smelled with Her nose], this Earth was created out of that fragrance. In this way, the element of Earth was created. The element of Sound [Sound is the causal of the ether element] was created when the Mother spoke. You can call it Nād. In this way, the Tanmātras were created and the elements were created from these Tanmātras. All this is the work of Śhrī Prajāpati, of Śhrī Brahmadeva."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Brahmadeva represents that aspect of God Almighty which manifests as the Creator of both the subtle side (esthetics), and of the gross side of material creation.<br>
Brahmadeva looks like an ascetic, a saintly personality, with a beard and mustache. He has four heads and all the hair on His heads is tied up in a top-knot.<br>
His body is thin with His most prominent feature being bulging and very large eyes.<br>
Brahmadeva rarely incarnates but He has incarnated once as Hazarat ʿAlī, husband of Fāṭimah and son-in-law of Muhammad Sāhib.<br>
Some ancient Sages tried to explain the meaning of His four heads as the expression of creation into four Vedas. The meaning of His heads is much wider and deeper, though.<br> 
Brahmadeva the symbol of the Creative Power of the Supreme, the Īśhwara, Brahma, God.<br>
This creative power is expressed through the plane of matter in this universe.<br>
All material things have three dimensions but there is a fourth dimension which only human beings can see and feel."</font><br>
