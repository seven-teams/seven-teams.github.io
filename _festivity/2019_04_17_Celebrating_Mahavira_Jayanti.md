<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are going to celebrate the birthday of Mahāvīra.</b><br>
Mahāvīra is the Incarnation of Bhairavanāth, or you call Him as Saint Michael. Now these two Saints as you know one as the Gabriel, Hanumāna, and another is Saint Michael. One is placed on the Piṅgalā nāḍī and another one, Saint Michael, on the Iḍā nāḍī."</font><br>

<font color="blue">Now Mahavira also was one of them,<br>
who was born again and again and he was Markandeya and he was Kabira,<br>
the way Kabira lashes people you can see that he is tremendous,<br>
<b>He is like Bhairava and the Power of Bhairava, ......</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"The ascetic life of Mahāvīra was of a very, very extreme nature. He was the one who was born in a clan of warriors, Kṣhatriyas, and then He was also married. Also He had a daughter and then He decided because He knew He had to do the work of the Divine, He decided to take a saṃnyāsa. So He took the permission of His brother because His parents were dead. He was a king, so He gave up all His material wealth everything and He became a complete saṃnyāsī and He left His family, left His house everything behind and went alone with a little bowl for begging alms. And the people who joined Him were very few and He asked them that you have to also become ascetics, Munis.<br>
He was a Reincarnation of Saint Michael and He resides on the left side on the Iḍā nāḍī. And He looks after the whole of it right from Mūlādhāra onwards up to the Sahasrāra. So St Michael was born as Mahāvīra meaning the greatest warrior. But when He was born the whole place got lot of prosperity.<br>
That’s why <b>He was called as Vardhamān to begin with</b>."</font><br>

<b>Aum twameva sākshāt Shrī Vardhamana sākshāt<br>

O Divine Mother, You are verily the one who makes us progress and evolve.<br>
Salutations to You!<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"That’s why, <b>I think, this Mahavira Jayanti is a very great thing for us to observe.</b> Now, why was He called Mahavira? Because only a person like Him – Vir means a person who is brave, who is chivalrous – because only He could do this, so only He could enter into the being fully and could kill or, you can say, destroy those horrible rakshasas, devils, all these negative things that come to us.<br>
Now, as you know, we use left side very much for so many negativity that is torturing us, but if there is no help, say, from Mahavira, we cannot do it. You call the name of Mahavira – you could call Him Saint Michael, you can call Him by any name, but Mahavira because He was a human being. All this works out because of Him and He’s such a great identity."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Even though Saraswatī has created all the Swaras, so what! but the emotions it contains, the bhakti it contains it is due to the blessings of Mahāvīr.<br> 
Mahāvīr has really worked hard for this because he scared people that if you go to the wrong way, you go to hell, and on taking this correct way you will be overwhelmed and you all are actually witnessing it. Like this we all should increase our bhakti and growing bhakti in the work of Mahāvīr. I am happy that on this day of Mahāvīr Jayanti you all are doing Mahāvīr’s work ......<br>
In Sahaja Yoga we recognize Lord Mahāvīra as the Incarnation of Śhrī Bhairavnāth. He also incarnated as Imam Husayn. Saint Michael is the same who is also called Saint George [the Guardian angel of London]."</font><br>
