<font color="DarkRed">"As you know, <b>on the Day of Holī, Holikā was burnt</b>. Agni [God of Fire] had a very big blessing and task, because Agni Devatā had given Holikā a boon that in any circumstance, she will not burn, that death could come to her in any form, but not by fire. And after giving this boon, he regretted a lot because she took Prahlād in her lap and sat in the fire. And Agni Devatā had a big dilemma, that “I have given this promise to her, that I will not burn her and how can I fulfill this promise? And Prahlād, is Himself innocence personified, He is Himself an Incarnation of Śhrī Gaṇeśha and how can I burn Him? Nobody can burn Him. And He is also beyond my powers. He is formed from my power.” So he thought, “What is this ego? that in front of such a Great Power what can I talk about my power? I have no such power which can face Him. His Power is so great that I cannot burn Him whatsoever I may try. But at this time I have a very big dilemma in front of me.”<br>
So in between duty and dharma the dilemma is in between these two. In this situation, we must understand that dharma is higher than duty. <b>The duty of dharma is higher than a normal duty and even higher is the Dharma of the Ātmā.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"[SYNOPSIS!]<br>
[People Celebrate Holī only on the outside, the real Holī is to be burnt within first. This means the negativity within has to be burnt first. Delhi being the capital is full of politics. Sahaja Yogis absorb this politics and it spreads in the Sahaja collectivity like flu. We cannot ascend by it. We should not form any groups or believe to any caste. Someone like Nārad Muni comes along and fans the flames of animosity one against the other. But we should not play into the hands of such people. We should realize that our relationship is with Mother only.]</font><br>

<font color="Blue"><b>[SYNOPSIS!]<br>
[On Holī we should burn all those things which spoil our attention and damage the Āgñyā. Then this attention will clear out and we will celebrate Holī with joy and understanding. The day the complete combination of this will happen then on both chakras the similarity will come. Then at Sahasrāra the question does not arise.]</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"The experience of God’s Love has been described in many books of ours but nobody believes in them. 
For example, when Prahlād, in whose presence Narasiṃha incarnated, was asked, “What do you want?” he replied, 
<b>“Tav Charaṇa arvinde prīti" [The love of Your Lotus Feet], that is, “O God, give me the love of Your Lotus Feet.”</b> "</font><br>
