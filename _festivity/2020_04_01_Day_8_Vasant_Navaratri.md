title: '2020 Celebrating Vasant Navarātri: "Ā-gñyā, āgñyā means obedience or to order. It can mean both the things. If you order to someone it is an āgñyā and the one who obeys the order is an āgñyākāri[n]. The one who does the āgñyā." '

<font color="DarkRed">"All these seven centers you see are very nicely planted. They are there. And all the Deities of different characters, like innocence is the first Deity, are there. <b>When the Kuṇḍalinī is awakened, She awakens the different Deities.</b><br>
<b>By awakening those Deities, you get the reward of those Deities.</b> As I told you yesterday when It crosses this, you get Christ awakened. Of course, not this, it is inside on the crossroads of optic chiasma, you can say, which there is a center called as Āgñyā chakra. And this center looks after your pituitary and pineal body. When the Kuṇḍalinī rises, She enlightens all these centers. Christ is enlightened. And the ego and superego which create the idea of sin and the idea of karmas is sucked in – through Christ."</font><br>

<font color="blue"><b>"Many people among you have become thoughtlessly aware. I know this. 
It means that upon closing your eyes if you look at your mind then there is no thought.</b><br>
If there is only thoughtless awareness then you should know that the Kuṇḍalinī has crossed the Āgñyā chakra and has spread in the Sahasrāra chakra but has not pierced through here.<br> 
But if someone is getting a Cool Breeze in their hands then they should know that the Brahmarandhra has been opened."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today we are talking about the sixth chakra called as Āgñyā chakra. [Pause]. The gnya, gnya word means ‘to know’, gnya is to know. And a means ‘the whole’. Āgñyā chakra also has another meaning. <b>Ā-gñyā, āgñyā means obedience or to order</b>. It can mean both the things. <b>If you order to someone it is an āgñyā and the one who obeys the order is an āgñyākāri[n]. The one who does the āgñyā.</b><br>
This sixth chakra was created in the human beings when he started thinking. Thinking is language expressed."</font><br>

<font color="Maroon">"Now this Incarnation is placed in this Āgñyā chakra of ours, here in the center, where the optic nerve or optic thalamus cross each other like this. In the center is a very subtle point which moves both the sides like this and like that and it creates two sounds ‘Ham’ ‘Kṣham’, ‘Ham’ ‘Kṣham’, ‘Ham’ ‘Kṣham’. ‘Ham’ is on the right-hand side where you have seen the superego is there and ‘Kṣham’ is on the left-hand side where the ego is. <b>Now these two sounds create two kinds of vibrations.</b> I would say the mantra for the right-hand side is ‘Ham’ and for the left-hand side is ‘Kṣham’.<br> 
...... Now the superego on the left-hand side and ego on the right-hand side is ‘Kṣham’.<br>
The right-hand side is the ego, which is real problem, you understand that!<br>
......<br>
<b>Those who have ego must learn, if they feel hurt they must say, ‘forgive’. Then another person hurts them, say, ‘forgive’. And not only forgive but ask for forgiveness.</b> Both things should be done, more asking for forgiveness. You have to ask for forgiveness if you have too much of ego. It is very important. Because if you have too much of ego means what? That you have pampered it too much. That means you have used it too much. You have dominated people and that’s why you have such a lot of ego. If you have such a lot of ego you must all the time try to humble down in your heart. Now in the heart resides the Spirit. <b>The ego, too much of ego in a person, always takes you away from that Spirit. That’s why it is said, “Humble down in your heart.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="blue">"God has created you, you have not created yourself. 
Who are you to destroy yourself? You have no business. 
<b>And this is what is to be understood by Sahaja Yogis that you have no business to destroy yourselves and you have no business to spoil yourselves.</b>
You have to understand that now you are ... If you understand really, in the way that I call it part and parcel, what is a Bodha – that is, it becomes a part and parcel of your nervous system, that you are a Yogi then no virus can attack. What is virus? Nothing can attack you, nothing can trouble you. And even if they attack, it will come for a short time and will go away. Even if they attack, it will come and go away. But it will not stay in your body. It cannot stay long ......"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"But the most surprising thing is that when it happens to you, <b>when the Kuṇḍalinī rises piercing all these centers and opens out of the fontanel bone, then you start feeling the vibrations flowing in your hands, is the actualization</b>. What flows through you is the pulsation of the Spirit. And you can see the pulsation flowing through you through which you can judge your own centers and the centers of the others, because you jump into a new awareness called as collective consciousness. Actually, it is actualization.<br>
......<br>
It’s an actualization within you that you start feeling others within you, that you know that we are part of the whole. Not through your brain, but through actualization in your awareness it happens. Unless and until that happens to you, you are not to believe anybody. We are seeking the wholesomeness, our wholesomeness. We are seeking our relation with the whole. We have to become the whole. For that, there is this mechanism placed within you, and when this happens, you start feeling the whole. And this is what is you are seeking.<br>
But actually what happens [is] that it works on you like a human awareness, you get another awareness which you can call as superconsciousness. But there are other consciousness which we can call as the subconscious mind and the supraconscious.<br>
Like in the past is the subconscious. <b>Supraconscious is the future.</b> That’s on the left and the right. You can start moving on these lines. And there could be some spirits, some dead spirit, they may jump on to you and you will start behaving in such a manner that you cannot control. What is going to happen is that the Kuṇḍalinī rises very smoothly within you and gets that state. You become that. It is the becoming through this happening."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>Shrī Mātājī:</b> Photograph like this, and light in front. It will improve your eyesight also. 
My Hands should be used, very good for the eyes.<br>
My Hands are extremely good for your eyes.<br>
If you can see My Hands with the light, very good for your eyes.</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"All your nervousness and everything can be cured if you have pure eyes. But it is such a vicious circle that, through your eyes, you gather all the bad, and is accumulated in the Āgñyā and you have to clear the Āgñyā to make the eyes clear. It’s a vicious circle. But it can start at a point as I said, we have to ask for forgiveness. Secondly we have to bring Christ in our Āgñyā chakra. Thirdly we have to give up all drugs and all intoxicants and all smoking.<br>
That happens automatically when you are a Sahaja Yogi, it will work out. But eyes express the whole of your being, your brain, your body, your limbs everything. And if your Āgñyā is all right then your eyes are perfectly all right. They emit nothing but love wherever they glance. Only with a glance of your eyes you can raise the Kuṇḍalinī. Only with the glance of your eyes you can cure people. Only with your glance you can bring joy into the destroyed and the ruined people.<br>
So these eyes which you see are the windows of your being, of your heart. When the Spirit is expressed through your eyes, you must have noticed yourself that, when the Kuṇḍalinī rises then the eyes become dilated."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>Shrī Mātājī:</b> Now what are good My feet for?<br></font>
<b>Sahaja Yogi: Āgñyā.</b><br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Shrī Mātājī:</b> Very good for ego. And also superego. Is very good for people who suffer from ego or superego, My Feet.<br>
Because, such people are very gross. And the Feet solve the problem.<br>
<b>So just use My Feet.</b><br>
If they see My Face, the ego will start working, “This Face is like that, it should be like that – this, that.”<br> 
Superego might give problems. Even supraconscious will give you problems.<br>
But Feet, even if you are supraconscious, they’ll correct your problems.<br>
Feet are not only powerful but they go up to the grossest point where you are.<br>
Any type of person. Say, a drunkard and all the bad thing you are talking, a criminal. Some sort of a man.<br>
You just use My Feet, he’ll be alright. Face won’t work for him.<br>
Face is for the seekers. But for all such people who are absolutely incorrigible type, Feet is the best.<br>
Those who have extreme ego, those who have extreme superego – extreme.<br>
Feet are very important.<br>
You also sometimes watch My Feet. That’s a very good way, exercise.<br>
<b>Just watch My Feet to get rid of your grossness. Just watch with your eyes.</b></font><br>
