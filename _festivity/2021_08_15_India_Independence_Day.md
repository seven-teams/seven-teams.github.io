<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we celebrate our freedom from that slavery that we had for three hundred years. But slavery does not go easily only by celebrating our independence day. It has to go completely from our minds.</b> And one has to realize that we are really independent people now.<br>
We are independent it does not mean that we are abandoned people. Those who have not paid anything to achieve this independence cannot understand also the value of this independence. The slavery is in our mind still lingering on.<br>
Indians are now more westernized, anglicized than they were ever before. Before independence, as they had to struggle out of it they protested. But when we became independent we started thinking that we should also imbibe all the bad qualities from the West. So this is also a kind of a slavery which is very subtle. Also, the people who ruled us are still carrying on with the idea that [they are] still ruling us. Is all imaginary. Both things are imaginary. They don’t exist anymore. As far as we are concerned in India, we have to know that this independence was granted to us through God’s Grace. We have won it through nonviolence and truth, and granted to us, for us to achieve our spiritual ascent. To become spiritually enlightened and find out from our root what Truth has been laid for us."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"We have seen those days too when our country was not independent but you people are liberated now. Now we are independent. And what is swatantra [independence]? <b>Know the Swa – one Self and the tantra – mechanism. Know the mechanism of one Self.</b><br>
Through Sahaja Yoga you have known your Self and you know the technique or the mechanism of knowing one Self."</font><br>

Thy dreadful name from shore to shore?<br>

Thou who savest, arise and save!<br>
To her, I cry who ever her foeman drove<br>

And shook herself free<br>
Mother, to thee I praise thee.</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>We got our independence and graciously English left us</b>, that was something really great of them, in those days to do it. But that independence was just a political independence, political freedom but today you have the ultimate, ultimate freedom. You got the freedom of your spirit which is not attached to anything, which is not anything but the spirit, which is absolute, which is neither English nor Indian nor Australian, which is not this house, which is not anything but the spirit itself, the complete freedom you’ve got. In that freedom, you have to rise."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Mahālakṣhmī's Incarnation is very important for Sahaja Yoga. First She establishes our dharma by which we become righteous, we become religious in the real sense.</b> After the light of Realization we cannot do anything that is not dharma. As you know what is dharma is, and the maryādās, the boundaries of our behavior. This transformation takes place automatically. I don't have to tell you, ``Don't do this, don't do this," like Ten Commandments. You, yourself, establish your dharma and you enjoy your virtues. This happens, as you know -- already has happened to all of you -- with the Grace of Mahālakṣhmī. Then She starts bestowing blessings on you."</font><br>
