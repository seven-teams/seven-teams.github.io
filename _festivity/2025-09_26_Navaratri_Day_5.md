<font color="DarkRed">"The Devī has many forms, but is the Embodiment of the Śhakti. Ādi Śhakti gives Śhakti to all these Embodiments.<br>
And so, there are many Goddesses we have. At different times, They came on this Earth, and did all that was necessary for the ascent of people who were seekers.<br>
Specially, the One we know of <b>Jagadambā, the Durgā, She was trying to protect all the Seekers of Truth and to destroy all evil forces</b>.<br>
Because without the ascent of human beings, they do not know the Truth. And that's why, whatever they try to do is a mental projection.<br>
And this mental projection, if it is not sumsti ... substantiated by Truth, by dharma, it declines. In Sanskrit they call it glāni.<br>
<b>When this glāni takes place, then Incarnations are born to solve the problem.</b><br>
In all Incarnation of the Goddess, there have been very much incarnated, the satanic forces, they had incarnated, and She had to fight them ... with them, and destroy them. But this destruction was not for the destruction's sake that, `The evil forces are to be destroyed,' but evil forces always try to put down the seekers, put down the Saints, try to hard ... harm them, sometimes even destroy [them].<br>
All these destructive forces do not come at the same time, normally. At different times: is easy to handle.<br>
But <b>the aim of the Incarnation is to save, to protect the people who are seekers, because they are the most important people in the realm of spirituality</b>."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now you are worshiping today the Durgā, or all the Nine Forms of the Goddess.</b> She came nine times on this Earth, according to this, that She fought all the people who were destroying the seekers, who were trying to make a mess of their lives. And these tortured Saints, when they prayed to the Goddess -- because none of the Gods could do anything, and Sadāśhiva is never interfering with what the Goddess is doing -- so they worshiped the Bhagavatī, and then the Incarnation of Hers came nine times, according to the need of the time.<br>
So every time you find Her confronting people who are extremely arrogant, self-opinionated, thinking no end of themselves. And the bhaktas are tortured by these self-opinionated horrible rākṣhasas. "</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we have gathered here to do the Navarātri Pūjā.</b><br>
There were nine times when the Major Incarnations of the Mother of this Universe were manisfested [manifested]. They were manifested with a purpose. That purpose is to protect Her bhaktas, Her disciples, Her children.<br>
This was a binding love. She could not escape it. Mother's Love is binding. She cannot escape it. And She has to manifest it, work it out, and give that protection to all Her children."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"I would say, with this, today's special celebration of Navarātri. Like yesterday you saw Śhrī Durgā's Nine Forms, also. In that, one is <b>Kuṣhmāṇḍā, is one of the forms, that you absorb all the filth in yourself, in your stomach.<br>
But the Devī does that, not you. What the Devī can do, you should not do, that's Her job</b>, that She is supposed to do this, not you.<br>
What you have to do is to only be in silence so that you absorb whatever will increase that silence, will increase your depth. The Devī will look after all the rest of the things, She'll look after all the filth, all the anger, all the temper, all the everything that's going on in this world. She will absorb all that, but what you have to do is to just enjoy everything that is pure."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So we have made it short now, just take a bandhan, it is the same thing as kavacha, you see. Realized Souls, if they take bandhan is the same thing. Whatever you have said here is done, yesterdays and todays, everything that has been said, all these rakṣhākari [act of protection] is done in one stroke.<br>
But now we should know how many of us take bandhan before going from the house, before sleeping or before doing something important. How many people take bandhan. Very seldom you forget it. Very important, going on a journey, going on a road, better take a bandhan, not that we are all right, Mother is looking after us, is not the point. You must take bandhan before doing all these things.<br>
If you get an accident, then know that you have done some mistakes, or something otherwise, normally there should be not an accident, means there is something still lacking in you."</font><br>

ill-fortune in those of the vicious, intelligence in the hearts of the learned,<br>

May You protect the universe!”<br>
