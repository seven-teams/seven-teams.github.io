<font color="DarkRed">"<b>The attitude to the Pūjā should be, that you are enamored by the Devī. That you are praising the Goddess. It’s not an intellectual understanding, you see. It is, you are saying all these things just to please.</b><br>
So the attitude should be such, is not some sort of a[n] intellectual treatise, that is going on but it is, you are expressing oh Goddess! Like if you love someone, then you say something, just to please that person.<br>
In the same way you are saying to Goddess something. Now these Saints who have written are saying this. Just to express themselves that “You are Goddess, You are like this, You are that.” Some of the letters I receive also are like that. So much full of expression of their feeling. But it’s not a sort of a lecture course or anything. It is just the feeling of that attitude. So in complete ‘bhakti’ it should be done.<br>
Try to feel it in your heart, whatever is said, and that you are sitting before Me. You have to say that from your heart. This is what we are saying to You, with complete humility. It is the expression like a prayer. It is a prayer. Should be a prayer and not some sort of a[n] intellectual discussion. It is a prayer to Goddess. Unless and until you develop that attitude, you cannot go very far."</font><br>

I think it’s Spirit.<br> 
If the Spirit is awakened within you, you develop the bhakti and drop out all nonsensical ideas, all different things that have crawled into your head, but you just develop the bhakti."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"On today’s auspicious occasion we have gathered here. Today is the 7th day of the Goddess. On the 7th day, the Devī Goddess destroyed the various rākṣhasas and sinners, because they were torturing the great Saints and Ṛiṣhis who were doing meditation and penance.<br>
We wonder, “Mother, why they did so much penance? What was the need?” The reason for doing it was because although human ascent was still low, yet their aspiration was very high. They aspired to achieve the Ātmā through the body. That is why they worked so hard and did penance in this place. It is due to their aspiration that today we are able to achieve this height. This does not mean that we should think that because of the blessing of Sahaja Yoga we are some great people or some specially chosen people by God. People who think like that will receive a great shock. You will see that those who are simple, innocent, and good-natured will ascend foremost and the rest will be left behind. Therefore just receiving your Realization is not the end.<br>
<b>On this auspicious occasion, God Almighty has manifested all His śhaktis for your protection, benevolence and welfare. In everything God is blessing you. He wants to see you enter His Kingdom.</b> In a way it is His Desire that you should return to your Father’s home and enjoy its comforts. But at least we should be worthy of it. If we are not worthy of it then how can we enter it? We should examine our worthiness and see what it is."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Tonight we have gathered here to do the Pūjā to the Devī, that is Mahākālī we can call Her, or Durgā.</b> So many types of forms She has taken, to kill the negative forces that are trying to trouble or to obstruct, or even to grow the people who were gentle and good.<br>
Her forms are of different types – that we know about, that She destroyed so many rākṣhasas, She destroyed so many evildoers. Also, we do not know that, in the World Wars that we had, She was there to protect the right type of people. And that’s how they all survived the ill-blood plan, ill-gotten plan of very cruel and evil people."</font><br>

<p style="color:DarkSlateBlue; text-align:center;">
Salutations always to Durgā. Fortune for Her children and misfortune for Her enemies.<br>
Salutations always to Durgā who takes one across in difficulties, who is the essence, who is the holder of everything,<br>
Who is knowledge and discrimination, and who is blue-black and also smoke light in complexion.<br>
We prostrate before Her who is at once most gentle and most terrible.<br>
We salute Her again and again.<br>
 Salutations to Her who is the support of all the world.<br>
Salutations to the Devī who is the form of volition.<br>
O Queen of all, You who exist in the form of all, and possess every might, save us from error, oh Devī.<br>
Salutation be to you, Devī Durgā.

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Bhakti is love; and love which is understanding, which understands what is bhakti and śhraddhā.</b> Unless and until you develop that bhakti and śhraddhā within you, you cannot rise. You cannot rise above your problems. You cannot rise about your personal estate. Because bhakti is something you cannot impose on anyone. You cannot force on anybody. Ha [Yes], you can make somebody mad and say that he can do bhakti – he cannot. You have to have all your qualities absolutely intact. You should be intelligent, you should be understanding – everything should be there. But at that time this – the joy of bhakti – is within you. And this joy of bhakti when it starts flowing, Goddess Herself enters into your being, I should say."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So what is necessary very much in the country like America, is the devotion and bhakti.</b> These two things are not there. Indians take to Sahaja Yoga and go deep down into. Because they know what is bhakti, what is devotion. All this ego and all that melts away. But this bhakti is to be enjoyed. I don’t know how to create bhakti within you – that I can’t say. But I’ve seen people with bhakti – they have achieved great heights, though it’s a left side movement. With the left side movement, they have achieved great heights. I don’t know how the bhakti [devotion] and śhraddhā [enlightened complete faith] has helped them so much."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"By worshiping the Goddess as the Protector of the whole Universe, praising Her different attributes, even Her Face, Her Hands, everything has a meaning.<br>
Praising Her Powers.<br> 
By saying that, by repeating that, you echo in your projection Her Powers, and then your projection becomes that powerful.<br> 
It’s a very subtle happening that takes place, it’s miraculous.<br>
These things look so simple, like just like washing My Feet. Simple thing is washing My Feet.<br>
Now see these Feet, I don’t know if you see, the whole Universe I see there and I really get stunned by them."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So you should become sat guṇī. In sat guṇa, the highest quality is, Śhaṅkarāchārya, Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya was asked, “Which is the greatest quality?” He said “Devī Bhakti, Mother’s Bhakti.” <b>She is Devī your Mother is the Devī. Understanding that you should do Her bhakti. In that bhakti, there should not be any falsehood.</b> The first quality, the highest quality, if it is seen in a human being from his heart, all his bad qualities will be destroyed, he will get light and attain Mokṣha [liberation]. That is why Śhaṅkarāchārya has always praised the Devī. In the beginning, He has described a lot, written lots of books like Vivekachūḍāmaṇi, etc. Lastly, He said that, “By only pleasing the Devī one can get everything, then why do these things? Why to do debates? Why to do discourses and break one’s head? <b>Just praise the Devī and you will get whatever one wants.</b>"</font><br>

But first make your attention steady.<br>

We worship our Divine Mother in the form of Devī Kāḷarātri, the Goddess of the dark night of dissolution. She is the source of eternal joy and bestower of devotion. The Goddess whose fierce radiance destroys all the demonic forces. She is the master of the art of the war. She has magnificent long dark hair and dark complexion. She decorates Her forehead with red kumkum and shines with the luster of million moons.
