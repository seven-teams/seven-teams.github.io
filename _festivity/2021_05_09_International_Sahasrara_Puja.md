<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Sahastrār, the word sahastr, in Sanskrit language means one thousand. And there are one thousand petals in our brain which get enlightened.</b> Of course, the doctors are quarreling on that point but forget about them.<br>
Now, these petals are kept ready for our enlightenment, and these are really the nerves, one thousand nerves which are there for the enlightenment of the brain. So, when the Kuṇḍalinī rises, She enlightens those one thousand nerves which become like a, as you see here, the shape of these flames, like a petal.<br>
And that’s why it is called as Sahastrāra."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, it’s a great day because Sahasrāra Day and Mother’s Day have come together. It’s a very Sahaj happening, I think, and that is what we have to understand, how Sahasrāra and the motherhood go together.</b><br>
Sahasrāra was definitely opened and Mother had to do it, because formerly those people who came on this Earth tried to teach people about dharma, to bring them to the central path, to the straightforward path of ascent. They tried everything, whatever way They thought was good for a particular community, particular area, particular country. They talked about it and lots of books came out of it, but instead of all these books creating people of religious, spiritual and a united nature, created people who were all against each other."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Śhrī Mātājī: Today is a unique combination of Mother’s Day in many countries and Sahasrār Day for Sahaj Yogis. I think this is the most important day in the history of human evolution</b> because all other events, Incarnations and ventures in the spiritual atmosphere have been of no avail. On the contrary, they have gone into a kind of a cocoon which has no door, banging themselves against the walls, creating problems out of something very auspicious and extremely, beautifully spiritual.<br>
Is not possible to find faults with the Incarnations in whose names all the religions came in. But this cocoon is the Mahāmāyā, I think, cocoon is the one which is ignorance. We can say that Māyā ... Mahāmāyā does not create it. This cocoon is created by the basic ignorance of human beings and their misidentifications."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So, opening Sahasrāra was the most important part of the evolutionary process.</b> All the evolution process brought human beings to what level? We had wars, we had all kinds of silly programs by which we really ruined the so many countries, so many people.<br>
Now, when you are one with that All-pervading Power – it’s a pure power, it’s a nirmal power, absolutely pure power – that gives you complete sense and complete understanding as to how you should move, how you should live and what you should have. This is what is Self-realization, they say."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So the essence of all the religions, of all the Prophets, of all the Incarnations is compassion and is placed in this chakra of heart. Thus we understand that in the second era, now, we have to have compassion. Is the manifestation now of the compassion.<br>
If God Almighty had no compassion, He would not have created this great Universe. Actually, His Power, or the Ādi Śhakti, is the Embodiment of His Compassion. And this compassion has brought forth all the evolution to human level, and even your emancipation as Sahaja Yogis.<br>
And compassion is always completely covered with forgiveness.<br>
<b>So you can see, the Trinity meets at this point. The Son of God is forgiveness, is the Embodiment of Forgiveness. So, the God Almighty who is the Witness, the Mother who is the Compassion and the Child who is the Forgiveness, all of them meet at Heart chakra, in the Sahasrāra.</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So it’s a very great day because collectively this Sahasrāra has been opened. Every one of you have got it. Also all over the world, you have many people who have got their Sahasrāras open. Of course, we need many more for them to understand what is this great event of such a collective opening of Sahasrāra.</b><br>
Some have grown very much, after getting their Realization, very much. They have understood Sahaja Yoga very well, and they have developed their depth, and their consciousness is really a great awareness of Oneness with the Divine.<br>
To be one with the Divine is the greatest blessing for human beings. So far, they were human beings at a lower level of existence. They had all the problems of that level – is that jealousies, hatred; all kinds of problems that are today, of fighting, of troubling others, destroying others and not loving others. All these problems existed because their Sahasrāra was not opened.<br>
...... in Sahaja Yoga so many people have come whose Sahasrāra was completely opened and they felt their depth. Firstly you must feel your depth. If you don’t feel your depth, and you are not one with your personality which is so deep, then you cannot enjoy the Self-realization.<br>
First of all, you should understand yourself. If you don’t understand yourself, how can you understand other people. You cannot. So first this Sahasrāra should be opened out fully. Fully means complete Oneness with the Divine. That is not difficult. Only you have to meditate a little bit and then it will work out. It has worked out in many people I am very happy to see, and meet such people in Sahaja Yoga, who have achieved such a lot of collectivity and also the awareness of a realized Soul."</font><br>
