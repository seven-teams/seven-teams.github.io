<font color="DarkRed">"Today's day. It's nice today it's Mother's Day, and You find so many people waiting for You. 

And also You see Yourself as a Mother, the heart which is pining to meet, then You can't get out of some things. And then You enjoy that pining, that longing to see Your own, Your own children whom You love so much. Is such a great joy.<br>
In these modern times, it is described that in this Kali Yuga everything will go upside down because people will not recognize the motherhood. The mothers won't be respected and won't be respectable either. Is a fact.<br>
And imagine now this has brought this Mother's Day to this country. It's something, such a recognition from the Divine that one has to remember that motherhood is very important.<br>
......<br>
<b>So the power that your Mother has, of giving birth, the spiritual birth, be bestowed upon all of you so that you do this work with the same grace and with the same patience and love and enjoyment.<br>
May God bless you.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="MediumVioletRed"><b>Thank You</b> for descending from Your heavenly abode, Mātā Dvīpa, to bring light into the darkness of Kali Yuga.<br> 
<b>Thank You</b>, Śhrī Mātājī, again and again.<br>
<b>Thank You</b> for delivering Sahaja Yoga to a confused and self-destructive humanity.<br>
<b>Thank You</b> for revealing the meaning of creation and evolution to us.<br>
<b>Thank You</b> for revealing the actual existence of God to us.<br>
<b>Thank You</b> for giving divine meaning to human existence.<br>
<b>Thank You</b> for revealing the reflection of the Viśhwarūpa within the human body to us.</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today is ... I like the day when it is the Mother's, I should say, Mother's Day also. Because I think only a Mother can work it out that way. One has to have a lot of patience with people.<br>
......<br>
But mother's position is different. She'll go on struggling and fighting for her child. She'll fight it out to the last to see that the child gets all the benefits and this patience and this love and this forgiveness is innately built in in a mother, because her attitude is very different. Not any achievement, not any big name or what you call a sort of an award or anything. It is just she does it because she is a mother. And that is what is the sign of any mother, if she is a real mother, at least for her own children, she will go all out, she will work out everything for day in day out and to save the child from disaster. But Sahaja Yoga is a much bigger family and for that you really had to be worked out through the Mother's Principle. You cannot take any other principle.<br>
......<br>
So, in your own way, when you are doing Sahaja Yoga, there also you have to be a mother. <b>More mother's quality than the father's quality, that there's no ambition, there's no competition, there's no jealousies, nothing.</b> Just you want your children to come up and to grow into their spirituality. If that is the only attitude we have then you'll be amazed how satisfied you'll feel, because this is a very, very joy-giving thing, to see people growing in spirituality. Not only talking about it, not only reading about it, but actually happening, actualizing within yourself. So this quality is very helpful and that really helps every Sahaja Yogi to be patient, to be kind, to be humble."</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkGreen"><b>The most beautiful word on the lips of mankind is the word "Mother," and the most beautiful call is the call of "My mother."<br>
It is a word full of hope and love, a sweet and kind word coming from the depths of the heart.</b><br>
(Kahlil Gibran)</font>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"[Mother's is] a very special institution ...... especially in this country [Italy], they have such respect for their mothers.<br>
<b>Mother is the Source of Love.</b> In the Qur'ān they asked Muhammad Sāhab whom should we bow after Allah? So He said "to Mother" -- "to the Mother."<br>
Then again they asked Him, He said: "Only the Mother." Again they asked Him, He said: "Only the Mother."<br>
I'm sure He must have said about the Divine Mother, because worldly mothers may not be complete mothers, perhaps. They are a[n] embodied, or, we can say, examples of Mother's Love, of the Divine Mother's Love, but they are human.<br>
So they can be conditioned, influenced or could be egoistical, especially if they are living in a particular country for a long time and have no idea of Divine Love.<br>
<b>In Divine Love there is no expectations, it just flows, it doesn't think how to judge a person or what to do for a person, it just flows.</b>"</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkGreen"><b>The Mother is everything</b> — She is our consolation in sorrow, our hope in misery and our strength in weakness.<br>
She is the source of love, mercy, sympathy, and forgiveness. And this Earth is the Mother of the trees and flowers.<br>
It produces them, nurses them, and weans them.<br>
The trees and flowers become kind mothers of their great fruits and seeds.<br>
And the Mother, the prototype of all existence, is the Eternal<br>
Spirit, full of beauty and love. </font><br>
