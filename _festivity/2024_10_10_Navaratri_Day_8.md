<font color="DarkRed">"Today, we have gathered here to do the Devī Pūjā.<br>
<b>This Pūjā was performed many a times and the Devī was requested by the Devas to save them from the tyranny of devilish people.</b> Today I feel the same way, that we are now in the grip of a funny situation; that there are people who are themselves devils, I think, -- and also [who are] mesmerized by them -- who are trying to do something which they should never have done. But they don't know that there is a climax of everything. And that point has arrived where all the good people, especially the Sahaja Yogis should put all their mind to the destruction of these horrible personalities like Mahiṣhāsura.<br>
In those days, it was very simple because devils came as devils and you could see them, that they are devils, and all their behavior proved that they were devils. Why they did it? Why were they cruel? Because so-called 'human beings' as they are -- they are not -- they are by nature devilish and they want to do something by which they can destroy human beings, and good human beings. <b>It is evident that the time has come for them to be destroyed.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is the eighth day of Navarātri, but it is great day for Sahaja Yogis because it is the most important period.</b> That is, the seventh center we have crossed and we are on the eighth center. We need not think of the Goddess what She did on the eighth day, we have to think today what we have to do within ourselves.<br>
After crossing the seventh day, after crossing the seventh chakra -- that is the real ascent in your spiritual ascent. What are we to do on the eighth one?<br>
It's so Sahaja that today should be Aṣhṭamī, because that is the day the Goddess killed so may evil doers, and demons and rākṣhasas. She did it on Her own, alone. Now these evil forces are manifesting in human beings. They have spread out. They are within us. So we all have to fight those forces within us. The war is within ourselves, is not without. First when you ascend the seventh chakra, when you are on the eighth step, you have to remember first you have to fight those forces within ourselves."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"And on an Aṣhṭamī, that is today, is the eighth day of the Moon, of the Moon which is increasing, Śhuklapakṣhi, that first time all the weapons of the Goddess are to be worshiped. This was a great idea because these weapons who work all the time, not only to kill the evil but to protect the good, were never worshiped before.</b>"</font><br>

Salutations always to Her who is ever auspicious.<br>

Salutations to Gauri, the supporter of the universe.<br>
Salutations only to Her who is of the form of the moon and moonlight, and happiness itself.<br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So the second thing is, [which] today we do, is a very great <b>Pūjā of Aṣhṭamī [eighth day]: is the day when the Goddess killed nine rākṣhasas together with Her eight hands. So today is a very special day for which a very special attention is needed.</b><br>
It's only at the behest of the bhaktas that the Goddess took Her form and killed all these rākṣhasas.<br>
Also with Her eight hands, She killed Mahiṣhāsura. That's why She's called as Mahiṣhāsuramardinī.<br>
She's called as Nava Chaṇḍī, one who has killed nine chaṇḍas, means nine rākṣhasas She has killed.<br>
So is a very important day and very vital and very deep."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today to see you on this Navarātri Day, so many people sitting to worship Me. So many people are here, so many Sahaja Yogis, it's so remarkable, it is not My achievement, I tell you. It's your seeking. Because I have been on this Earth many a times before -- that you know. But we never had like this, so many came and got crucified, died, this, that -- but I never had people of this caliber.<br>
So again we come to the same point, that we should be aware of ourselves -- complete śhraddhā in your Self. If you have some śhraddhā in your Self, you will have śhraddhā for Me also.<br>
......<br>
....... I will say that on this day, what we have to do is to kill the devils within ourselves, that's all. If you want to really worship Me, that's what you have to think, what are the devils within you, that's all. So you don't have to worry otherwise for outside devils, they cannot do anything to you.<br>
May God bless you."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"You have to see that all the negativity goes away, around us, around the universe.<br>
<b>So first we sing the praise of the Goddess; when She destroyed every negative, satanic incarnation of Mahiṣhāsura.</b><br> 
And when he was killed, all the Gods praised Her for saving them from the ... from the destruction, and that happened long, long time back -- it was ten thousand years back. So this is the praise of the Gods of that so that, whatever is the negativity, through those mantras will go away, because it surrounds us -- you see that, all of them have been there coming; from ten thousand years they have been coming. But this is the way you can throw them out of the present into their proper places."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"...... <b>Navarātri is very good because these nine nights represent the main Nine Incarnations</b>. Where the Goddess took the form of Śhakti and killed the negative people.<br>
But those were easier days because negativity was understood by people and nobody sympathized.<br>
So this is what one has to understand that don't sympathize with negativity. You'll spoil them all. And always you'll find such sympathies bring forth your character also that you are also slightly negative.<br>
Because to fight negativity in modern times is a very difficult task. You cannot kill anyone: if you kill somebody, then may be that such a person is a brother or a sister or something of somebody. Or such a person would be himself or herself a seeker.<br>
So best thing is to separate like a contagious disease, keep that person out, no sympathies. And get the person cured and enjoy the life, otherwise that person is not going to be helped. It has become a very individual fight. And it's so troublesome and so disgusting.<br>
So to help Me out, you should not take any sides with negativity. That's how you can help Me the most. <b>This is what it is the Navarātri, the Pūjā that I give you powers to fight the negativity. That's how you cure people.</b>"</font><br>
