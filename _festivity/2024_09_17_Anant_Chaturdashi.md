<font color="DarkRed">"So, before creating this Creation, before creating the Ādi Kuṇḍalinī, before creating this universe, <b>Śhrī Gaṇeśha was established. Today, being Tuesday, is an auspicious day.</b> He is in reality the Incarnation of Purity. He resides within us but you don't have the eyes to see Him. In the center called Mūlādhāra which is surrounded by the prostate gland [in men] and which is called as pelvic plexus, He is reflected within every person. He might be asleep but He resides there. This Deity is such that He never falls asleep completely. When a person becomes a complete devil, then He disappears from there but He is present within everyone. This is the first center within us which is called as Mūlādhāra chakra."</font><br>

<b> You are the One to be worshipped first. Obeisance to You again and again.<br>
You are the Word that was in the beginning. You are the Aumkara.<br>
You are the source of life. You are the source of security.</b>

Sahaja Yogi: Today it’s said it’s Anant Chaturdaśhī.<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b> Ah?</font><br>
Sahaja Yogi: Anant Chaturdaśhī.<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b> Today? Ah-ah! That’s great! Yes must be. I was wondering Anant Chaturdaśhī. <b>Anant Chaturdaśhī is the day when we visarjan – dissolve Śhrī Gaṇeśha in the water.</b><br>
Gaṇeśhjī ko chodte hai na pani mein – it’s that day we put the Gaṇeśha in to the water.<br>
Because <b>He’s established for ten days and after ten days</b>, He’s born on the fourth, after ten days He’s dissolved in the water so that everywhere His Power is spread through the water.<br>
That’s why no wonder there was a Pūjā.<br>
Gaṇeśha settled down into the water. That is Ananta Chaturdaśhī. Ananta is the, is Śhrī Gaṇeśha.<br>
Ananta means which cannot be destroyed. Innocence cannot be destroyed. And that is why is the Gaṇeśh Chaturdaśhī means the day when Gaṇeśha is dissolved in the water, in the ocean or He is created, worshiped for ten days and again given back. So it’s a very great day today, I should say, like the Resurrection of Christ that you are, you had Christ here, He lived with you, and then went back to His Father. Father is the ocean and that’s what in India they do, <b>establish Him on the fourth day and on the tenth day they put Him back to the ocean</b>."</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Establish Śhrī Gaṇeśha within you.</b> First of all you must establish Him and then you can use it for others, for yourself and for bettering and bettering the methods of Sahaja Yoga that you have learnt.<br>
That's how Śhrī Gaṇeśha is so important for all the Sahaja Yogis to be understood in all its aspects, but this principle is very enormous I should say. The principle is very spread out, it's very subtle, so to understand in all its aspects is not an easy thing. The only thing you can do is to become One with it, like the Ocean. If you become One with the Ocean you become the Ocean. Just become One with it and that's how it works out."</font><br>

<p style=" text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Only in your Āratī, in Marathi</b>, of Śhrī Gaṇeśha, they say that, “At the time when I am getting my Realization you must save me.” That’s the only thing they ask, "At the time of my Resurrection you must save me." It does not say that, 'At the time of my Resurrection you protect me,' no! "You save me."<br>
Because He’s the one who is sitting on every chakra like a vice-chancellor of the university.<br>
Even if you have Viṣhṇu on your side, Mahādeva on your side, but if Śhrī Gaṇeśha is there sitting and He says, ‘No, not his ascent,’ it doesn’t work out, it’s very difficult."</font><br>
