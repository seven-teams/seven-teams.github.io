<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is the day of Guru Pūrṇimā. It is a Full Moon Day. That's why ... it is called as Pūrṇimā. The guru has to be like a Full Moon. Means completely grown, completely matured.</b><br>
There are sixteen kalās or the phases of the Moon, and when the complete Pūrṇimā comes in, the Full Moon Day, all the sixteen kalās are completed. You also know that in the Viśhuddhi chakra there are sixteen sub-plexuses. When Kṛiṣhṇa is described as Virāṭa, He's called as the Sampūrṇa, the Complete Incarnation of Viṣhṇu's aspect, because He's got the sixteen phases completely done.<br>
So today's number is sixteen. Six plus one: seven.<br>
Now we have to understand the importance of guru. Why should we have a guru when we have God? We've got Śhakti, then why should we have a guru? What is the need to have a guru?<br>
Guru means the weight, the weight. We get our weight from the magnetic forces of the gravity of the Mother Earth. So, guru means gravity: the gravity in a person.<br>
Why do we need a guru?<br>
Because to know God is easy, specially in Sahaja Yoga, to be one with Him. As soon as you get your Self-realization in Sahaja Yoga, the modern Sahaja Yoga, immediately you become entitled to give Realizations to other people.<br>
It was said that, "Guru is the person who makes you meet the Divine." But's not true. Because any self-realized person, in the Sahaja Yoga, can raise the Kuṇḍalinī and king ... can give Self-realization to others, immediately after they have touched the Sahasrāra or opened the Sahasrāra. But normally a realized Soul cannot do it. Any born realized Soul cannot do it on its own: it has to have authority of Me, as I am today.<br>
That's why <b>it was said that, "Guru is a person who makes you meet God": he raises the Kuṇḍalinī and makes you one with God.</b><br>
Because in those days when the gurus were self-realized, ...... when the gurus were self-real... -realized, they had the authority and power of raising the Kuṇḍalinī only after they had reached a very great state of evolution: complete purification, complete detachment."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Today we have all gathered here for worshiping your Guru.<br>
As you know that the Principle of Guru resides in the Void. This is the Principle which gives you balance, which gives you the gravity.</b> The gravity that we have in the Mother Earth is expressed through your Guru Principle.<br>
The first point of gravity is that you should have a personality, a character and the temperament that people would see that you are a personality who doesn't get dissolved into worldly things. Is a personality which doesn't get ruined by the skirmishes of life. Is the personality of a guru which sits down deep into his ... into his being and is not easily disturbed or dissolved by any solvent whatsoever.<br>
<b>This is the first Principle of the Guru, is the gravity.</b><br> 
As I told you, it is something which cannot be dissolved into anything, it settles very deep down into your personality."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today is a day people's ... this is created by human beings and not by God, as Guru Pūrṇimā. Because as God has created days of Their advent, human beings have created days of their surrendering. So this is the day when you have to give something to the Guru, and Guru does not have to give anything to you. This is the time you have to say: 'What you are going to give? What you are going to do for your Guru?' Because so far the Guru has been giving.<br>
If you are in meditation, supposing you say, 'We'll meditate because Guru Pūrṇimā is there,' that's not the way the Guru Pūrṇimā is to be celebrated. Because if you meditate, you are taking from Me. If you try to correct yourself, you are taking from Me. If you are going to get cured, you are taking from Me.<br>
So now what can you do for Me? Is the point, you have to think about it. 'What can you do?'<br>
Now I have sent the same question to India, to find ... I asked them to find out: 'What can you do for Me?'<br>
You will say: 'Mother, what can we do? After all, what are we?' That's a way of evading the issue.<br>
But if you really want to see, <b>you can do a lot. And that is what it is that: you are My witness. You are My publicity!</b><br>
So, today you have to take some vows. And you have to say: that, 'We are going to do these things. We are going to talk about Sahaj Yog, we are going to propagate it, we are going to spread it. And what may come, we are going to surrender ourselves to Mother. Even, if She's supposing, scolds us, or says anything it is for our good. And we are not going to get confused.' And that's how you have to absolutely vow that you are going to dedicate yourself to Sahaj Yog to help others, to e... emancipate, and to create atmosphere for the completion of this universe, of this creation, for that fruitful day when we will say: that the Kingdom of God has been brought on this Earth.<br>
So today is not the day for Me to give, but for you. You have to announce."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"Uh in the most auspicious time, that is called as Kṛita Yuga, we all have assembled here to understand the ways and methods of establishing our Principle of a Master. ......<br>
<b>Kṛutan Yuga means the time when you have to do something: kṛita, 'when it was done'.<br>
So, you are the channels of that doing: doing the work of God. You are the channels of God Almighty and His Power. On one side, you have to carry the dignity, the glory, and the assumption that you are a guru, on the other side, you have to be completely surrendered to your God Almighty.</b> All your dignity, your authority comes from Him. And the third thing is: that the way He has created this Universe and you, in a mood of play, you have to see His Play. So, a kind of mood that is cheerfulness should be really bubbling through you."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>On the day of Guru Pūrṇimā, that in this life I have become a Guru. I had not done this type of work in any other lifetime.</b> It is the first time that I have done the work of the Guru. Maybe it is because the Mother has to be the Guru. This is a matter of the Kali Yuga. That is why the tremendous Śhakti of the Divine which must flow from the heart of a Mother, and by Her Grace and compassion the Kuṇḍalinī should be treasured and It should be taken to that top where She in Her glory, Her joy, and Her splendor be seated, and perhaps that is in My destiny. That is why in this birth this position of the Guru has been created. <b>If the Mother becomes the Guru, it is a very difficult, as a mother is very tender.</b> A male guru will beat up, hit or even scold but for a mother when she utters even one harsh word her heart bleeds and pains a lot. When she sees that her children have come through such difficulties, and how she has to gather them with love and care and take them across, that her responsibility grows so much that her entire character changes. <b>But from ancient times it has been known that no one is greater than the mother as a guru. Only make such a one your guru who is greater than you, the one who is greater than you is God.</b><br>
It was said about Guru Rāmadās Swāmī that make only such a person your guru who himself is Paras [touchstone], and who just by touching others does not make them into gold but makes them elixir [touchstone]. He makes others like himself.<br>
That is how the form of the mother is. A mother lives for her children. Lives in the glory of her children.<br>
That is why perhaps in this lifetime the Divine wanted this that this love and this knowledge should come through a Mother."</font><br>
