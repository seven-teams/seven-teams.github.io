<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is the first day of Navarātri. Today your attention should be on Śhrī Gaṇeśha.</b> His devotion is infinite.<br>
He has never worshiped anybody else except Mother. Hence He is so great. All other Gods appear very strong. Everyone has some specialty. What is Mother’s specialty? Her ego (aham) is nowhere felt by others. Hence Śhrī Gaṇeśha who has surrendered to such Mother is so wise and venerable, Mother has nothing with Her. Her very name begins with Ni, e.g., Niṣhakāñchan[ā] having no wealth, Nirlepā unaffected; Nirvichārā thoughtless; Niṣhprayojanā having no motives, Nigarvitā egoless, Niricchā desireless, etc. Therefore, surrendering to such Mother, who has nothing with Her, needs some kind of subtle thought, in that, Mother has nothing with Her, and therefore, nothing can be asked from Her. It shows how Śhrī Gaṇeśha by himself is fully satisfied. Where does this contentment of Śhrī Gaṇeśha come from? It is own power."</font><br>

<font color="red">"Today we worship the Himalayas and the seven Goddesses whose blessings are here and pray to them to bless us with Devī Śhakti.<br>
We have received the blessings of the Devī Śhakti from a Mother.<br>
That is why, in the form of Mother, let us come to the feet (śharaṇāgat) of the Himalayas.<br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"And even that there was Military, and there were jeeps passing when I was coming, they saw Me, they had to salute. And the gentleman in charge of the command, he came down, three times, just to see Me. He saw Me off at the station, I mean, all ... as if all of them knew. And they were singing the song, <b>'You, the person that belongs to our hills.' 'Paharoṃwālī Śheroṃwālī', the one who is of the tigress, the one who is the daughter of the mountains.<br>
The first name of the Goddess is Śhailaputrī, as you know, that Śhailaputrī means the daughter of the mountains. So to them, I was just their own.</b> They were waiting for Me, they knew, I was to come, I came -- they got it. So that's the good conditioning. You are conditioned the other way, never recognize anyone."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Mahākālī Power, first of all, gave birth only to Śhrī Gaṇeśha. Then Śhrī Gaṇeśha was established.</b><br>
Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the Deity established first of all.<br>
So is the case of Śhrī Gaṇeśha, like Mahākālī it is the Seed and the whole universe emerged out of it and again get merged into it, similarly, everything emerges out of Gaṇeśha Principle and gets merged into it.<br>
Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the seed of whatever is there, you see through your eyes, in creation, in desire.<br>
<b>That is why Śhrī Gaṇeśha is considered first among Deities.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>On this auspicious occasion God Almighty has manifested all His śhaktis for your protection, benevolence and welfare. In everything God is blessing you.</b> He wants to see you enter His Kingdom. In a way it is His Desire that you should return to your Father's home and enjoy its comforts. But at least we should be worthy of it. If we are not worthy of it then how can we enter it? We should examine our worthiness and see what it is.<br>
The first thing is that you should come to your Father's house. Today I have also come to My Father's house. I feel like that because Himalaya is My Father. On coming here, I cannot express in words the feelings that are rising within Me, but I think that today I have found a great occasion to celebrate the glory of My Father. A great opportunity has come before Me to praise the glories of My Father and narrate the great achievements of those who meditated here. With the inspiration derived [received] from the Himalayas they rose from nowhere to such heights that they achieved the highest state.<br>
The Himalayas are the Sahasrāra that Mother Earth has created for you. This Sahasrāra is to be worshiped. This Sahasrāra is very great. I don't know if you can see vibrations emitting from it. I am completely engulfed by their vibrations that I cannot see anything else. There are only vibrations and vibrations. Nothing else."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>On this day Devī is worshiped as Śhailaputrī, means the daughter of Himalaya.</b> Devī has many other names also but first of all She incarnated as Śhailaputrī in the cold of Himalayas. She incarnated and whatever She was to do. She started there. Further story is known to you. [King] Dakṣha did not invite Lord Śhiva in the Havana that he performed and Śhailaputrī was the consort of Lord Śhiva. She is called Satī because She entered the Holy fire of Havana and ablated Herself. But by then Lord Śhiva reached there. He lifted her burnt up body from the fire. Burnt pieces of the body of Śhailaputrī fell at many places. All these places are considered to be Śhakti Pīṭhas, the places of worship, as there is in Vindhyāchala and many other places. Her power moves there and it is said that it Sanctifies everything. Her seventh power is considered to be the Power of Destruction. Śhakti manifested Itself on the right side as Sāvitrī and Gāyatrī but the destroying force was manifested in the center. In the form of Durgā and Her other forms manifested in Heart chakra. She is present there. If someone hurts you, confuses or disturbs you then this power will protect you and destroy your enemy."</font><br>
