<font color="DarkRed">"<b>The right one is the Mahāsaraswatī Power. This one gives you the right sympathetic nervous system.</b><br>
The central one is the Suṣhumṇā. This is the path of our evolution. Throughout we have evolved through this path of the Suṣhumṇā, where you ascend up to the Sahasrāra, and when you cross that, then you become a realized Soul. This is called as the Mahālakṣhmī's Power.<br>
Mahākālī, Mahāsaraswatī and Mahālakṣhmī, and three of Them put together in the brain, then become the Ādi Śhakti, the Primordial Mother. And that also we call it as the Ādi Śhakti's Seat, that is above your head."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we have the idea to do Saraswatī’s Pūjā.</b><br>
[<font color="orange">unclear</font>] I have seen that here people worship Mahākālī and Saraswatī, people worship Devī and people are simple natured.<br>
We should worship Saraswatī as well.<br>
Saraswatī’s work is very great. First, Mahāsaraswatī created the entire universe.<br>
The earth element is special in this. The earth element has been placed in such a way between the Sun and the Moon that any living work can easily happen on it.<br>
From this living work, slowly and gradually human beings have been generated.<br>
But we should know our own great power.<br>
That power is what we call creation power, it’s also called creativity.<br>
This creation power is the blessing of Saraswatī by which many arts have been generated. The evolution of art is due to the blessings of Saraswatī."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Hiraṇyagarbha (Prajāpati) is the creator aspect of God Almighty. It acts in the stomach of the Primordial Being which is a Void, also referred to as the Ocean of Illusion (Bhavasāgara). (The way this Void was created is covered later.) <b>Hiraṇyagarbha’s Power incarnates as Mahāsaraswatī, and the entire material creation is the product of Her power and activity:</b> She created all the galaxies, stars, and planets including our own Sun, Moon, and Earth. She also functions as the thinking power of the Primordial Being, and this process generates the Cosmic Ego (Ādi Ahaṅkāra). The channel carrying this power is the Ādi Piṅgalā Nāḍī, and it expresses the Primordial Preconscious Mind (Ādi Chitta). It acts like a postman who carries messages to the intellect of the Almighty."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Mahāsaraswatī Principle is on the right side as I’d ... you all know. First is the Brahmadeva’s Principle, which is the Saraswatī Principle, and then this Mahāsaraswatī takes you to the Principle of Mahābrahmadeva called as Hiraṇyagarbha.<br>
Now, <b>this Hiraṇyagarbha Principle is very important for Sahaja Yogis</b>."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"But ... <b>the Power of Saraswatī becomes Mahāsaraswatī when It is manifested by the Mahābrahmadeva, which is called as Hiraṇyagarbha.</b> For that She has to cross through the Haṃsa. She crosses through Haṃsa and becomes the Viṣhṇumāyā Śhakti. I mean, She ... <b>She is the Viṣhṇumāyā Śhakti. So Saraswatī becomes the Viṣhṇumāyā. She crosses at two points: one at Haṃsa and another at Viśhuddhi. So, She is the sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br>
So Saraswatī was born as the sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"The second power, which He gave us, which He sent to us, was Mahāsaraswatī and to this Mahāsaraswatī Power, <b>He called Counselor, the one who will counsel you – that means, who helps us for Yoganirūpaṇ [to see the form of Yoga]</b>.<br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Only the Sahaja Yogis, those who are enlightened people, can worship Mahāsaraswatī. Otherwise, people can only worship Saraswatī because with worship of Saraswatī you can read books, you can create dances, music, for the amusement of human beings, but actually the Saraswatī Pūjā is meant for people of ordinary awareness, means ordinary or normal human awareness. But for Sahaja Yogis, it is the Mahāsaraswatī which is to be worshiped."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So today’s Pūjā is going to be especially for you all to develop that creativity of talking, behaving in every way in a fiery way.</b> That is going to put them right, nothing else.<br>
In creative work also when we create something or we sing something and all that, if you go on singing say in our Indian style, some music which is [unclear] very slow tālas, that won’t go.<br>
...... So this is My understanding of today’s happening that in this natural surrounding, these natural surroundings where we are blessed by the work of Brahmadeva and Saraswatī, and where we can feel the capacity of these Deities, to what extent They can create. The nature is absolutely one with the Divine.<br>
...... <b>Just like the nature is one with Me, you are also one with Me. And that will should start happening when you will really become absolutely drawn into Sahaja Yoga, surrendered into Sahaja Yoga. Then only it will happen.</b><br>
May God bless you."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"And then is in the left hand She has a book, so She – that means that the Power of Saraswatī gives you the full creativity by which you can create books. That also means that, but must have in the books means that whatever you’re doing now – supposing you’re doing Sahaja Yoga, Sahaja Yoga is say concerning the Divine. So we must know what are in the books, means in the Scriptures. We must know how it relates to the Scriptures like it should not be something just coming like a mushroom knowledge, but it should be related to the books, means which is already written down, which is already being typed, being printed.<br>
But that doesn’t mean that it is a bookish knowledge, but it is whatever you have found out, whatever you have discovered has to be related to the books. And that is the Power She gives us, that She relates.<br>
Like when you must have read many books where there are quotations, even I use many quotations, and I give you now this all this knowledge is already part of it, I should say not the all, but part of it from the books in the sense it is written about Saraswatī and everything.<br>
So <b>one must learn how to respect the books, specially the Scriptures.<br>
And She’s the One Who gives you the penetration power into these books: to know what is the truth and what is not, penetration power to understand what is written between the lines, what is the subtle meaning of the whole thing, that is the Power of Saraswatī</b>."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"In school, our kids are absorbing knowledge. But we should be careful that without Self-realization whatever knowledge you get will be impure knowledge. Without Self-realization, whether you study science or economics, you will neither understand it completely nor you will be able to bring it in your creation power.<br>
Kids are of two types: one loves studying and the other don’t enjoy studying. Some kids have less brain and others have more.<br>
<b>Brain is also the gift of Saraswatī but the Ātmā gives us wisdom. Whatever knowledge you get from your brains, until you weigh it on your wisdom, then that knowledge becomes harmful.</b><br>
...... <b>With the realization of the Ātmā, itself, the brain gets the incandescent of Śhrī Saraswatī</b>, and even the children who are weak in reading and writing start doing good work. After this, the growth of art begins.<br>
If one wants to develop art without Self-realization the art is not treated with respect [is unrecognized] and there is no name or sign of it and is eventually lost.<br>
So, <b>first of all, getting the Self-realization and then doing Saraswatī Pūjā is in itself a great thing</b>."</font><br>
