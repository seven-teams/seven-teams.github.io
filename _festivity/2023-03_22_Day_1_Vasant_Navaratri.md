<font color="DarkRed">"<b>In India, Navarātri falls twice in a year. Once it is in the month of Chaitra as it is today.</b> On this day Devī is worshiped as Śhailaputrī, means the daughter of Himalaya. Devī has many other names also but first of all She incarnated as Śhailaputrī in the cold of Himalayas. She incarnated and whatever She was to do. She started there.<br>
..When Kuṇḍalinī rises and reaches the Heart chakra then it manifests and becomes more powerful and effective because Kuṇḍalinī is Jagadambā. In Sahaja Yoga, when Kuṇḍalinī is awakened it, settles in Heart chakra. It protects you and takes care of you nicely.<br>
No one could harm you at all if you keep the Mother in your heart. The power of the mother always protects the children. Whenever there is some danger, it is mentioned in medical terminology that the sternum bone starts shaking and antibodies that are present all around get alarmed. In Sahaja language, these antibodies are called gaṇas. They get ready to fight it out. She is the empress of these gaṇas. They follow her commands as there is no difference between Śhrī Gaṇeśha and Devī. Both are so identified.<br>
Gaṇeśha is Her Son and She is His Mother. In Sahaja Yoga, She protects all those who have awakened Śhrī Gaṇeśha in themselves. She protects them just like Her own children at every step. She supports them because She is the Mother and you are the Gaṇeśha. But the Gaṇeśha within you should be fully awakened and pure. If there is obstruction in this chakra, it should be removed."</font><br>

<b>That first day [Guḍhī Pāḍavā] of these nine nights [of Vasanat Navarātri], in this year, will start the manifestation of the New Age.</b><br>
Of course, the New Age has come long time back. But the manifestation did not work out that much. It will start, I’m sure."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Guḍhī Pāḍavā is celebrated in different parts of our country.</b> The way we celebrate it here, it is celebrated in South too. Everywhere this festival is celebrated. The beginning of the Vikrami Saṃvata and that of the Śhālivāhan Śhaka also fall on the same day. Today is that day. All our dates and festivals are decided according to it, particularly our festivals. We follow the Moon calendar whereas foreigners follow the Sun calendar. That is the reason that the dates of their festivals never get changed. But all our festivals depend on the position of the Moon. That is why their dates keep changing and all our festivals are celebrated on different dates."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is new year's day and the beginning of the Moon.</b> That is why this day is given so much significance. It is known as Guḍhī Pāḍavā. A flag is put on a stick and on it is put a small pitcher. This pitcher represents Kuṇḍalinī. It is taken as a symbol. The Śhālivāhanas were the devotees of the Devī [Goddess] and it is told that they used to offer shawl to the Goddess. In the beginning they were called Sāt[a]vāhans because they worshiped Seven Plexuses and this Sāt[a]vāhana was ultimately changed into Śhālivāhana. But the symbol of Śhālivāhana is the same. They put up a ‘guḍhī’ means a flag and a small pitcher is put on it as a symbol. This pitcher has a particular shape which represents Kuṇḍalinī. So they were the worshipers of Kuṇḍalinī and followed it. That is the reason they made this symbol in this way.<br>
All those who follow Kuṇḍalinī put up a guḍhī in their houses and also put a flag on it and thus it is indicated that they welcome Kuṇḍalinī and exhibit it in a special way."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Chaitra is the month.</b> And this is the time when – [Marathi] – <b>Gaurī is the Chaitra</b>. 
So the establishment of the Gaurī is taken place during these nine days.<br>
But Gaṇeśha has to be established before anything else.<br>
Though first Gaurī had to come, you can see that. Gaurī had to come first to establish Gaṇeśha."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Kuṇḍalinī is Gaurī, today is Gaurī Pūjan, Gaurī Pūjan in the month of Chaitra is special.</b> Means before installation of Gaṇapati we have installed Gaurī in the month of Chaitra. Gaurī who created Gaṇapati is the Gaurī from Chaitra and we all believe that.<br>
In the same way our Śhālivāhans have given it so much importance that Guḍhī Pāḍavā starts on the first day of Chaitra month, because Gaurī first is Śhakti, who started the work, to start any work first we worship Gaṇeśha, this is also done by Gaurī.<br>
Gaurī has put Gaṇeśh in the temporal world or universe so that the innocence which Gaṇeśh has should spread in the whole world. And before anyone else, She established Chaitanya in the form of Gaṇeśh for the whole world and spread it everywhere. Then we will do whatever is required but first is the Spirit, the Chaitanya. The world’s Kuṇḍalinī, Mother Gaurī has done this work.<br>
The importance of this day is that this is the beginning, creating Śhrī Gaṇeśh on Her on own, no contribution from Sadāśhiv, She has not yet met Sadāśhiv, so the Virgin Gaurī, She created Gaṇapati from Her Powers, because She is Śhakti Swarūpa, She can do anything. And that Gaṇapati is pure, holy, which is in the form of Chaitanya, was made."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>So this New Year’s Day is the first day of advent of Goddess</b> – the nine days there are.<br> 
..So today is the day to mark absolutely the first day when She incarnated on this Earth.<br>
That’s the day also of the Gaurī, because Virgin is the first form of the Goddess."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>We have known about the importance of this day.</b> Today we have to be determined that we shall meditate and introspect daily. We shall introspect about ourselves, not about others and lead our lives very sweetly. We should express and behave in a very sweet manner so that we do not hurt others. If at all we have to lay emphasis on some thing that should also be done very lovingly. You have to think as to how to speak with others. It’s a routine for Me. Such and such person is coming, how shall I talk to him and make him understand? When we see this love all around, it fills our heart. Exchange this love with others and talk to them sweetly. Sahaja Yogis should not be angry with anyone. Meet people very affectionately. You should be pure within and this purity of heart should be visible. There should be no anger and hatred. Only then people will appreciate you. Now you are all self-realized and I am telling you, how your personality should become magnetic. I hope you follow this advice and look within with love, not with hatred. You will be able to see your powers and you will become a sāttvik [pure] person and Sahaja Yoga will spread all around. It’s My vision that the whole world is transformed and every human being becomes Sahaja Yogi.<br>
My blessing to you all."</font><br>
