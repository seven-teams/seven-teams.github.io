<font color="DarkRed">"Today, at the end of this program at Gāndhī Bhawan, I want to first tell you about Gāndhījī and why Gāndhī Bhawan is so important. Perhaps we have never realized what a tremendous instrument Gāndhījī was.<br>
At the age of seven years he just picked Me up from My family. And I stayed with him very, very close, extremely close.<br>
Gāndhījī used to call Me as Nepālī, that was My name. And everybody knew Me like that's time. After 40 years, or say 45 years or so, suddenly I met Kamalnayan Bajaj [1915-1972, son of Jamnalal Bajaj (1889-1104 to 1942-0211)] in the wedding of his own son. And I went to him and I said, ``Do you recognize Me?" He said, ``What? Nepālī? How are You here?" And just tears started rolling down My eyes. That was Gāndhījī.<br>
He was a tremendous hard taskmaster. And I always used to say that, ``You can be hard with you, but how can you be hard with all those people?" He would make us get up at 4 o'clock. It was very easy for Me to get up at 4 because, you see, My body has no habits: I can get up any time, sleep any time. But I used to feel for others, like [laughing:] he would make [Laughing:] even Maulana Azad get up at 4 o'clock. And they had to clean their utensils, they had to even, the āśhramites had to clean: [laughing:] clean the bathrooms and the lavancy [lavatories], and everything with their own hand. He was a tremendous hard taskmaster, but an extremely loving and compassionate person.<br>
He, as a just now uh Grégoire has said, are definitely he always used to talk to Me in a way as if I was a grandmother, you see? And he used to discuss things with Me, most surprising to all [laughing:] others, in a way, and this, I was a big adviser to everyone. He would make Me sit and he said that: ``Guidance can be had better from such children than from the older people."<br>
Even when I again went to Gāndhī āśhram this time, Madalsa [Narayan Bajaj, another son of Jamnalal Bajaj] then told Me the same thing: ``Do You remember that he used to say so?" I said, ``I remember that."<br>
<b>But, somehow he had recognized Me, I think he knew about Me.<br>
Same I would say about Shastrijī who had recognized Me and who used to really sort of ... That's another man we have not been able to know.</b><br>
I wish there were some people somewhere near their levels. They were people who were absolutely standing on the edges of sorts. They would not tolerate anything that was wrong for themselves. First thing they had was to keep themselves upright in dharma. And Gāndhījī used to really beats himself day to day and ask questions, ``Is it in dharma I am doing? Is it in dharma I am doing? Is it in dharma I am doing?" He was [a] tremendous personality.<br>
And the thing that I have learnt from him, I should say, was one of the things which I could never have understood otherwise: is a sense of public money. Actually. I have no sense of money at all, I am so horrid. I ... I do not know what is bank, and I do not know how to cash a check. I'm still, ido [you know], I mean I have, must have cashed lots of checks but I don't know how to do it. Even today, if they want to teach Me, I just can't learn. I am no good for that. But I have seen Gāndhījī's sense of public money, he was so keev [keen], so clean and so sharp that anybody who has lived with him -- I cannot understand, how can they take to this kind of cheap dealing with public money.<br>
Once we had a meeting of all the big leaders, and the they came to Gāndhī āśhram where we all girls were staying, and some uh boys were there, looking after them, giving them pamphlets and thing[s]. And suddenly Gāndhījī realized that it's very late and they should have their lunch in the āśhram itself. So he said that, ``Why not have your lunch here?" They said, ``All right. If you thinks [think] we will have, all right." So he got up, he always had the bhaṇḍāra [stockpile, store] close with him because Bā [his wife Kasturbai] was not there, so he came down, and he told us that, ``Let us weigh food for them and take it out." So, then we had to weigh according to the number of people who [laughing:] were there. He said, ``I am a bhakta baniyā: you must properly weigh everything and take it out." And then he took about 15 minutes to do all that. Then again he took the piece, [laughing:] put it back and went on with his work. I think it was Maulana Azad or someone, who was there, who said, ``Babu, I never knew that you make ... mill our [unclear] we put [you] to so much trouble for our sakes. We could have gone back little later and have our [unclear]." He said, ``Trouble? What trouble is what?" He said,  ``No! The way you got up, you had to take away. You are so cautious and careful about it!" You know, the words he said, even today to say I feel so much touched. He said:  ``Do you know? This is the blood of my people. I cannot allow it to be wasted or in any way spilled." Just imagine! He said, ``Ye dāne dāne mere baccho ke ghar se āyā" [This generosity (grains) came from my children's home]. I mean, I cannot forget his sense of honesty.</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"And even I have seen Mister Shastri do the same thing.<br>
I mean, there was nothing like a double standard. On the contrary, the closer you get to them, you respected them much more, because they were so cleense [cleanse], have clean. And they thought with that they'd maintain that cleanliness and that standard.<br>
We are really very lucky to have such great people born in this country of ours. Only the trouble is that you have forgotten what great contribution they have done! That <b>Gāndhījī was a person who came on this Earth to save us from this foreign domination, in a such a unique manner.<br>
He laid down the basis for Sahaja Yoga, actually. In every way he laid down. For example, if you see his ideas, economic ideas, are absolutely in tune with Sahaja.</b>"</font><br>

<font size="+0">Dear Brothers and Sisters,<br>
<br>
Today we are celebrating 150 years since the birth of Mahātmā Gāndhī (1869-1948) and 115 years since the birth of Lal Bahadur Shastrijī (1904-1966). Through their honesty, high standards, power of sacrifice, dedication to dharma, people and their country, love, and compassion, they have laid down the basis for Sahaja Yoga. Just remembering them and their ideas and deeds is a moment of great joy and great source of inspiration. All our respect and gratitude to them!</font>
