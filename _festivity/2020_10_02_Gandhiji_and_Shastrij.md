<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Gāndhījī is the man who has created base for dharma in this country of modern times.</b> If you see his Bhajanāwalī [unclear]. You’ll be amazed, it is all based on the different chakras, one after another all that Bhajanāwalī will start from one to another. Is just like how we do it for our Kuṇḍalinī awakening.<br>
It is based one after another, from one chakra to another chakra, to another chakra, to another chakra, though he has not mentioned anything else. Apart from that, we in Sahaja Yoga, we have to take account of all the Incarnations, of all the Prophets, of all the great Primordial Masters, who came on this Earth and adjust accordingly the different movements of the Kuṇḍalinī. Because according so Sahaja Yoga all these Incarnations are within us, and they help us, and we have to awaken them. Same thing Gāndhījī has done, is to tell us that we have to look around, we have to know Bible, we have to know Gītā, we have to know all these great Scriptures and great people, and integrate.<br>
Of course, that part is left to Me, is the actualization of what he wanted to do. Though he definitely had prepared the base economically, then political base also. He never believed in aggression. Never. And he said that sharing should be brought. He always believed even capitalism should be conquered through enlightenment. Though he was so busy with this emergency job of saving the whole nation, that he could not pay much attention to the subtler side of Sahaja Yoga, which I call awakening of the Kuṇḍalinī of Self-realization.<br>
But he always talked of, he always said about it, most surprising, he’s the only one I have seen so far who was not doing Self-realization, but was so close to it and could see clearly that Self-realization is the only way for emancipation of human beings. His values and his styles were so correct."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"India has now won back its democracy and the leaders are talking of Gāndhījī. That is a very big step forwards towards the new style of government. <b>Gāndhījī believed in Love of God. He believed in dharma. He believed in integration.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"My father, mother sacrificed all their lives for the work of Mahātmā Gāndhī, of getting freedom. <b>When I was with Mahātmā Gāndhī he knew about Sahaja Yoga because he was also a realized Soul, but he told Me that just now we are not free people. We have to get our freedom; otherwise, we cannot talk about Sahaja Yoga.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"As you know, I am full of compassion and Mister Srivastava has seen how I used to cry seeing people being starved and in, living in conditions which not even animals can manage. <b>So when I saw Śhrī Lal Bahadur Shastri, I felt now, 'After Gāndhījī, here is a man.'</b> Normally, you’ll be surprised. Most of these people, martyrs, even My father, mother, even Gāndhījī, they never cared for politics, they never wanted to do anything with politics. They said, “We don’t want to do anything,” but here was a man who ventured himself into politics and who was a realized Soul, was a very big combination for Me. And I could see the potential of this.<br>
If you ask Me, I can’t join politics. Shastrijī asked Me several times. He said, “Why don’t You come to politics?” I said, “It’s beyond Me. I just can’t.” And most of them were so much detached. They didn’t want to have election, they didn’t want to do anything of that kind."</font><br>

Mahātmā Gāndhī [to Śhrī Mātājī when She was about 11]: Why don’t You write a poem?<br>	
<font color="DarkGreen"><b>[Śhrī Mātājī wrote:]<br>
Early in the morning<br>
I pray to the essence of My Spirit<br>
Which is,<br>
‘The Truth, the Attention and the Joy;<br>
So that I can go to the highest state of My ascent.’</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"But when we got our freedom I don’t know what happened to us. We forgot many things. One of them was Gāndhījī, with whom I have lived as a little child, who loved Me very much; <b>and he said, "Let our country be free. First, let our country be free. People who are slaves cannot talk of emancipation.” We became free, quite all right, but then – I don’t understand how – people did not realize their responsibility.</b><br>
Some of them who were very sincere though it’s impossible to work out anything in this country. Then, <b>to My surprise, I saw Śhrī Lal Bahadur Shastri, who was a realized Soul. He knew Me very well, and I was hoping that he will work out the spiritual side of our country and will try to bring a great name for this great Yoga Bhūmi.</b> India, as you know very well, is really a country where so many Saints, Incarnations, poets, of such high understanding and deep feeling were born. He died, and I felt that now all our greatness, all our traditions, all our culture, which has come to us from Saints; Indian culture has not come to us from Freud but has come to us from Saints. And gradually the deterioration, when I saw, I was really amazed how people are taking to things which are destructive for our country, no way constructive."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So again today the first thing we have to know that in our heart lies the power to absorb, to enjoy the beauty of spirituality.
There’s a beautiful śhloka which I had told Mahātmājī that he should put it first, he says I was a very small girl but he listened to Me which is a beautiful thing, "[Marathi]."
Meaning: <b>"Early in the morning I pray to that Principle of my Spirit, which is the Truth, the Attention and Joy, so that I should go to the higher state of my ascent."</b><br> 
So, opening of the heart is very important for all of us."</font><br>
