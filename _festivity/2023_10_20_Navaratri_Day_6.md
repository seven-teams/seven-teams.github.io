<font color="DarkRed">"This is a <b>worship of the Śhakti</b>. Until now many Saints, Sages have known and revealed about this Śhakti. Whatever they could not describe in prose, they tried to convey by poetry. Whatever description was not possible to put in words -- they composed different names of the Devī and described. We know all this and many people also know the meaning of this. But one thing they perhaps do not know is that <b>every human being has all these śhaktis, powers dormant in them and they can awaken them. These dormant powers are eternal and limitless</b>.<br> 
Besides the thirty-three crores of Devas, there are many Śhaktis. But we can say that this `Self-realization' that we have achieved today, has been achieved through working of some Śhakti or the other. Without this you could not have achieved the Self-realization."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today it's such a great day for Me to be with you all, again this year. It's so very joyous and full of fragrance. Today we have decided to have a Pūjā of Śhakti that is the Power, that is the Devī. You know within us there are many Powers of Mahākālī, Mahāsaraswatī, Mahālakṣhmī, Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
All these Powers are there for us to ascent. If these Powers are properly used and understood, then your ascent can be permanent. Once you achieve your ascent and enter into the Kingdom of God, all these Powers get enlightened.<br>
And these Powers which are enlightened are absolutely filled with Love. Enlightenment, we have to understand that we get completely enlightened by Love. So after enlightenment, <b>after Realization we use only one Power which is of Love</b>."</font><br>
