<font color="DarkRed">"<b>We can say, in 1970, 5th May, [for the] first time, the Collective Spirit of God opened out.</b><br>
So far the blessings of God came to human beings individually as Grace. And they received their Self-realization individually, one by one. And the method for individual Realization was just the opposite of the collective. First they had to establish their dharma, cleanse themselves fully, desiring all the time for their salvation, putting their attention to their salvation, as you call it Īśhwarapraṇidhān [desire for God], thinking of God, asking for His Grace and acting in a scrupulous, dhārmik ways to keep themselves pure. They had to control their mind, control their desires, control their action in such a manner that they absolutely kept to the center path. And when they could get through all that testing and immunity, and when they deserved [it], then only the Grace of Mother gave them Realization."</font><br>

Today we are here to celebrate the day when Sahasrāra was opened out. Also you have seen in the Photograph, it was actually the Photograph of My brain which showed how the Sahasrāra was opened out."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"It’s very gratifying to see so many Sahaja Yogis have come to celebrate the Sahasrāra Day.<br>
Without breaking the Sahasrāra, we could not have achieved the ascent en masse. But the Sahasrāra which is the brain has gone into too much complications in the West. And the thoughts are very much twisted, one upon the other. To keep Sahasrāra open should be very easy if the Western brains could understand and be aware about your Mother.<br>
When your Mother is the Deity of Sahasrāra, the only way to be able to keep the Sahasrāra open has to be complete surrendering."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen"><b>Aum twameva sākshāt  Shri Nishkalaṅkā sākshāt Shri Ādi Shakti Mātājī Shrī Nirmalā Devyai namo namah!</b></font><br>
<b>O Divine Mother, You are verily the Spotless and unblemished , Shri Adi Shakti. Salutations to You!</b><br>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"One thing we should keep in mind is that after Self-realization, there are several difficulties till the time we are fully established in the Kingdom of God, and this is related to the power of Śhrī Kalki. Even after their Self-realization, those who still indulge in their old habits, their state is known as ‘yogabhraṣhṭ’ [one who has fallen from the practice of Yoga].<br>
You should take out your attention from little-little things, just give them up. You should live like a great, fully satisfied personality, one who has to help, guide, support and provide awakening to thousands of people.<br>
The mantra of Sahasrāra is ‘Nirmalā’ which means everyone should be clean, tidy, pure and ‘niṣhkalaṅk’ [immaculate, without any blemish/stain].<br>
When the door to the Spirit opens, then there is no shortage of anything. The Mother opens this door. That is why She is dear to Śhrī Gaṇeśha. After which there is no need for anything else. When this state is achieved, then only the Self-realization is complete. Then you are completely absorbed into it and you feel completely blessed."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Sahasrara is your awareness. When it is enlightened you get into the technique of the Divine. Now there are two techniques: the technique of the Divine, and the technique that you follow. You cannot act as Divine, but you can use the Divine power and manoeuvre it. For example, Divine looks after all the Universal happenings.Every minutest particle is controlled by Divine. When your Sahasrara opens out and your Kundalini touches the fontanelle bone, sort of a igniting force is ready in your Sahastrara, and as soon as the fontanelle bone area opens up through the brahmarandhra, the Grace of your Spirit ignites that igniting force and your nadis get enlightened. Not all of them, quite a lot of them; not all the length, but quite the peripheries. That’s how you get your enlightenment."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"We have so know that in our awareness we have to be conscious how far we have achieved the consciousness for our relationship with each other, that is the Collective Consciousness of Virāṭ, of the brain, that is of Sahasrāra. So in principle Sahasrāra is Viṣhṇu Tattwa, but the Deity is Śhrī Mātājī Nirmalā Devī. So you can see how the beautiful integration has taken place.<br>
All the Powers of Śhrī Viṣhṇu have to act according to the Deity, surrendered at the Lotus Feet of the Deity. So the consciousness of Śhrī Viṣhṇu is absolutely in the hands of the Deity. I do not want to talk about this tremendous Deity, it is too much, because it may fill you up with awe. So, whatever is working out, allow it to work out. They say, “Surrender your Sahasrāra to this Deity.” And it’s so, so simple for you, because you have the Deity, you have your own Sahasrāra, and it’s only you, the people who are Sahaja Yogis today in modern times, who have seen the Deity.<br>
They say that you have to ask for three things called ‘Sālokya’, ‘Sāmīpya’, ‘Sanīḍya [Sanīḍa]’ from God; meaning to see God ‘Sālokya’, ‘Sāmīpya’ – the closeness with God and ‘Sanīḍya [Sanīḍa]’ is the companionship of God. But you have got ‘Tādātmya’, which is Oneness with God, which is not in the concept of any one of the Yogis and the Saints and the Seers who have been before. And this ‘Tādātmya’ you have when you are outside My body, while they have this ‘Tādātmya’ when they are inside My body, when they are no more. So you should understand the time limit. You must understand your greatness and you must understand how you people are chosen for the highest work in this creation."</font><br>
