<font color="DarkRed">"All of you are those lamps whom I am describing, those same beautiful lamps who are now enlightened and are enlightening many other lamps. Each lamp is enlightening a thousand others and this is the only way by which the darkness and ignorance of the universe can come to an end.<br>
But we have to remember one thing – <b>the oil with which we are burning is the oil of love, Unconditional Love, a love that does not expect anything in return. This love does not stick to anyone, does not have any desire, does not want any reciprocation, and continuously keeps the lamp burning in a beautiful manner.</b><br>
The gracious beauty and elegance of such a lamp also reflects upon your lotus faces. <b>These lamps shine through your eyes.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Diwālī is supposed to be Enlightenment Day.</b><br>
But enlightenment within is: how much you are in thoughtless awareness.<br>
And everything works out because you are the Ocean of it. You have it within yourself.<br>
Only, you have to tap it. If you don’t tap it, then it doesn’t work out.<br>
You have to just tap it, and you’ll be amazed that you are a source of such joy,<br>
source of such happiness, I should say source of real enlightenment.</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"You are all, as I said, you are My light. And the light is there which is an eternal light. These lights will be finished. We’ll have to light them every year. Not you people. You have eternal light and this light is going to spread Joy. What’s the problem of this world? The whole problem, you take it. There’s no joy. Simple as that – there’s no joy. If they had joy, they would not have done all these nonsensical things.<br>
There’s no joy. When you have joy, you don’t want to fight, you don’t want to do anything that is harmful.<br>
You don’t want to say anything after anyone, not only that but you do not want to have something that will spoil this Mother Earth or which will bring ecological problem. No, you just don’t want it, don’t want to do anything because it harms others. People feel unhappy about it whether it is here, India, anywhere. You just feel that ‘Why should I do such a thing which is not so congenial to others?’ I mean, it’s not joy-giving.<br>
So when you have joy, you have to be joy-giving and if you are not joy-giving that means there’s something lacking in your Sahaja Yoga and that’s why we have to come up now. We have to become Sahaja Yoginīs, Sahaja Yogis. That is joy-giving society. We can change our name if you like. If Sahaja Yoga is not good – Joy-giving Association."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Then the second day is also very important: is the second day is the Moon. That is the Moon came out of the ...... Sea. According to this mythology, the Lakṣhmī came out of the Sea and with Her this Moon came out, which was only a two-day-old Moon, the New Moon but the two-day-old Moon. And this was regarded as the brother of Lakṣhmī, because they were born at the same time from the sea. So He is the brother of Lakṣhmī. It's all symbolic! This is very, very symbolic. </b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Is such a great day today to meet you all. <b>Today is a day we celebrate in India where relationship between brothers and sisters have to be established.</b> They're very pure. Brothers and relationsh... sisters relationship is without any lust or greed. Is pure relationship, where the sister prays for the protection of the brother and brother ...... prays for the self-sufficiency of the kṣhema, well-being, of the sister.<br>
So this time you have to think of your other Sahaja Yoginīs and Sahaja Yogis who are like your brothers and sisters. You have to think like that. Purify your hearts. Is something funny in these countries, you know that, there's no such relationship may exist. Purify your mind today on that point that, `Everybody else is my brother or sister.' If you are married, is all right. But look at everyone, try to look at everyone as a brother, and a sister."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"But for a gṛuhalakṣhmī, the brother is very important.<br>
<b>And the brotherhood and sisterhood is the base of our Sahaj Yoga collectivity.</b> If you understand that brotherhood and sisterhood is love which is very pure, there is no expectation, is just love: is giving love and taking love. And Absolute Purity within us should exist between our relationships when we call them as Sahaj Yogi brothers and sisters. And as there is understanding, complete understanding between the brother and sister, in a family, one has to know we are all part and parcel of a family, born out [of] the same Mother.<br>
Nobody has to shoot off, you know, nobody has to become something great, nobody has to correct others, nobody has to uh say that, ‘I’m something unique.’ All of you have to work it out together and find out the solution working out together, in complete friendship and unison. Anyone who cuts off himself and goes out or becomes anything else goes out of circulation and useless for Sahaj Yoga. Such a person is completely useless: the one who tries to get out of the family. All of you have to be supporting as each other, helping to each other, not shouting at each other, [not] getting angry with each other, trusting each other, not finding faults, treating each other with respect [unclear and love].<br>
This is the most important thing, which Sahaj Yogis don’t understand, that you are Saints and you have to respect each other."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So this is the fifth day is Dvija</b> [Bhāī Dūja]. So from thirteenth to the fifth day, they celebrate Diwālī.<br>
For us, Diwālī has a very great significance. That is: from one light many lights are awakened and they
are put in a line. So they are called as diwālī, means the ‘lights put in a line’. So when you hold My hands together, all of us, through that the energy passes and the enlightened Rāsa is established. <b>And the whole world has to become that beautiful dream of your Mother where nothing but the bliss of your Father and His enjoyment when He sees His own Creation dancing in that Ocean of Bliss.</b><br>
May God bless you!</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Now the last day is very important, is a very universal day I should say, called as Bhaiya Dhuj, this day, or they call it also in Marathi Bhau beej, different names.<br>
<b>The brothers and sisters day. Now the brothers' and sisters' relationship has to be very, very strong.<br>
And the purity of that relationship is to be maintained.</b><br>
It is not necessary that you should be born as brothers and sisters, not necessary.<br>
But you are born, because if you are realized souls you are born as brothers and sisters. So that purity must be maintained in the society of Sahaja Yoga.<br>
Very important, that we should try to develop this situation that brothers and sisters are something very pure.<br>
Their relationships are very pure. And they should not be at all challenged.<br>
It is so much so that even if you call somebody your brother, he is your brother and the more you develop this relationship, the better your left Vishuddhi will be.<br>
Because <b>left Vishuddhi is the relationship with God as a brother or with a Goddess as a sister.</b>"</font><br>
