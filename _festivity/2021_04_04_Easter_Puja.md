<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are here to celebrate the Resurrection of Christ. Resurrection of Christ has the greatest significance for all the Sahaja Yogis and we have to understand that He resurrected Himself so that we could resurrect ourselves.</b><br>
...... The message of His life is His Resurrection and not His cross. He bore the cross for us and we don’t have to bear anymore.<br>
...... He suffered that you should enjoy, that you should be happy, that you should lead a life of complete bliss and gratitude to the Almighty who has created you. He would never like you to be unhappy. Which father would like his son to be unhappy?<br>
So, we have to understand that His Message of His life, why He came on this Earth: to do the greatest job, is that of Resurrection. If He had not resurrected Himself, I could not have worked out Sahaja Yoga.<br>
So, we have to be eternally thankful to His life and to Him, that [for] the way He did all these difficult tasks, taking upon Himself. That, we cannot do, we human beings, cannot do it. It’s only He being the Divine, He being the Auṃ, He being the Logos, He being the Brahma could do it."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So, <b>happy Easter to all!<br>
Today we are celebrating a day which is a very, very important, absolutely the most important, we can say, day, when such a great happening took place. And it had to take place that way, it was all, in a way, destined.</b><br>
In My last lectures, I have told you how Christ was created first in the Heavens. In the ‘Devī Māhātmyam [Bhāgavatam]’, if you read that, He was created as Mahāviṣhṇu and is mentioned very clearly that first He was created as an egg. It is written in this book, which perhaps was written about fourteen thousand years back. It’s a book that predicts about Christ and that is why people, in the West specially, offer an egg to each other as a friend. So, first the existence came on this Earth as an egg, that was Christ, and part of it was kept in that stage and the rest of it was used by the Holy Ghost, by Mahālakṣhmī, to create Christ out of it.<br>
In that ancient book He was called as Mahāviṣhṇu: means the Greater Form of Viṣhṇu. But actually, Viṣhṇu is the Father and He is the Son created by the Holy Ghost.<br>
And when He was created, He cried for His Father, as He cried also on the cross once. And He cried for years. And then Christ, in Mahāviṣhṇu State, was blessed by His Father, who said that, “Your position will be placed higher than Mine and You will be the Ādhāra,” means the Support of the Universe. See, how from Mūlādhāra He becomes the Ādhāra. This was all done at the heavenly stage, Vaikuṇṭha Stage you can say.<br>
Then He was given birth by the Holy Ghost who was the Mother of Christ on this Earth, who was nobody else but was the Incarnation of Mahālakṣhmī, means She was Rādhā. Rā-dhā. Rā means energy, dhā means the one who sustains energy."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So, it was a very sad time when He was crucified. <b>But when He got resurrected it was the most joyous, most auspicious and most beautiful time.<br>
The Resurrection of Christ is very symbolic for Sahaja Yoga. If Christ could be resurrected, then the human beings also can be resurrected, because He came as a human being with all powers and He created the Path of Resurrection for us. This Path of Resurrection is the one that we have followed in Sahaja Yoga."</b></font><br>
<font size="+0"><b>1998-0419 Easter Pūjā, The Message of Resurrection and Be All the Time Prepared to Sacrifice Whatever Is Possible for the Emancipation of Humanity (What We Want Now: to Give Whatever We Have Achieved to Others), Istanbul, Turkey</b></font><br>
<font color="DarkGreen"><b>You promised the comforter who is Śhrī Mātājī, the Holy Spirit.<br>
You return as a king. You are Śhrī Kalki.<br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are celebrating the Resurrection of Christ [and] with it we also have to celebrate the Resurrection of human beings, of Sahaja Yogis who have been resurrected as realized Souls.</b> With that we have to understand that we enter into a new awareness. There was no need for Christ to enter into any new awareness, He had to come down and again to show to this world that you are the eternal life, that you lead a life that is spiritual, which never perishes.<br>
You have to rise into that new realm which is the Realm of God Almighty, what you call the ‘Kingdom of God’. And He said it very clearly to Nicodemus that, “You have to be born-again,” and when he asked, “Am I to enter back into my mother’s womb to be born-again?” And He said it so clearly! It’s so clear. Those who don’t want to see can remain blind! But he said it very very clearly that, “No,” that is,“whatever is born of the flesh is the flesh, but whatever is born of the Spirit is the Spirit.” I mean nothing could be more clear than that, that it has to be born of the Spirit."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"On the Easter Day, we give people eggs to remind them that, ‘You are egg now and you have to become the bird.’ But I don’t think people know that,<br>
<b>because Resurrection is the message of Christ. 
Crucifixion is the accomplishment, but Resurrection is His Message.</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"The other day at the Āśhram I spoke to you about Easter, about the birth of Christ and His Resurrection and the message of Christianity that is Resurrection.<br>
<b>An egg is a very significant thing and it is written in one of the ancient Scriptures in India [as to] why Easter should be celebrated with an egg – is most surprising. It’s very clear there, if one can see, how Christ is symbolized as an egg.</b><br>
Now what is an egg?<br>
In Sanskrit language, a Brahmin is called as dvijaḥ, dvīhi jayati, means the one who is born twice. And a bird is also called, any bird, is called as a dvijaḥ, means twice-born. Because first the bird is born as an egg and then reborn as a bird. In the same way, a human being is born as an egg and then is born as a realized Soul."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Christ came on this Earth to say that we have to seek our Spirit. <b>The message of His life is His Resurrection.</b><br>
<b>On the Easter Day we give eggs to each other. It is very symbolic.</b> In Indian language, a bird is called as khaga – kha-ga – and also dvijaḥ. The first one means the one which goes in the sky, flies in the sky. The second one means the twice-born. And a realized Soul is also called as dvijaḥ.<br>
<b>Christ has talked about your Second Birth throughout. He has said you are to be born-again.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are doing Easter Pūjā.</b><br>
Today is a very important day for Sahaja Yogis because Īsā Masīh [Jesus Messiah (Christ)] has shown us that redemption of human beings is possible, 
and for that redemption, we should always put in an effort.<br>
There is also a meaning why He was crucified.<br>
<b>He was crucified on the cross and this cross is a symbol of the Swastika on the Āgñyā chakra.</b>
He was crucified and He left His body there only. 
He told some important things at that time and one most important thing out of this was<br>
<b>"Wait for the Mother” – “Think of the Mother” [“Behold the Mother”]."</b> "</font><br>
