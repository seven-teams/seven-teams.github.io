<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Acceptance is the only way.</b> Go on accepting it so that you can develop. Like a little plant start accepting whatever the Mother Earth gives it and grows. It does not try to understand the Mother Earth. It does not. It just wants to grow on the riches of the Mother Earth. That is what is Pūjā by which you are blessed by the Divine so that you should of from all the physical, mental, emotional and the so-called spiritual being, which was seeking into the realm where you have sought.<br> 
So today we must determine that we’ll have no rational activity about it, otherwise you won't have the joy of Sahaja Yoga, which is your achievement. Stop rationalizing it. With your heart you do the Pūjā."</font><br>

<font size="+0">Dear All,<br>
On the Auspicious day of the Shashti (6th night of Navarātri), we worship all the Śhaktis. We take the name Śhrī KKātyāyanī (The foster-daughter of Sage KKātyāyana). Sage Kātyāyana underwent long austerities and penance in order to receive the grace of the Mother Goddess. He wished to have a daughter in the form of a goddess. According to his wish and desire, the Mother Goddess granted his request and took an incarnation as Śhrī Durgā.<br> 
Today is the 6th day of the nine nights of Navarātri. Today we propose to have a Havan.</font>

<font color="DarkRed">"In this way many false gurus have taken birth on this Earth. In their previous births they were rākṣhasas like Narakāsura, Mahiṣhāsura, Chaṇḍā, Muṇḍa and others. In addition to those who have been named, a whole lot of them have taken birth. Out of these, there are sixteen main ones, who are most evil and dangerous. Rāvaṇ has also made his entry. They are all on the stage.<br>
Now how can they be destroyed? The time for their destruction has come, but how to kill them? I can take a sword in My Hands and cut off their heads. It is not a difficult job for Me. But they have entered into the hearts and heads of human beings, into their brains. They have all congregated inside, and are sitting there. The people are accepting them as gurus. What am I to do? Can I cut My children’s throats along with them?<br>
So, it would be better that the <b>human beings realize, and expose them publicly, and they will get defeated by their own followers. Then people will see and understand that whatever the Mother has said, every word of it is true</b>."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>This Havan you know is a very good thing for reciting the name of the Goddess.</b> Her eyes are given by fire at this stage. And in that light, in that fire, in the name of Goddess we awaken our Deities within us and throw away all that is wrong in these particular chakras which invoke those powers. So with devotion and understanding, you have to do it. Because you are really privileged people, extremely privileged. Be proud of that, and do with that devotion all these things. Today is a very much better time because the Dussehra and the Navarātri’s, are both combined at this time. And so it has worked out very well. We should do it with full devotion. I think very few people can put in the fire, but we can all do symbolically and say this."</font><br>

In the same way, we have to promise that we will be consuming all that is evil, in a way to destroy it, and we will digest and nourish ourselves with the Divine Knowledge."</font><br>

<b>We are taking it for granted because the Mother Earth as we are exhausting Her morning till evening.<br>
And we, we do not know what harm we are doing to Her and to ourselves.</b><br>
