<font color="DarkRed">"<b>The Devī incarnated on this Earth to kill the demonic personalities who try to destroy all the good qualities of women. We also have those demonic personalities within us and they are to be destroyed – not physically, but mentally.</b><br>
How you accept them and how you deal with whatever they try is very surprising.<br>
<b>You must understand that the goodness of a person is very important. If you are trying to be nasty or dominating then you’ll be definitely destroyed. That’s why this Devī has come on the Earth. That is the assurance of this Devī, the Goddess.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"But Goddess Herself has done so many things for us already, within us, though we are not aware of it. Is said that, <b>"Yā Devī sarvabhūteśhu"</b>: "All those whom You have created," means mostly the human beings, "What do You do? As what do You exist inside the human beings?"<br>
Now, <b>just introspect if you have these qualities within you or not, because they are given to you by the Goddess, by the Śhakti within you.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"You cannot make anyone brahmachārī or brahmachāriṇī. It is a state, avasthā, where a person has to rise, like Yogeśhwara, like Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br>
......<br>
It is a state of mind where you are not involved. It is a different thing, that you just load somebody with an idea that You should become, absolutely a brahmachārī or a brahmachāriṇī or you should lead a celibate life, forcing them.<br>
......<br>
<b>Celibacy must come from within, the purity must come from within.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>It’s a great thing today that we are celebrating the Virgin’s worship</b> in England.<br>
As you know, according to Sahaja Yoga, England is the heart where resides the Spirit of Śhiva. And that Virgin should be respected and revered, uh worshiped in England is a great honor, I think, for all the Sahaja Yogis.<br>
Now one has to think, ‘Why such an importance is paid to a Virgin? Why a Virgin is respected ... to that extent? What are the Powers of a Virgin?’ That She can bear a child of that magnitude that was Christ, that She could create Śhrī Gaṇeśha out of Her own body, that She could protect innocent, dynamic force of Her children who are egoless, who have not known what is ego.<br>
So this Great Power and Force resides in a person who has lots of puru [many, abundant] puṇyas, who has done lots of good things in previous lives, who has always understood that Virginity is a power higher than any other power and would save the Virginity and Chastity with all Her effort and care.<br>
As you know that, within our body, She is placed as Kuṇḍalinī. [It] means She is the Virgin. She is untouched. The desire to become Spirit is without any blemish: nirmala. There is no blemish. I[t]s waiting is pure. There’s no other desire, but to be one with the Divine. All other desires are finished."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="red">"When we lose our Innocence and our Virginity, first thing happens to us is that we become ego-oriented, and we start thinking “what’s wrong?”<br>
<b>Your śhakti is your Kuṇḍalinī and She is Virginity. She is your power. She is your strength.</b> Your Innocence is your strength, the day you lost it that is the day we have committed the original sin."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>You must pray to God and ask what you want.<br>
Ask for, 'Complete satisfaction in my heart, joy in my heart, bliss in my heart, so that the whole world becomes blissful. Give me love, love that I could love the whole world and that the whole world becomes one in love. Give salvation to the entire humanity which is suffering. Take me to Your Feet. Cleanse me with Thy Love.'</b></font><br>
