<font color="DarkRed">"Today we are going to worship Rādhā, Kṛiṣhṇa. It’s a very festive feeling because Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa came on this Earth at a time when people had become extremely serious about religion, about spirituality, and uhh that made the whole aspect of religion as a joyless achievement.<br>
And that’s how people became very serious; also the attention of people was diverted into a kind of a drama, which created aloofness from the society. People became individualistic, secretive and all such people’s children also became the same style because a kind of a fear, perhaps, developed among the people who were in pursuit of religion and Truth."</font><br>

Now, what is the Dharma of Virāṭa? What is the Dharma of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa? Is collectivity."</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Now, as you know that United States, or America, the whole of it, is the Viśhuddhi chakra. Out of which, we have three sides to the Viśhuddhi chakra. So the central part of the Viśhuddhi chakra is United States.<br>
<b>The central part of the Viśhuddhi chakra is governed by Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. And His Power is Rādhā. Rā-dhā. Rā means energy, dhā is the one who has sustained the energy. Rā-dhā.</b> "Dhārayati [yena] sa [dharmaḥ]"" [related to Mahābhārata 12.110.11]. So, she's the one who has sustained the energy, and so, she's called as Rādhā. She's the Power of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br>
The word Kṛiṣhṇa comes from the word -- kṛiṣhi, means -- the plowing, or you can say, agriculture is called as kṛiṣhi. The one who plows and puts the seed in the soil, is doing the kṛiṣhi. And, that's why He's called as Kṛiṣhṇa.<br>
Now, the seed that he has sown, is the seed of spirituality. It is Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa who said, in Sanskrit "Nainaṃ chindanti śhastrāṇi, nainaṃ dahati pāvakaḥ, Na chainaṃ kledayanty āpo, na śhoṣhayati mārutaḥ" [Bhagavad Gītā 2.23], meaning -- it cannot be, means, the spiritual life or you can say, the eternal life, or the Spirit, cannot be killed by anything, by any weapon, neither can be blown away by air, nor can it be sucked in, nor can it be destroyed."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"So, today, actually, with all this theme that I’m talking about, uh about collectivity, which is the blessing of uh Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br>
And that uh His essence was mādhurya, is the sweetness. And Rādhā, who was His Energy, was known for Āhlāda Dāyinī.<br>
Āhlāda Dāyinī means the One who is joy-giving – āhlād [joy, delight, refreshing, reviving] is even more than joy – hmm, Who was the ... Āhlāda.<br> 
Sorry but, uh you see, joy can be very general word but āhlād means a bubbling of joy.<br>
When you see somebody, they, bubbling of joy. That is Her Power. And She was the Power of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa."</b></font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So the main Principle of Kṛiṣhṇa was collectivity – Rāsa – everybody one with the energy</b>; energy circulates through everyone, and just the opposite that the country developed into individualism and everything was to create something that collective was not. Individualism, when it is not connected to the mains, is destruction. Like all these trees you see, they are individuals as you see them separate, but inside they are fed by the same Mother [Earth]. They have the same sap running in them. When this connection is broken, then all this individualism is nothing but destruction and that’s how in America the connection with the collectivity was broken by every sort of funny methods that one cannot conceive how human beings can go to that level."</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"But the basis of collectivity, the foundation of collectivity is very deep. 
And the deep understanding can only tell you that the basis of collectivity is detached love. 
Love is the only way. Is not possible to have collectivity unless and you have ... unless and until you have detached love."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Collectivity, you are representatives of the Virāṭ of the Collective Being. Complete circulation and love and affection. Not that love and affection mean perverted or degenerated, but pure love, pure love, enjoying another person’s Spirit. You are responsible for it. If I cannot get Viśhuddhi chakra all right, Sahaja Yoga won’t be all right. Viśhuddhi chakra has to be all right, though last time I said I’ll never go to America. How can it be? I have to come again and again. And you have to be greater and greater people, understanding the responsibility you have towards Divine. Be responsible. It’s not only that Michael is responsible or somebody else is responsible. Every one of you. You are like the vowels. Vowels are important. Without vowels, consonants have no meaning. Everybody is a vowel. Everybody has to be responsible."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So, when you meet a friend, you know, how you feel like: just uh taking him to your heart.<br>
Just uh embracing, and you don’t know what to do with that.<br>
And sometimes is so much that you feel like beating. Beating yourself and beating the friend.<br> 
<b>That sort of a joy is Āhlāda Dāyinī: that is Rādhā.<br>
So today, let us now, the Power of Joy we have to worship today, Power of Joy. And this Power of Joy which is Āhlāda Dāyinī</b> uh, of course, we do the same way but with the idea that now we are praying that our heart should open uh by Śhiva.<br>
And once our heart is open, it will be expressed by the Power of Śhrī Rādhā and Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. This is the combination today.<br>
Let us have this way that is a combination of heart-opening, through Viśhuddhi we are expressing it.<br>
Like some people, specially women, when they are over joyous they start weeping and crying. See, that’s āhlāda!"</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So the wisdom of Sahaja Yoga is in understanding the limitations up to which you can go to express your anger, to express your revenge, so-called [smiles], on anyone whatsoever. But the best thing would be to leave it to the Divine Power, because everything is done by Divine Power. We all exist inside the Divine Power.<br>
......<br>
So to leave it in the hands of Divine Power and to be just an instrument of that Divine Power, is the way Sahaja Yogi has to be. Because the compassion, the love of Divine Power is so great that it is wisdom, complete wisdom. A person who has no compassion cannot be wise. He could be worldly-wise but he could not be really wise. So, those who believe that they have to be ...... they have to be very accurate, must know that your accuracy will be challenged by the Divine Power. There has to be lot of relaxed and a mobile temperament a person should have.<br>
......<br>
You are all friends to each other. And the greatest friend you have is the Divine Power, which is looking after you and doing everything for you. If you have that kind of a relaxed, beautiful alertness within you, you are going to enjoy life, you are going ... going to enjoy Sahaja Yoga and you are going to get many, many more people doing Sahaj Yog. And if you don’t have this among yourselves, then people are going to say, ‘Oooh, Mother, whatever You may say, but Sahaja Yogis are no good!’ "</font><br>
