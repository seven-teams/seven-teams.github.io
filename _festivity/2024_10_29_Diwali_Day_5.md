<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Actually, only after Sahaja Yoga started, the real Diwālī is taking shape.</b> We had many beautiful lamps, and we had lot of oil to burn, but there was no spark, to enlighten the dīpas. And the wick, as you call it -- is called as bātī in Hindi language -- is like your Kuṇḍalinī, so the Kuṇḍalinī had to meet the spark. The beautiful lamps were all a waste, purposeless, pointless. And this is the great blessings in modern times, that so many lights are enlightened and we are having a dīpāwali of human hearts. When you become the light, you don't worry about the lamp, how it looks, how it is to be made, it's all done. You just have to worry about the flame, about the oil, because it's the oil that burns and gives light. "</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So this is the fifth day is Dvija [Bhāī Dūja]. So from thirteenth to the fifth day they celebrate Diwālī.</b><br>
For us Diwālī has a very great significance. That is: from one light many lights are awakened and they are put in a line. So they are called as diwālī, means the `lights put in a line'. So when you hold My hands together, all of us, through that the energy passes and the enlightened Rāsa is established. And the whole world has to become that beautiful dream of your Mother where nothing but the bliss of your Father and His enjoyment when He sees His own Creation dancing in that Ocean of Bliss.<br>
May God bless you!"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"We have to be like a beautiful tower of light. Like a lighthouse. And everybody should work it out within and without. Within though you have worked out, without you must work now.<br>
And secondly there's a dīpāwali [row of lights], it is not only one light. <b>So we have to be all collective, try to get to collective life. Whenever it is possible, try to attend all that is collective; try to be there, where there is collective happenings. There, where it is collective, this source of energy flows better.</b><br>
May God bless you all! "</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Then the second day is also very important: is the second day is the Moon. That is the Moon came out of the ...<br>
... Sea. According to this mythology, the Lakṣhmī came out of the Sea and with Her this Moon came out, which was only a two-day-old Moon, the New Moon but the two-day-old Moon. And this was regarded as the brother of Lakṣhmī, because they were born at the same time from the sea. So He is the brother of Lakṣhmī. It's all symbolic! This is very, very symbolic."</font><br>

O Divine Mother, You are verily the radiance of the Full Moon! Salutations to You!<br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Now, the last day is very important: is a very universal day, I should say, called as Bhāī Dūj. is the ... or they call it also in Marathi Bhāūbīj, the ... different names. Is the: brothers' and sisters' day.<br>
Now, the brothers' and sisters' relationship has to be very, very strong. And the purity of that relationship is to be maintained. Is not necessary that you should be born as brothers and sisters, not necessary. But you are born, because if you are realized Souls you are born as brothers and sisters. So that purity must be maintained in the society of Sahaja Yoga. Very important it is. That we should try to develop this situation that brothers and sisters are something very pure. Their relationships are very pure. And they should not be at all challenged.<br>
It is so much so that even if you call somebody your brother, he is your brother and the more you develop this relationship, the better your left Viśhuddhi will be. Because left Viśhuddhi is the relationship with God as a brother or with a Goddess as a sister."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is a day we celebrate in India where relationship between brothers and sisters have to be established.</b> They're very pure. Brothers and relationsh... sisters relationship is without any lust or greed. Is pure relationship, where the sister prays for the protection of the brother and brother play ... pray ... prays for the self-sufficiency of the kṣhema, well-being, of the sister."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"But for a gṛuhalakṣhmī, the brother is very important.<br>
<b>And the brotherhood and sisterhood is the base of our Sahaja Yoga collectivity.</b> If you understand that brotherhood and sisterhood is love which is very pure, there is no expectation, is just love: is giving love and taking love. And Absolute Purity within us should exist between our relationships when we call them as Sahaja Yogi brothers and sisters. And as there is understanding, complete understanding between the brother and sister, in a family, one has to know we are all part and parcel of a family, born out [of] the same Mother.<br>
Nobody has to shoot off, you know, nobody has to become something great, nobody has to correct others, nobody has to uh say that, 'I'm something unique.'<br>
All of you have to work it out together and find out the solution working out together, in complete friendship and unison.<br>
Anyone who cuts off himself and goes out or becomes anything else, goes out of circulation and useless for Sahaja Yoga. Such a person is completely useless: the one who tries to get out of the family.<br>
All of you have to be supporting as each other, helping to each other, not shouting at each other, [not] getting angry with each other, trusting each other, not finding faults, treating each other with respect [<font color="orange">unclear</font> and love].<br>
This is the most important thing, which Sahaj Yogis don't understand, that you are Saints and you have to respect each other. "</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>This is the promise of Diwālī to you all, that you will reach highest and the noblest way of life.</b> Every word I say will be there to prove what I say is there. Whatever petty problems you have, they'll all be washed off. All these are the messages from the Divine, you don't have to worry about petty things, about money, about jobs, that's not your job. Your destiny will work it out. You have a promise that you'll be looked after. I hope you believe in that promise and are joyous in the highest way.<br>
I bless you all from My heart, all of you, for a very happy and prosperous Diwālī."</font><br>
