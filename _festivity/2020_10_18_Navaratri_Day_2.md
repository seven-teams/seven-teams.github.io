<font color="DarkRed">"<b>What is Pūjā?</b> Pūjā is also a means to enter into that Infinite. What is Namāz? It is a mantra to enter that Infinite. What is prayer? It is a rendition to enter into that Infinite. But, without permission, without connection, there is no meaning to these. You can do as much pūjā as you wish, it is worthless.<br> 
...... <b>Without connection whatever pūjā and worship takes place, that too when it goes into extremes and out of balance, becomes harmful.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"...... <b>this is the highest Pūjā, the greatest ritual, which you can attend.</b> So why do we do Navarātri? In the heart, <b>to do Navarātri is to accept the Powers of the Śhakti, to realize the power that all these chakras have got in themselves</b>, and that when they are enlightened how you can express all these powers of these Nine Chakras within ourselves; the seven chakras plus the heart and the Moon makes it nine. But I would say that seven of these and on top of that, we should say two more centers, which Blake has described surprisingly as nine centers, clearly. Just now I cannot talk of the higher two centers, but let us at least talk of the seven centers."</font><br>

<font size="+0">Dear All,<br>
Today, we celebrate the second day of Navarātri. On this day we recite the Devī Suktam.<br>
Let us all worship collectively Śhrī Mātājī in Her form of Śhrī Brahmacharini.<br>
Śhrī Brahmacharini is another form of Śhrī Durgā, She is the one who observes the state of Celibacy. She is shown as holding rosary in her right hand and a water utensil in her left hand.<br>
Let us today imbibe her quality of chastity in us.</font><br>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>The Devī incarnated on this Earth to kill the demonic personalities who try to destroy all the good qualities of women. We also have those demonic personalities within us and they are to be destroyed – not physically, but mentally.</b><br>
How you accept them and how you deal with whatever they try is very surprising.<br>
You must understand that the goodness of a person is very important. If you are trying to be nasty or dominating then you’ll be definitely destroyed. That’s why this Devī has come on the Earth. <b>That is the assurance of this Devī, the Goddess.</b>"</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">You cannot make anyone Brahmachari or Brahmacharini. It is a state – avastha –, where a person has to rise, like Yogeshwara, like Shrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br>
......<br>
It is a state of mind where you are not involved. It is a different thing, that you just load somebody with an idea that You should become, absolutely a Brahmachari or a Brahmacharini or you should lead a celibate life, forcing them.<br>
......<br>
<b>Celibacy must come from within, the purity must come from within.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Now one has to think why such an importance is paid to a Virgin? Why a Virgin is respected to that extent? What are the Powers of a Virgin? That She can bear a child of that magnitude that was Christ, that She could create Śhrī Gaṇeśha out of Her own body, that She could protect innocent, dynamic force of Her children who are egoless, who have not known what is ego. So this Great Power and Force resides in a person who has lots of ‘pūrva puṇyas’ who has done lots of good things in previous lives, who has always understood that <b>Virginity is a power higher than any other power and would save the Virginity and Chastity with all her effort and care. As you know that within our body She is placed as Kuṇḍalinī.</b><br>
Means She is the Virgin. She is untouched. <b>The desire to become Spirit is without any blemish: Nirmal.</b><br>
There is no blemish. It’s waiting is pure. There is no other desire, but to be one with the Divine. All other desires are finished.<br>
It’s a very difficult subject for Me to talk about in the Western country. It’s embarrassing. I do not
want anyone of you, whether men or women, to develop any guilt in your mind. Because that is one thing is the greatest blemish as you know, at a later stage this guilt works in the opposite direction. It is of no help. <b>But when we understand that we have these problems, we have to be humble about it. Not guilty but humble.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="Red">"You must pray to God and ask what you want.<br>
Ask for complete satisfaction in my heart, joy in my heart, bliss in my heart, so that the whole world becomes blissful.<br>
Give me love, love that I could love the whole world and that the whole world becomes one in love.<br>
Give salvation to this humanity which is suffering.<br>
Take me to Your feet. Cleanse me with Thy love."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So one must know that these are the Laws of the Divine, that we have to live with self-respect, that we have to be chaste, that we have to have dignity, that we cannot steal money and steal things and be parasites.</b> That we cannot kill others and we cannot beat others and say harsh things, they are just the same. And that we have respect, the respect for all that is sublime. Respect for all the Saints that are Sahaja Yogis."</b></font><br>

W<font size="+0">e pray to Śhrī Adi Shakti, please hear us:<br>
Violence and the perversion of sex in the media pollute the consciousness of the masses.<br>
The diseases of modern life such as cancer, AIDS, and insanity are the direct result of our self-made hellish environment.<br>
Drugs and alcohol throw people into a regression of their consciousness<br>
Śhrī Adi Shakti, please undo the evil that men have done.</font><br>
