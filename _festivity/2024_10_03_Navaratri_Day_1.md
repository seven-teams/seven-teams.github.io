<font color="DarkRed">"In the first Advent of the Holy Ghost came on this Earth this day. That was about fourteen thousands years back. And today is the day that is celebrated as the first Advent. And there are Nine Advents She has had before She came as the Mahālakṣhmī. She first, today I will be telling you about it -- how She is placed within us, where She resides, what is Her work, how She protects us. I'll be today telling you on the Heart chakra. And that's why today they celebrate this special day of Her worship."</font><br>

<font color="Indigo"><b>Namo Devyai Mahadevyai</b><br>
The Gods said: Salutations to the Devi, to the Great Goddess.<br>
<font color="Indigo"><b>Shivayai satatam namah</b><br>
Salutations always to Her who is ever auspicious<br>
<font color="Indigo"><b>Namah Prakrutyai Bhadrayi</b><br>
Salutations to Her who is primordial cause and the sustaining power.<br>
<font color="Indigo"><b>Niyataha pranataha-smatam</b><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So, it was-s ... such a worshipful country, where people worshipped the Gods with their heart and with their devotion, that there were Incarnations of the God many times on this Earth. And They uh did that part, of that aspect, tried to protect the people who were in danger, specially the Mother. Mother came many a times out of which we celebrate nine special times when She came and killed very horrible devils on this Earth.<br>
<b>Now the same Mother, according to Sahaja Yoga, has got three types of action.</b> She is a Mahālakṣhmī because She is in the center, by which She ascents. And <b>She is the desire of God as Ādi Śhakti, the Primordial Being ... the Primordial Mother, who becomes first the desire. So She is the Mahākālī.</b> And then She becomes the creative force or the creative energy, so She is the Mahāsaraswatī. So first we have the Mahākālī, who becomes Mahāsaraswatī, and then ultimately the Mahālakṣhmī. So the first the desire, then the action, and then thirdly the as... ascent, or you can say the uh sustainance [sustenance].<br>
First, you were sustained as human beings. Now you have become as human beings, now you have to ascent higher, into that superhuman state where you start feeling the Divine, the Power of the Divine, and also the Divinity within yourself. Then gradually as you grow up, you settle down into the kingdom of God by which you are completely blessed."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Gaṇas are the workers on the left-hand side. They are like, we can say Saint Michael is their leader, but their king is Gaṇapati, Gaṇeśha.<br>
<b>So first She has done is the ghaṭasthāpanā.</b><br> 
Ghaṭasthāpanā means -- you have done here now, this is the ghaṭasthāpanā. This is the Kumbha.<br>
Now this Kumbha She has established first: that is the triangular bone. Now this is Her first work, that to establish this, your Mūlādhāra. So She established within you is innocence. She established innocence within you to begin with. So She has put this ghaṭa in which She is staying as Kuṇḍalinī now. So the first is that to establish the Kuṇḍalinī in the triangular bone, and then to establish Śhrī Gaṇeśha. This is the first work, by which whatever She is going to create now -- all the universes, the Earth, everything -- whatever She is going to create has to be filled with innocence. "</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Similarly with God Almighty. <b>When He desired to create this nature, He collected a desire, we may say a wave or vibration, and filled within a container or Ghaṭ. It is that Ghaṭ. And this Ghaṭ means the God Almighty.</b><br>
If we can separate God Almighty and His power of desire for our understanding, then it will be easy to understand.<br>
You, people, are similar but with a slight difference. You and your desire powers are different. First, the power of your desire is born. Until you have a desire for anything, nothing is executed.<br>
This means [that] this beautiful universe is created because of someone's desire. Everything is executed after a desire. To execute the desire of God Almighty it has to be separated from Him. We will call it Ādi Śhakti.<br>
<b>When this first stage arrived this Ghaṭasthāpanā happened. This happened so many times in ancient times and even today when we have Ghaṭasthāpanā we memorize that aboriginal happening. So on the first day of Navarātri, we do Ghaṭasthāpanā, means, remember, what an important thing it is.</b><br>
Whatever God Almighty desired at that time collected and filled in a Ghaṭ before its execution. Today we are worshiping that desire, we worshiped it today. God Almighty had that desire and brought us up to human being-ness, up to this height stage he brought us, now it is your duty to bow in front of His desire.<br>
<b>In our Sahaja Yoga, this desire is called Śhrī Mahākālī's Desire or Mahākālī's Power.</b> This is Mahākālī's Power and these nine special days of Navarātri are about the incarnations of Śhrī Mahākālī."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today we worship the Himalayas and the seven Goddesses whose blessings are here, and pray to them to bless us with Devī Śhakti. We have received the blessings of the Devī Śhakti from a Mother. That is why, in the form of Mother, let us come to the feet (śharaṇāgat) of the Himalayas.<br>
