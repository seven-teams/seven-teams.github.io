<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is the day when we celebrate Mahāśhivarātri. It's a great day, or we should say great night. This Pūjā should have been in the night!<br>
It's a great night when Śhiva was established on this Earth.</b> Because that way Śhiva is eternal. So one would say that, `Why Śhiva, like a Birthday of Śhiva you can say or something, how can it be? Because He is eternal! He is all the time there!' So, what demarcates today's celebration, is the establishment of Śhiva on this Earth. In the material self.<br>
Every matter has been created with a Deity in [it]. And that Deity is established in that matter as you know. So, then it was thought by Ādi Śhakti that first you must establish Śhiva: without Śhiva you cannot establish anything. First He is to be established, because He is the Absolute."</font><br>

...... He was reflected on this Earth as Śhiva on the Kailāśha. His residence is Kailāśh. That is why He is a Dakṣhiṇāmūrti, He is looking at the dakṣhiṇ -- means looking at the south. He's looking at the south because He is the man who is the Spectator of all the things that are happening."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today we are here to celebrate Mahāśhivarātri.<br>
It’s a very great privilege for all of us to understand about Śhrī Mahādeva. Unless and until you have got your Self-realization you cannot understand what is the great personality, the character and the Powers of Śhrī Mahādeva.<br>
Is not easy to conceive, also to reach the depth, of His greatness unless and until we are humble. We have to be very humble to reach at the Lotus Feet of Śhrī Mahādeva. As you have seen that one has to cross even the Sahasrāra to be at the Lotus Feet of this great personality. He is beyond, beyond all our conception, but He resides in our hearts as the Spirit, and is reflected very well when you get your Realization."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"When the Kuṇḍalinī crosses the Mahālakṣhmī Path, It comes up to the Sahasrāra and breaks the Brahmarandhra,<br>
becoming one with the All-pervading Power of the Śhiva Tattwa.<br>
Because Sadāśhiva is on our fontanel bone, His ... His legs are resting on our fontanel bone area.<br>
When the Kuṇḍalinī touches His Feet, then the Śhiva Tattwa in our heart, which is the Spirit, is enlightened, and we get the enlightenment.<br>
This is the Yoga, which we achieve through our uh Sahaja System.<br>
And that is why we have now worshiped the Mahālakṣhmī."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"I have told you about the origin before. Because on the Day of Mahāśhivarātri, when there is a talk about Śhivjī, then it has to begin with origin. How much He is Primordial, means when there is a first manifestation of form of God Almighty.<br>
He is called as Sadāśhiva when He is enlightened from Brahma. That is why the one who is Śhivjī is called as Ādi [Primordial].<br>
You see, before the complete manifestation of any tree its seed has to be seen first and that is why it has to be called ‘Bīj Swarūpa’ – form of the seed. That is why the glory of Śhiva is very important. After that, after His manifestation, the power within Him gets Her form and is called as Ādi Śhakti.<br>
The same Ādi Śhakti enlightens the three forms of the God differently which you know as Brahmā, Viṣhṇu and Maheśh, that is, Śhiv Śhaṅkar. It means that Ādi Śhakti holds the three aspects of a diamond.<br>
And when in the Doomsday the whole created universe, whole manifested world gets dissolved and the same is incarnated in the form of Brahma, then also Sadāśhiva remains there. And his connection to the part of God is always maintained which is never manifested and which is a non-being."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"It’s a great pleasure that from all over the world people have gathered to worship Śhiva. Actually, we should say it is Sadāśhiva that we are going to worship today. As you know the difference between Sadāśhiva and Śhrī Śhiva. <b>Sadāśhiva is the God Almighty and He is a witness of the play of the Primordial Mother.</b><br>
The combination between Sadāśhiva and the Primordial Mother Ādi Śhakti is just like a moon and the moonlight or the sun or the sunlight. We cannot understand such relationship in human being, among human marriages or among human relationships. So whatever the Ādi Śhakti’s creating, which is the desire of Sadāśhiva, is being witnessed by Him. And when He is watching this creation He is witnessing all of it into all details. He witnesses the whole universe and He also witnesses this Mother Earth, all the creation that is done by the Ādi Śhakti. His Power is of witnessing and the Power of Ādi Śhakti is this All-pervading Power of Love.<br>
<b>So the God Almighty, the Father, the Primordial Father we can say, expresses His Desire, His Icchā Śhakti as the Primordial Mother and She expresses Her Power as Love. So the relationship between the two is extremely understanding, very deep, and whatever She’s creating, if She finds, if He finds there is some problem or there are people, human beings specially who are trying to obstruct Her work, or even the Gods who are not the Deities are trying to express their egos, He is the one who brings forth their
destruction. So He is the one who is responsible for the destructive power.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"I had told that Śhiva Pūjā means more explanation, more understanding, more this thing; because in other Pūjās we do all these mantras, this, that, but <b>in this Pūjā is to know the knowledge, it’s God</b>.<br>
And to know that you know God itself is so great. Whatever it is – She may be Mahāmāyā, She may be anything, but I know Her. It cannot be described in one book, it cannot be described in hundred books.<br>
It cannot be described in words, but to know that’s God – after all, that’s God, God Almighty. And that gives you that beautiful surrender, where you just feel absolutely secured in that Ocean of Love.<br>
I wish you all to achieve that state.<br>
May God bless you."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"> "...... <b>we have to invite, Āvāhana as they call it, innovation, invite the Deity of Śhiva and Pārvatī.<br>
