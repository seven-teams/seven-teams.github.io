<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Holī was started during the time of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.</b> Before Him in the time of Śhrī Rāma ... He was very austere. Because of that, the society became very peaceful but people were devoid of all joy. So He thought that there should be a way by which people should be able to laugh freely and be joyful. And like it happens to all such ventures it happened in the case of Holī also that it produced an opposite effect.<br>
...... <b>The story of how it started is like this.</b> There was a demoness called Holikā. She was the sister of Prahlād and Prahlād’s father used to trouble him a lot. Holikā had a boon that she would not be burnt by the fire. Prahlād’s father wanted to kill him and told Holikā to take the child [Prahlād] and sit on the burning pyre thinking that she would not die. But it is surprising that she died and Prahlād was not hurt in the fire and came out of it unscathed.<br>
This is a very big happening which demonstrated that it is very wrong to be cruel and aggressive. She had the boon but still, she got burnt. That’s why we have this custom on Holī.<br>
In our country [India] all such things have a lot of truthfulness. We have to understand that if we do wrong things, trouble others ... then these are demonic qualities.<br>
...... We should not have these demonic qualities because we are Sahaja Yogis. We are a special race of people who have taken birth to transform this world and we should pay our attention towards that. We are very highly placed, higher than all others and we have to save all others from such tendencies. These days it has spread a lot. That’s why all such hateful, cruel behavior by which we dominate others, torture others is very, very bad and there is no need to do all that in Sahaja Yoga."</font><br>

[SYNOPSIS!]<br>
[People Celebrate Holī only on the outside, the real Holī is to be burnt within first. This means the negativity within has to be burnt first. Delhi being the capital is full of politics. Sahaja Yogis absorb these politics and it spreads in the Sahaja collectivity like flu. We cannot ascend by it. We should not form any groups or believe in any caste. Someone like Nārad Muni comes along and fans the flames of animosity one against the other. But we should not play into the hands of such people. We should realize that our relationship is with Mother only.]"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"As you know, on the day of Holi, Holika was burnt. Agni had a very big blessing and task, because Agni Devatā had given Holika a boon that in any circumstance, she will not burn, that death could come to her in any form, but not by fire. And after giving this boon, he regretted a lot because she took Prahlād in her lap and sat in the fire. And Agni Devatā had a big dilemma, that “I have given this promise to her, that I will not burn her and how can I fulfill this promise? And Prahlād, is Himself innocence personified, He is himself an Incarnation of Śhrī Gaṇeśha and how can I burn Him? Nobody can burn him. And He is also beyond my powers. He is formed from my power.” So he thought, “What is this ego? that in front of such a great power what can I talk about my power? I have no such power which can face Him. His power is so great that I cannot burn him whatsoever I may try. But at this time I have a very big dilemma in front of me.”<br>
<b>So in-between ‘duty’ and ‘dharma’ the dilemma is in-between these two. In this situation, we must understand that dharma is higher than duty.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"To know God Itself is such a great blessing because He is the God Almighty. The God who has all the Powers and all the loved ones. He is our Father, He is waiting for us to enter into His Kingdom, to enjoy that peace and beauty of His Being, because He has created us and He wants this creation to come up to that.<br>
Today, the great day of Holikā Dahana, where the symbolism of this occasion is that the satanic forces were burnt by the innocence of Prahlāda. And that is what we have to remember, that when the Sahaja Yogis take to innocence and complete dependence on to their vibratory awareness, which is the indication of God’s Manifestation through them, they are completely protected, and even a satanic person like Holikā could not burn him [them]. And this is the day today, we have to recognize that as Sahaja Yogis we stand no dangers in life. We are fearless people, but we are humble people, loving people, and anxious to save as many as possible. To raise the whole humanity into another awareness, in the process of your evolution you have to achieve, for which you have to work hard."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"The experience of God’s Love has been described in many books of ours but nobody believes in them.<br>
For example, when Prahlād, in whose presence Narasiṃha incarnated, was asked, “What do you want?” he replied,<br>

that is “O God, give me the love of Your Lotus Feet.”</b> "</b></font><br>
