<font color="DarkRed">"Ādi Śhakti's Power, this Divine, is described in every religion. Say, in Islam [is] called Rūḥ, in the Bible is called as [the] All-pervading Power, is called as Alakh, that is not to ... which cannot be seen, Nirañjanā, the One which is beyond any attachments sort of thing. All these words are used for this Divine Power."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Ādi Śhakti, to describe You is the work of poets and Saints, yet words cannot even begin to express Your magnificence.<br>
You are Parāśhakti, the power beyond all powers.<br>
Give us, O Śhrī Ādi Śhakti, greater humility so that we can gain some small glimpse of Your glory.<br>
Make us like the Sufis and the Gnostics adoring You at every moment.</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So we are going to have one short musical piece and just to tell you a little bit about music. A lot of people, music seems to communicate with lots of people in different ways, it is very inspiring, and one of the things with the music which is produced by the Sahaja Yogis is that as they are connected, the music itself has vibrations so perhaps if they play something you can have your hands out and you may feel the cool breeze as a result of the of the music. We find that the music is one of the easiest ways to enjoy, so we have lots of people playing music."</font><br>
