<font color="DarkRed">"The great work done in Gaṇapatīpuḷe is worthy to be written in history, big work has been done, and it will keep happening every year ahead. <b>My ardent desire is that it should continue at least for the next three, four years. And if this happens, then you people will also get the idea about it that what we started from Gaṇapati, that has reached perfectly to Sahasrāra.</b> All this is so aditi [primordial] that it is difficult to express in words. And all this you should receive. You should receive whatever belongs to Me, this is My only pure desire. And when this works out, then I do not want anything."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"See, <b>Qawwali is a style, developed by a realized Soul called Amīr Khusaro.</b> He was a devotee of Pazan Nizam ... Nizamuddin kasa from Delhi [Amīr once told Chishti Shaikh Nizamuddin Auliya that he wants to be known as ‘kasa lais’ (licker of the plates)]. He was another realized Soul.<br>
They call him Auliyas. A realized Soul, what we call Avadhūtas, were called as Auliyas. Now, among the Muslims, realized Souls didn’t have that place in the organizational’s method of worship. So because Amīr Khusaro was a realized Soul he recognized his great guru. He went to him and he started learning about Self-realization and everything from him. And we had another one in Chishti [Sufi order that emphasizes love, tolerance, and openness which originated around 930 B.C. in Chisti, a small town near Herat, Afghanistan], a Great Soul. Now, these two great Souls were on this Earth but were not accepted by Mullahs because they were not realized Souls. So, so many people became devotees, of these Auliyas and they say Auliyas have no caste. Just like Sahaja Yogis have no caste.<br>
Now, this Qawwali started in the praise of the Spirit and all that by Amīr Khusaro and this Qawwali system started working out throughout in the country, now even in Pakistan we have some very great Qawwals who are realized Souls also. I’ve seen one of them was Nusrat Hussain or something like that. Is a very well-known Qawwal. And he immediately recognized Me. He’s also a realized Soul.<br>
Now the Qawwali was sung only by men, and in the praise of God, like bhajan. And it has a style. But then, as everything gets perverted, Qawwali got also perverted, and cheap women started singing them in a very cheap way, it’s all got spoiled. But I’m very happy that again I can hear this Qawwali back in the praise of God."</font><br>
