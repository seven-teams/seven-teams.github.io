<font color="DarkRed">"<b>We have all assembled here to worship Lord Śhiva. Śhiva Pūjā is a very great and special Pūjā.<br>
The ultimate aim of human beings is to attain that Śhiva Tattwa.</b><br>
Śhiva Tattwa is beyond the brain. It cannot be known through the brain. Till you have got your Self-realization you cannot know the Self, Ātmā or the Śhiva Tattwa.<br>
Too much falsehood, myth and blind faith has taken place in the name of Lord Śhiva.<br>
Till a person is self-realized he cannot know Lord Śhiva because his nature is such that to know Him, a person has first to attain that height where all the great virtues themselves enshrine within.<br>
<b>He is said to be the innocent Śhaṅkara.</b><br>
......<br>
Where everything is happening and activating by itself, what role has Lord Śhiva to play: <b>He witnesses everything innocently. The Śhakti created the Universe, all the Gods, Deities and Their roles, the role of Lord Śhiva is only to witness.</b><br>
In that witnessing everything happens. On whosoever His glance falls, such a person is redeemed. Wherever His Attention goes, it blesses. Everything is a play, He does not have to do anything. Like play is for children, similarly it is a play for God. He witnesses.<br>
There is another aspect of His innocence. When an innocent, truthful and upright person sees an evil person trying to hustle him, then he gets very angry. His wrath is terrible. A clever person is able to divert his anger and appease it, but an innocent person keeps laughing knowing that no one can effect him.<br>
This is a quality of Lord Śhiva which should definitely come into Sahaja Yogis."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"I have told you about the origin before. Because on the Day of Mahāśhivarātri, when there is a talk about Śhivjī, then it has to begin with origin. <b>How much He is Primordial, means when there is a first manifestation of form of God Almighty.<br>
He is called as Sadāśhiva when He is enlightened from Brahma. That is why the one who is Śhivjī is called as Ādi [Primordial].</b><br>
You see, before the complete manifestation of any tree, its seed has to be seen first, and that is why it has to be called Bīj Swarūpa -- form of the seed.<br>
That is why the <b>glory of Śhiva is very important.<br>
After that, after His manifestation, the power within Him gets Her Form and is called as Ādi Śhakti.</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"I had told that Śhiva Pūjā means more explanation, more understanding, more this thing; because in other Pūjās we do all these mantras, this, that, but <b>in this Pūjā is to know the knowledge, it's God.</b> And to know that you know God itself is so great. Whatever it is -- She may be Mahāmāyā, She may be anything, but I know Her. It cannot be described in one book, it cannot be described in hundred books.<br>
<b>It cannot be described in words, but to know that's God -- after all, that's God, God Almighty. And that gives you that beautiful surrender, where you just feel absolutely secured in that Ocean of Love.<br>
I wish you all to achieve that state.</b><br>
May God bless you. "</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>My only, if I have any, desire is that: try to follow the qualities of Śhrī Mahādeva. How great He is, how detached He is. Detached: absolutely detached.<br>
......<br>
<b>This is My greatest desire</b> and I hope -- I am a person who is desireless -- you will fulfill this subtle desire I have that we should transform the world.<br>
May God bless you."</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we are going to do Pūjā to Śhiva, Śhrī Śhiva.</b><br> 
As you know, Śhrī Śhiva is the reflection of Sadāśhiva within us. I've already told about the reflection. Sadāśhiva is the God Almighty, the One who sees the play of Ādi Śhakti. But He is the Father who is watching each one of His Creation, or Her Creation.<br> 
His support to Ādi Śhakti is entirely, fully, strengthening. There's no doubt in His mind about the capability of the Ādi Śhakti. But when He finds that in the play of Ādi Śhakti, the people or the world as such, try to disturb Her or spoil Her work, then He gets into His wrathful mood, and He destroys all such people, and maybe, He destroys the whole world.<br> 
On one side He's wrathful, no doubt, on the other side, He is the Ocean of Compassion and Joy. That's why, <b>when He's reflected within us, we get our Self-realization, we get the light of our Spirit, and we get into the Ocean of Joy</b>."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Today, we are ready to do Śhrī Śhiva's Pūjā.<br>
It is said about Śhrī Shivjī that He is very easy and very innocent. This is why it's very hard to know Him.<br>
<b>The work of Kuṇḍalinī is the work of Goddess. Goddess is the One who creates this universe and in the end She takes the form of Kuṇḍalinī and helps you to reach Śhrī Śhiva. When you worship Śhrī Śhiva you must remember that, `Did we have Śhrī Śhiva's qualities established within us or not?' That's why first of all we should understand the workings of Kuṇḍalinī.</b><br>
When Kuṇḍalinī is awakened, then foremost it heals your body to health because it is very important for the body to be healthy."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Today we are here to celebrate Mahāśhivarātri.<br>
It's a very great privilege for all of us to understand about Śhrī Mahādeva. Unless and until you have got your Self-realization you cannot understand what is the great personality, the character and the Powers of Śhrī Mahādeva.<br>
Is not easy to conceive, also to reach the depth, of His greatness unless and until we are humble. We have to be very humble to reach at the Lotus Feet of Śhrī Mahādeva.<br>
As you have seen that one has to cross even the Sahasrāra to be at the Lotus Feet of this great personality. He is beyond, beyond all our conception, but He resides in our hearts as the Spirit, and is reflected very well when you get your Realization."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>We pray to Lord Shiva to look after our union. I surrender to You. Now Gauri Kundalini surrenders to the Spirit.<br>
We pray to Lord Shiva to look after this. I forget everything else. I leave it in Your holy hands.<br>
You raise me up. I forget all that was in me before, just lift me up. You raise me up.<br>
Everything I have dropped out, no other desire but just lift me higher. Make me Your servant. The rest of it is not important.<br>
All the other manifestations of this desire are over.<br>
Now I am absolutely surrendered to You, my Spirit. Lift me higher and higher and higher.<br>
Away from all the thoughts and things that were not the spirit. Make me complete Spirit.</b><br>
Forget all that was there. That elevation, that ascent becomes fast quick trip. A very fast thing.<br>
If you just try this every moment, anything that goes against the Spirit must be given up. And that Spirit is what? The pure desire.<br>
We have to be one with the Spirit, and all the rest is not important.<br>
You are in the beautiful Kingdom of God where all ugliness drops out like when the lotus opens out; all the mud drops out from it.<br>
<b>In the same beautiful way, let My children become fragrant beautiful offerings to Lord Sadāshiva.<br> 
May God bless you.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"...... <b>we will give Him what He likes the most: is the belapatra, which is at ... leaf which has got three leaves on one stem. 
Which means: His Three Powers, Triguṇātmika, Threesh Powers.<br>
So, with our Three Powers, our Triguṇās, our Three Powers, we surrender ourselves to Śhiva.<br>
And, by that, we show that: ‘We give our triguṇas to You so that we become Guṇātīt.’<br>
This is what is the Śhiva Pūjā.</b><br>
