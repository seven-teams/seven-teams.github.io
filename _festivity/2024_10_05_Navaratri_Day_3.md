<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now you are worshiping today the Durgā, or all the Nine Forms of the Goddess.</b> She came nine times on this Earth, according to this, that She fought all the people who were destroying the seekers, who were trying to make a mess of their lives. And these tortured Saints, when they prayed to the Goddess -- because none of the Gods could do anything, and Sadāśhiva is never interfering with what the Goddess is doing -- so they worshiped the Bhagavatī, and then the Incarnation of Hers came nine times, according to the need of the time.<br>
So every time you find Her confronting people who are extremely arrogant, self-opinionated, thinking no end of themselves. And the bhaktas are tortured by these self-opinionated horrible rākṣhasas."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Mahālakṣhmī. 

She has Three Powers. She is one is at Mahākālī, with which She is the one who exists, and when She gets angry, She can kill also. That's the point. That's Mahākālī. And from Her two other powers came out. Was Mahāsaraswatī, who is the creative power. And the third one is the evolutionary power, is Mahālakṣhmī."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Now we must understand the Mahākālī is in totality is the reflection of Ādi Śhakti, in totality. Or we can call it that Ādi Śhakti is in charge, She's managing all these Three Powers, but Her manifestation in totality is Mahākālī, in the sense that it is the Desire of God Almighty.<br>
So first She's Ādi Śhakti in charge of all the Three Powers, and that's why we can say that, when She is in a potential stage, She is Mahākālī.<br>
And then She divides Herself into two other forces: as Mahāsaraswatī and the ascending force that we call, or as a parasympathetic nervous system expressed in us is the Mahālakṣhmī Principle.<br>
So She has actually all these forces in Herself. But Kālī has all these forces but She manifests, She desires to act, and when She wants to act Her potential force becomes these two other forces."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font></font> <font color="DarkRed">I say that before going out please take a bandhan. It’s a kavach, we call it a kavach. Means, kavach, in English there’s a word for that?</font><br>
<b>Sahaja Yogis [suggest]:</b> Protection.<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font></font> <font color="DarkRed">That’s rather, protection is abstract, but this is a protection of the Mother is a concrete stuff, you see, kavach. So you take the kavach. Kavach is something you can say that people wear those armor, inside, you see that sort of a thing, is kavach. So you must take that before going out or talking to somebody. That you don’t do.</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So when we do the Pūjā of Mahākālī, we must understand that inbuilt within this force within us is desire.</b><br>
So we can desire anything! If you want you can desire everything: you can desire, say, the joy, we can desire the knowledge, we can desire to be compassionate and love, and we can desire also the destruction of those which are negative forces.<br>
But the Mahākālī Force is the one which is working out the constructive force. But in that constructive force only there has to be destruction. Because if you are constructing something and there is destruction which is trying to destroy your construction, then you have to destroy that destructive person.<br>
And this is what <b>people sometimes misunderstand and they think that Mahākālī Force is negative force or is a force of destruction. It is! But in a very positive way. And if you understand this part of Mahākālī Force then you will understand that if you have desires to construct yourself properly in Sahaja Yoga, then you should also have the desire to destroy whatever is standing against your construction</b>."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"First and foremost thing She does is to protect us. Wherever you may be, whatever you may be doing, in whatever peril you may be, howsoever dangerously you may be placed in life, She protects you. First thing, She protects you.<br>
......<br>
So, when you worship Her, what do you want? You want Her to protect you. In your discrimination, in your mistake, you might do something wrong. May do something that is not good for you, could be very dangerous for you. But She is the person who guides how to avoid all the dangers. Now, She protects your life, She protects your body, She protects all organs of your body, She is the One who gives you all the security of life. 

In Her Realm, you feel completely secure. You are never afraid of anything. Because you have left Her Realm, you have come out of it, that is why -- that is the reason you are afraid. But if you are under Her beautiful guidance and Her blessings, you will never feel afraid to do anything. You will never do anything wrong also. As soon as you'll try to do wrong, She will hold your hand. She is really the guiding person.<br>
<b>She is the One who actually gives us our existence. Without Her, we cannot exist, because She is the One who is the Power of Śhrī Śhiva.</b>"</font><br>
