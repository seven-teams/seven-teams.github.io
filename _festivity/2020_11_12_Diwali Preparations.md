<font color="DarkRed">"<b>I wish you a very, very happy Diwālī.</b>
To see all of you here, is itself such a joy for Me that you all have taken to Sahaja Yoga in such a beautiful way. It’s your own, Self is your own, Spirit is your own, but to take to Self is difficult. It’s only your desires, I think, which is being fulfilled. And that’s how you have got your Self-realization. It cannot be forced, as you know very well. It has to work out only with your desire, only with your surrendering.<br>
No use talking about it. No use convincing about it. What works out is your desire, simple as that. The power of desire within you works it out. There are many, who are not here, who have got their Realization all over the world. I remember all of them, and all of you should remember them. Today is a nice day when we can think of all those who are enlightened in this world. <b>That’s the real Diwālī: the enlightenment of human beings. It’s not candle, it’s not some lamp, but it’s human beings.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>"The first day of Diwālī is called as Dhanatrayodaśhī: is the thirteenth day of the Moon.</b> Because that day is the first day when Lakṣhmī, the first ... was born on the thirteenth day. That means She was born as a Gṛuhalakṣhmī, as a housewife. there are eight Lakṣhmīs, which she will read it now and I will tell you later on what is the meaning of them. Just one of them is Gṛuhalakṣhmī.<br>
<b>So the first is the form of a Gṛuhalakṣhmī. She is born as a Gṛuhalakṣhmī to begin with.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So today’s day is, as I told you, the thirteenth day is the Goddess, Dhanteras it is called, as that is the day of the Gṛuhalakṣhmī</b>; She came as Gṛuhalakṣhmī. In the household, the lady is the one who is the symbol of that Lakṣhmī, to begin with. Because she’s the one who looks after your food, looks after your comfort, she protects you, she nourishes you, she gives you joy. And the women who cannot do that are not Gṛuhalakṣhmī’s, they are not the ... ‘housewife’ is a very poor word for that. They are the gṛuhalakṣhmīs: <b>means they are the goddesses of the family</b>."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Then you have your wife as gṛuhalakṣhmī.</b> So we have to have a wife as gṛuhalakṣhmī. These two things one should understand very, very clearly because we confuse them. Wife is the gṛuhalakṣhmī, is the one, she is the goddess of the household. Now she has to be the goddess also, I mean she just doesn’t become goddess just by becoming. You have to become again. You have to become the goddess. And, the Goddess of the Gṛuhalakṣhmī is, we can say, that the deity of the Gṛuha – of the house – is a Gṛuhalakṣhmī.<br>
Now, this deity must become one with the housewife. Then the blessings of the Lakṣhmī essence is of well-being comes to you. If she is not the Goddess, you will always suffer.<br>
You will always have problems; you will always have all kinds of untold miseries. It is Her blessings which brings you solace, peace and redemption – redemption is the word – of anything. So, that’s why the left Nābhī is very important as we know and that is always bad in the West. So, I would say that the whole society is responsible for spoiling that because housewife is not respected.<br>
First of all, we should blame our society. Our housewives are not respected. Housewife is the one who is a dedicated wife even placed higher than Yatis. Yatis are the highest evolved you can say, Avadhūtas, are the highest evolved seers. And, a dedicated wife has got more powers than even a Yati, it is said so."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"The another symbolic thing about Her is She’s a Mother. <b>And Mother just gives – nirvajya.</b> She doesn’t charge any interest for what She gives. She just gives. Her enjoyment is giving. I mean I always think what should I cook for you? If I can do this, I can buy this, I can buy this present for you. I mean Diwālī is a good day for Me that I can give you so many things that I want to give you. And I love it! Nothing like the joy of giving."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"...... we have to understand that the society is completely dependent on the Gṛuhalakṣhmīs, that means a housewife has to be a very lady of great character, respectability and dignity. Society is her responsibility, she is responsible for creating peace, understanding, and for giving full idea as to what is love.<br>
I think her responsibility is much more difficult, subtler than that of men and she is the śhakti of the family so she should not try to behave in a manner that is not dignified or matured."</font><br>

<font color="FireBrick">"<b>"I would describe it to you that Lakṣhmī is the One who is a Mother by nature.</b><br> 
So a person who has Lakṣhmī, a person who has got wealth must have a motherly benevolent temperament. That’s one thing.<br>
Then another thing is that She stands on the lotus, in the water. So a person who has got Lakṣhmī must stand ... have a balance.<br>
If he moves this side or that side, left or right side he, immediately goes inside the Bhavasāgar.<br>
Secondly, Her one hand is giving and another hand I ... is protection like this. <br>
So, at least a person who has got Lakṣhmī money should be generous, he should be giving.<br>
And right hand he should protect all the people who are working under him or who are related to him, his relations or other things, or any other organizations or anything that he is connected with he should try to patronize it and protect it from all kinds of dangers."</font><br>

Dear All,<br>
Wishing you all a very Happy Diwālī!<br>
Today we begin our 2020 Diwālī Celebrations with Dhanteras, the 13th day of the moon on Nov. 13, when we worship Śhrī Laxmi in Her form of Śhrī Gṛuhalakṣhmī.<br>
On Nov. 14th, unusually, we have Narakachaturdashi and Diwālī Day together. Naraka Chaturdashi falls in the morning followed by Diwālī the same evening.<br>
We are very fortunate to have received our Self-realization from the Divine Mother Herself, the same One Mother, who is the embodiment of all the Shaktis, Devis, Deities, etc., and in particular of all Forms of Lakshmi.<br> 
Let's get together and get full advantage of this auspicious time so that all these Aspects of the Divine we are celebrating are awakening within us and are manifested to bring out the Divine Vision of Śhrī Mataji.
