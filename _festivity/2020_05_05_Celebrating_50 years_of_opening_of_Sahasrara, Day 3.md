<font color="DarkRed">"I have to tell ... I’ll have to tell you the story about the Sahasrāra Day, about which it was decided, long time back, before I incarnated. They had a big meeting in the Heavens, all the thirty-five karoṛs [350 millions] of Gods, the Deities were there present to decide what is to be done. <b>'This is the ultimate that we have to do to human beings: is to open their Sahasrāra, to open their awareness to the Spirit, to the Real Knowledge of the Divine, to remove the darkness of ignorance.'</b> And it had to be spontaneously because it has to work the living force of God. Also it had to be very quick. So all the Gods requested that now, I, the Ādi Śhakti has to take the birth.
They all tried Their best. They did whatever was possible. The Saints were made by Them but very few. They incarnated and people made religions out of Them which were perverted, brought Them bad name. No reality in those religions. These religions were money-oriented or power-oriented. There was no Divine Force working, actually it was all anti-Divine."</font><br>

<b>Vish'weshwari twam paripasi vishwam</b><br>
O Queen of the universe You are its guardian.<br>
<b>Vish'atmika dharayas'iti vishwam</b><br>
In the form of the Universe You are its receptacle.<br>
<b>Vishw'esha vandhya bhavati bhavanti</b><br>
You are worshipped by the lords of the universe.<br>
<b>Vishw'ashraya ye twayi bhakti namraha</b><br>
Those who are devoted to You themselves become supporters of the universe<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>When we enter into the Realm of Sahasrāra, then only we have [a] right to do the Sahasrāra Pūjā.</b> Before this nobody talked about Sahasrāra, nobody did any Pūjā to Sahasrār. This is your privilege that you are in the Realm of Sahasrāra and that you can do this Pūjā, perform it, is your right, you are chosen for this. It’s a very privileged place for you to enter into the Sahasrāra of the Virāṭ, to reside in the brain as cells of that Sahasrāra.<br>
Let us see what is the quality of the cells of Sahasrāra. These are specially created cells through the working of the Swādhiṣhṭhāna. Passing through all the chakras, when they arrive at Sahasrāra they are equipped to handle the brain’s activity without getting involved into other elements in the body.<br>
In the same way, the Sahaja Yogis are not to be involved in the other cells, human beings, of the body of this Universe."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So, we have lost now the sense of aim. We don’t have any aims. We just want to enjoy. It’s a very, very big thing that has happened because, as you know, <b>the joy in the Sahasrāra is Nīra-ānanda, Nīra-ānanda.</b><br>
Of course, Nīra is My name also, but it means pure absolute joy. Nīra-ānanda. And that Nirānanda, that joy has no other hues. It’s just pure, pure joy. Without thinking, it just pours into it. After all, every activity is for what, for getting some sort of a pleasure, sensation and also, some people believe, for joy. It’s not.<br>
<b>Only after the opening of Sahasrāra and the cleansing of it, then you will know what is joy.</b>"</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So here the joy becomes Nirānanda: Absolute Joy, nothing but joy. It’s complete freedom. So you have all kinds of joys, as I told you before: you have Swānanda, the joy of the Spirit, then you have got Brahmānand, the joy of well-being, you’ve got Līlānanda, Kṛiṣhṇānand, where you have the joy of the play. But when you reach <b>the State of Sahasrāra it is Nirānand: means Sheer, Absolute Joy</b>."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"It's a work of Adi Shakti. Try to understand this. It's not work of any saint. It's not work of any incarnation. It's not work of any politician. And not work of any big leader. It is the work of Adi Shakti, which is so transparently showing its results in you.<br>
Now it is for you to see. <b>To please Me is your ardent desire, I know. I see how you love Me and how you want to do for Me. The greatest thing you can do for Me is to spread Sahaja Yoga.</b> [It] is a very special, extremely difficult blessings you have got. You didn't have to do any efforts. You didn't have to pay any money. You don't have to get sick with rituals. You got it spontaneously. But that doesn't mean that it's sort of your birthright to get it. [It] is the work of Adi Shakti. And the work of Adi Shakti has to be shown in your life. [It] is the compassion, without any reward."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Your first and foremost responsibility is Sahaja Yoga. Because you should know what a work it is. Its such a great work, to transform the whole world – that is My vision.</b> And this old age I think the same. Now, if that is My vision, what should be your attitude? That we should go all out to spread Sahaja Yoga.<br>
That’s the main thing. I call you for these Pūjās just to renovate, I should say, to give you more of energy and all that. But if you are just taking it as a great blessings and sitting at home it’s of no use. You must spread Sahaja Yoga!</font><br>
