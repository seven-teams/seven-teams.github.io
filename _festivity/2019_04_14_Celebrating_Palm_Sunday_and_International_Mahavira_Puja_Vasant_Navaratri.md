<font color="DarkRed">"I have told you many a times it is like a donkey, mind is just like a donkey. If you go behind the donkey, it kicks you, it will tell you, that you are the bad man, you are the worst man; all the self-pity will come into you. If you go ahead with the donkey, then he’ll put his ears to you, you can hold him like an ego, you see. You can go wherever you want, do what you like, “What’s wrong?” It will not control you. If you sit on top of the donkey it will still play about with you, to see how you work out."</font><br>

O Divine Mother, You are verily Shri Mahavira. Salutations to You!<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today we have gathered here to do the Pūjā of Mahāvīra. So far I think it’s the first time we are having Mahāvīra Pūjā. The reason was that Mahāvīra’s life was an ascetic’s life, just like Buddha.<br>
......<br>
The ascetic life of Mahāvīra was of a very, very extreme nature. He was the one who was born in a clan of warriors, Kṣhatriyas, and then He was also married. Also He had a daughter and then He decided because He knew He had to do the work of the Divine, He decided to take a saṃnyāsa. So He took the permission of His brother because His parents were dead. He was a king, so He gave up all His material wealth everything and He became a complete saṃnyāsī and He left His family, left His house everything behind and went alone with a little bowl for begging alms. And the people who joined Him were very few and He asked them that you have to also become ascetics, Munis"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="blue">"You must use these two Bīja Mantras to clear out your Āgñyās. But Mahāvīra has a solution for this that after Realization if you catch your Āgñyā, you get a terrible headache. That’s Mahāvīra’s style. You do anything wrong, you get punishment; you indulge into anything, you are punished; you go against Sahaja Yoga, you are punished. I’m not doing anything, it’s Mahāvīra, simultaneously working. If you try to be overly smart, you are outsmarted."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Every minute Sahaja Yogis must know that there is a Mahāvīra sitting round. Also, Buddha is there who gives you an indication that ‘Don’t do this. Do not desire so much.’ He puts limitations to you; but if you don’t listen, then all right, Mahāvīra is there to correct you. Up to a point He goes, then you get headaches, then you say, “Mother, why did I get headaches?” You asked for it. It’s such an automatic machinery that we have to be very careful as Sahaja Yogis.<br>
So, today’s understanding should be that we all should become collective from inside. We should not grudge or grumble about everything and enjoy the collectivity.<br>
But the second side of collectivity is this, that, do not try to exploit the collectivity otherwise you’ll be in trouble."</font><br>
