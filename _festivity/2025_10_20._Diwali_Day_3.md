<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, it's a great day of Diwālī.</b> That means today is the great day of putting up lights of your heart together to make a greater light for the world to move in a proper direction. It's a day of great joy. And those who join in this, are spreading also great joy.<br>
But the problems are there, as they say, but for us there is no problem because theres no darkness. We don't see any darkness anywhere: we see lights, and lights, and lights.<br>
Then what is the m... thing missing there? Missing is our sincerity.<br>
We have to be very sincere with ourselves. Because it is not just a borrowed love or a borrowed joy, but it is from within [that] the source is flowing, flowing and flowing.<br>
So that is to be awakened, and that love should flow, and our small petty things like jealousies and competitions and all those things which spoil us, must be washed away. And it can be washed if your heart is full of love.<br>
Today is a day of spreading love, light of love, so that everybody feels enlightened and happy and [he] forgets his petty problems. "</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So's today we are here to enjoy our joy. Our Ātmānanda, Nirānand and Paramānanda,</b> all these we are here to enjoy, which are of eternal value.<br>
You have to understand that now believe that you are in the Kingdom of God and all the subtle beauties of your being are going to be opened out to you. You are going to see yourself all the beauty. But here, if your eyes are already closed, if your heart is already closed and you don't want to see something that's so beautiful, how can I say what a beautiful thing they have made? Is a very important thing in life, is to have a very positive attitude. For Sahaja Yoga also. In Sahaja Yoga we have to develop ourselves within.</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now you have to enlighten many lights, we call it Dīpawali, Diwālī is dīpāwali, means the rows of lights, and by celebrating this Diwālī with so many of you I'm sure we'll have such a torch of light which will go around the whole world.</b><br>
Just remember you are not a small drop, now you have become the Ocean and you have to spread.<br>
Now you are sitting on your thrones and assume your powers. You have all the powers within you, you have to just manifest it. You have to just feel yourself, understand yourself what is your responsibility.<br>
You have been asking for light now you've got the light, you have become the light, now give light to others.<br>
So achieve a state where your light is on your head, on your Sahasrāra and that it is in your heart, you are not ordinary people, never think that way, actually in Sahaja Yoga only so-called ordinary people will come."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Now we have got, <b>astrologically there are three and a half auspicious days where you don't have to consultant</b> any uh ... any books of astrology, which are called as Pañchāṅg, ......<br>
<b>One of them is today. Is a day you can do anything good, you decide anything good. Today is the day to take an oath, to think of something great, to visualize something big, to ask a boon, to do a big Pūjā, is one of the greatest uh day. One of the, we call them muhūrtas, which where you do not consultant these books.<br>
And that's why rājyābhiṣhek of, I mean the crowning ceremony of Śhrī Rāma took place on this day.</b>"</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Then the fifteenth is that darkest night, that's the darkest night when there is no Moon.<br>
Absolutely that's the day when they celebrate the Diwālī.</b><br>
But symbolically in India also, Śhrī Rāma returned to Dwari - to His [place, Ayodhya] on that day and was crowned on that day.<br>
So the significance of Diwālī is expressed in this manner, that this is the day when Narakāsura, with all of them, are killed, they have all gone to Narak,<br>
they have gone to the Hell, and the people now are safe from them and they are celebrating the joy.<br>
And that is the time when Christ was born.<br>
That's why lights are lit just in the night, `cause He was born at twelve o'clock in the night."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>You know that today is the Pūjā of Śhrī Lakṣhmī.</b> Here nobody performs Lakṣhmī Pūjā. So, it must be understood that today is a very important day. <b>Lakṣhmī gives you everything. She is Mother. She gives everything, all blessings, all comfort, and most important is that She enlightens your inner being.</b><br>
So somehow you recognize Lakṣhmī. Lakṣhmī doesn’t mean money. You have to understand that She is a Goddess, and you have to respect money like a Goddess. In our country, people do a lot for the sake of money; wrong things that are very bad. But you have got a responsibility to recognize Lakṣhmī as Devī, and worship Her and understand that you cannot make fun of Lakṣhmī. Lakṣhmī blesses you and will go on blessing you. Such evil people are a few only, and you should be contented that Lakṣhmī resides in your being and has accumulated many moments of joy and comfort for you. You are going to get all that and have already got it.<br>
...... <b>I am sure that everyone will worship Lakṣhmī, and in the Lakṣhmī Pūjā, one should understand all forms of Lakṣhmī and what Her nature is. We cannot understand Her, and if we cannot understand Her, we will follow the wrong path. So it should be understood that She is Devī and that She is your Mother, and that She can do anything for you because She is very powerful and very affectionate, She doesn’t give you any problem.<br>
If you get trapped somewhere, She will save you. Such is the blessing of Lakṣhmī.</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Lakṣhmī is the Goddess, is the power within us, by which we balance, lead a very balanced life, by which we are satisfied.</b><br>
Now they have made a beautiful picture of this Lakṣhmī also one should understand this power -- is a Lady, is a Mother and She stands on a lotus. Now these are all symbols which suggest that these symbols are carved out with such deep significance. She stands on a lotus. Means imagine, who can stand on a lotus? And She's a very healthy woman, very healthy woman and She stands on a lotus. It means that, that She is never putting pressure on anyone.<br>
......<br>
Then, it has got two red, <b>pink flowers in the hand, that are lotus flowers again.<br>
Now the lotus is regarded as a very holy flower in India, because it is so receptive to everything that is crude and funny.</b> First of all it is born in the mud. Just think of it, in the mud, in the filth, where the horrible smell is coming out, the lotus is born. And the one lotus gives the fragrance, the beautiful fragrance to the whole atmosphere, and kills all that's filth and everything, and covers the whole pond with its big, big leaves so that it looks a beautiful pond. That's what is the lotus for.<br>
But this lotus is a pink lotus, means pink, you know, is the sign of love.</font> <font color="Pink"><b>Pink is the sign of love. So such a person has to have tremendous love and that softness of the lotus.</b>"</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">Śhrī Rāma's crowning or any other aspect of Śhrī Lakṣhmī here now becomes your own crowning, that is now you have entered into the Kingdom of God and once you are there then automatically as the citizens of God's Kingdom you are blessed and as you become the lotuses then you start spreading your fragrance all around. Now you do not keep this joy to yourself but you become generous about it and you go all out to give it to others. Generosity at another level, at a lower level is transformed into this Universal Love. Whatever you gain, whatever joy, satisfaction, vibrations, knowledge, all that you want to give it to others. You want to spread it because now you got the reality and you don't want to keep it to yourself, you think it is very important that everyone in the world should know about reality.<br>
This is significant in putting these lights, that now you are the lights. It is the darkest night today, tonight is the darkest night, in the same way these are the darkest days, this is the Kali Yuga and it is the core Kali Yuga, the worst time where the worst things are happening, human beings are going to the worst level and at this time we have to put Sahaja Yoga before them. You know what is the ordeal one has to go through to break the hard nuts of the brains of people, but it is working, it has clicked already. ......<br>
Now you have to enlighten many lights, we call it Dīpawali, Diwālī is dīpāwali, means the rows of lights, and by celebrating this Diwālī with so many of you I'm sure we'll have such a torch of light which will go around the whole world. Just remember you are not a small drop, now you have become the Ocean and you have to spread. Now you are sitting on your thrones and assume your powers. You have all the powers within you, you have to just manifest it."</font><br>
