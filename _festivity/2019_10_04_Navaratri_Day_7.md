<font color="DarkRed">"Tonight we have gathered here to do the Pūjā to the Devī, that is Mahākālī we can call Her, or Durgā. So many types of forms She has taken, to kill the negative forces that are trying to trouble or to obstruct, or even to grow the people who were gentle and good.<br>
Her forms are of different types – that we know about, that She destroyed so many rākṣhasas, She destroyed so many evildoers."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"We decided to have this Pūjā of Durgā today that all negativity should be destroyed. So many Deities build up the body of Kālī. Every part of Her body was created by a Deity, looked after by a Deity, and is also, later on, is reflected in you all. So they say that God has made human beings in His own image, I would say, I’ve made you in My own image, all the Deities at your disposal. They’re all with you, and they have created you – if you see it minutely – it is the Deities who have brought forth all the beauty that you had. They have made all this beautiful congregation, beautiful transformation, and they have created such angelic people out of you. They are always working it out, but one thing you have to do is to have the drive. You had pure desire to ascend, but for what? You want to have the light, but for what? You want to become gurus, for what? To save people, for their salvation. Only through your channels, I can work out Sahaja Yoga. If I could work out Myself, I would have. It’s not a question of killing one rākṣhasa. God knows how many there are, rākṣhasas and rākṣhasas. And they are everywhere, even within you they were. Now they’ve gone out.<br>
So you have to do full justice to Sahaja Yoga, that’s very important."</font><br>

You are the primordial cause of everything<br>

You are the dark might of periodic dissolution<br>
You are the great night of final dissolution and the terrible night of delusion<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today, first of all we have to establish our desire within ourselves that we are seekers and that we have to achieve our full growth and maturity. Today’s Pūjā is for the whole universe. The whole universe should be enlightened with your desires. Your desires should be so intense that they should emit out the pure vibrations of Mahākālī Śhakti, which is the pure desire of attaining the Spirit. That’s the real desire. All the other desires are like mirage.<br>
You are the people who are chosen by God. Specially, first to express your desire, and then to achieve it. And by intense desire of purity you have to purify the whole world. Not only the seekers, but even those who are not seekers. You have to create an aura around this universe, of desire to achieve the Ultimate, the Spirit."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Her security is so great, She is so secure Herself, that She gives you all the security that you need. You can hold on to Her Feet. You can hold on to Her image or to anything. You can even pray to Her. Many people are being cured only by praying to Her. Because She cures you. She can cure your diseases – which are very complicated diseases – She can cure.<br>
Now what She likes? Mahākālī likes the light. She is worshiped in the night, because then we can put on the light. She likes enlightened persons. Also She likes the light. She likes the Sun. She likes something that will be completely enlightened and brightened."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"She has a double role all the time, she's at two extremes. On one side she is full of joy, giver of joy, she's very happy when she sees Her disciples are joyous. Joy is her own quality, is her energy.....
Sahaja Yoga, as you know, has a double action, as the Mahakali has a double action. She's extremely loving, full of joy, full of happiness and She's the one who's extremely cruel, wrathful, She's the one who's the slayer of all the demons and the evil, and those people who try to do evil."</font><br>
