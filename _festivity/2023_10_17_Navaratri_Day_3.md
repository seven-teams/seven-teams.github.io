<font color="DarkRed">"Now, when we are <b>celebrating the greatest of greatest this Navarātri</b>, there must be something special about it, that we have to cleanse this heart completely, fully and make it so pure that it purifies all the blood that passes through the whole of the body. So the cells of this heart, which has made this great organ, has to be the best, because the cells of the heart within a human body are the best cells, the highest quality, the most sensitive. And it's the heart that expresses the Anāhata, the sound that is without percussion.<br>
......<br>
...... <b>this is the highest Pūjā, the greatest ritual, which you can attend</b>. So why do we do Navarātri? In the heart, to do Navarātri is to accept the Powers of the Śhakti, to realize the power that all these chakras have got in themselves, and that when they are enlightened how you can express all these powers of these Nine Chakras within ourselves; the seven chakras plus the heart and the Moon makes it nine."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So many powers Mother has to have to protect Her children and to look after them.</b> These powers are all there, working relentlessly all the time, twenty-four hours. So anybody who surrenders to Mother, these powers express themselves and try to help you out of your problems. But <b>first thing is surrendering. If you are not surrendered, if you are not in the Kingdom of the God, then this is not the responsibility of the Mother</b>. Then it might be that some negative force might take over and may destroy you."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"But <b>all these powers are nothing but the Power of God's Love. So, in the series of this Great Love of God, Ādi Śhakti had to first become the Power of Desire.</b><br>
In the same way, Sahaja Yogis who are bestowed with this Power of Love have to have full desire in their heart. Desire to love. That desire is very different from the other kinds of human love we have known. In other kinds of human love, when we have relations with others, we have expectations, and that's why it is very disappointing."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"This was a binding love. She could not escape it. <b>Mother's Love is binding. She cannot escape it. And She has to manifest it, work it out, and give that protection to all Her children.</b><br>
This protection in the modern times has taken another form.<br>
In those days, the evil was trying to harm, to destroy the people who were righteous, who were bhaktas, who were doing good things, who wanted to lead a very religious life. So <b>to save them, She incarnated. To protect them, She incarnated.</b> But they knew what was good, they knew what was wrong. And they wanted to preserve their good life, their precious life. They didn't care for money, they didn't care for power, but just they wanted their life, means they wanted to be alive to worship the Goddess. And when they were troubled or harmed or destroyed by these evil forces, She had to manifest.<br>
But in modern times, it's become very complicated, as the modern times are complicated. First of all, in the mind, in the lifestyle, in the society, of good human beings, righteous human beings, fear of the wrong has entered.<br>
Like, they are afraid, say, of their pries-sts [priests], of their churches, of their temples, of their mosques, which are all false! They are not afraid of God.<br>
They don't believe in God. They think that they have created God, and they can manage God. `So who is God?' The way they behave, you can see clearly, that they do not recognize the existence of God, God Almighty who is a wrathful God. They are not at all worried as to what will happen to them."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>But the greatest power that is belonging to the Mother is your protection.</b> Protection from all kinds of things – all the left hand side protections are there. They are described, as you must have learnt on the Devī Māhātmyam – what a protections She gives you. So tremendous in Her protecting power. And this protecting power gives you understanding – how kind She is and how, I should say, how very-very protective, extremely protective. She’ll guide you all the time that you should be protected – on the left side. And through Her Ganas She looks after you."</font><br>
