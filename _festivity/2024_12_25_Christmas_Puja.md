<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Happy Christmas to you all!</b><br>
<b>May God bless you.</b><br>
......<br>
The birth of Christ is celebrated all over the world, and is nice that we are celebrating here, at Gaṇapatīpuḷe, His birth. As you know very well, in Sahaja Yoga we have realized that the Principle of Christ was Śhrī Gaṇeśha. So this is the right place to celebrate the Christmas and the Birth of Christ. Is the ... absolutely it coincides today and I am very happy that you have chosen Gaṇapatīpuḷe for that. "</font><br>

You already know how He came on this Earth, and what was His great work. But we must see to the subtle side of Christ, what was His Power? Christ['s] Power was of course Oṃkāra. His Power was Praṇava. But the essence of Christ was tapasyā, tapasvitā. He is the Incarnation of Tapasyā. And in that Incarnation, He's a sinless personality."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"It is written in the Devī Māhātmyam about the birth of Christ who was the Son of Rādhā, and that Rādhā was also Mahālakṣhmī. He was born in another state [apart from a human womb], and within an egg, half of which incarnated as Śhrī Gaṇeśha and the other half became Mahāviṣhṇu who is our Lord Jesus Christ. So Jesus Christ and Mahāviṣhṇu are one and the same Deity. When Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī came upon this Earth She brought forth Her Child by the Immaculate Conception which She had previously done as Śhrī Rādhā. Jesus Christ is the Son of the Great Being of the Virāṭa. Viṣhṇu was the Viṣhṇu Tattwa [the Ādhāra or the Support of the Virāṭa] so Mahāviṣhṇu became the Virāṭa is also called the Akbar [the Greatest Person].<br>
At His Ascent Jesus Christ arose above the earth and the other elements and became the Oṃkāra who is the Source and the Support of the Vibrations. All the other Incarnations of the Deities had to take Their Principles from the essence of the Mother Earth itself when their bodies were created.<br>
......<br>
<b>If a Pūjā had been done to Christ whilst He was living, then they would have also done a Pūjā to His Mother, Śhrī Mary. In the Commandments given to Śhrī Moses it is written ``whatever is created by the Heavens and by the Earth should not be recreated, reproduced and worshiped" [Thou shalt not have false idols before me] as the Incarnations are created by the Heavens. It is only in modern times that it is possible to take a Photograph of the Incarnations. In former days this was not possible.</b> Whatever has been created by the Mother Earth and taken out of the Mother Earth these are the swayambhus. We find the swayambhus [self-existent marks or signs of God Almighty found in nature] are not made by human hands. Everywhere realized Souls have also made some beautiful statues."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"So, they say 'Merry Christmas' is enjoyment for joy. Out of peace comes the joy, the light of joy, the happiness.</b><br>
I wish peace for the whole world, for the whole nation, to understand to give up all the strives, all the false battles, for money and for power, all wrong ideas that they are different from each other, and come under the banner of Sahaja Yoga and enter into the Kingdom of God, where they are invited with all respect and love.<br>
I wish peace to all of them, to all the countries, all the human beings: in their families, in their hearts, with their children, with all of them. Let there be peace, let their heart emit peace, their tongues speak with peace, their eyes see nothing but peace.<br>
All this has to change, tremendous change has to take place. ......<br>
<b>I bless all of you to be the channels of that peace, to be beautiful channels of that peace, to be glorious channels of that peace, to be great children of your Mother, who is so proud of you.<br>
May God bless you."</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>From His childhood to His death He was jolly person, He was happiness, He was joy. To make you all happy, to give you the light of happiness by enlightening your Source of Joy, that is your Spirit in your heart. That He came on this Earth -- not only to save you -- first to give you happiness, to give you joy.</b><br>
......<br>
Then He comes there, like a morning flower, to make you happy. First to make you happy, to give you joy. You see any child ... You see any child at least I know Myself, I don't know about the funny people here I mean, for them flowers also look like thorns, I mean I don't know how they manage that stuff. But you see a child anywhere, any child, such a joy-giving thing it is. And this is the Child of the Divine -- that comes on this Earth as a Child -- is the most joy-giving thing. And that's why Christmas for all of us, for the whole Universe should be a festival of great joy. For He brought light for us by which you could see that there is someone called as `God'. There is someone, who is going to remove this ignorance. This was the first beginning.<br>
<b>So, for us, it is necessary to be first joyous and be happy and relaxed, and not to take anything that seriously as we take. Because divine life doesn't make you serious.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"It was a living example of a very Great Advent that He came on this Earth and led such a pure and a holy life.<br>
<b>Try to develop your purity and holiness, and a powerful holiness and a powerful auspiciousness, which does not get contaminated, but fights whatever is anti-God, whatever is anti-Christ.</b><br>
So today is a day when you are celebrating His birthday again. And on this day, let Him be born within us! Let Him be born in our character, in our behavior, in our temperament.<br>
He was a detached man, not attached to material things, nothing of the kind."</font><br>

Now, it is for you people to bring back the Glory of Christ, to bring back the Dharma of Christ, to reflect the great image of Christ.<br>
When people say that you had no ideals, I'm amazed! Who could be a better ideal than Jesus Christ?"<br>

<b>Today you have to ask just one thing from Me, that, 'O Mother, today we ask You to give us that power of uh-uh-uh penance, of tapasyā of Christ.' I wish this would be granted today and you will become tapasvi[n]s.<br>
