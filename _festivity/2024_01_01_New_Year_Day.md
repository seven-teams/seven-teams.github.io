<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, again, is a New Year's Day.<br>
Uh every new year comes because we have to take to something that is new. It has been so arranged that the Sun has to move for three hundred and sixty-five [365] days and again a new year has to come.</b><br>
Actually the whole solar system is moving in a spiral way. So, there is definitely a higher, higher state, of this solar system. Every year it is rising higher in a spiral way. So it is not only that: it is because three hundred and sixty-five [365] days have passed because it has moved a step forward, higher than whuh ... what it was.<br>
Now, we can see that in awareness, human beings have definitely risen much higher than what they were, say, about two thousand years back.<br>
But the first system that started, the whole universe was the first model, one can say, was created. And that model has to be perfect. And that was a perfect model, which then started perfecting the rest of it. So that is the perfect model which is in the Principle of this Ascent, and that is working out this ascent.<br>
Now, the perfection of the rest of the universe takes place in various directions. But today we have to consider the Mahālakṣhmī Principle.<br>
Now Mahālakṣhmī, as I told you, is a perfect principle. Is a perfect principle, it's perfect in it. It's born as perfect, will remain as perfect, will be always eternally perfect. So, that is not necessary to be corrected."</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"So, for today's New Year, <b>let us vow within ourselves, that the selfishness or the self-centeredness or the smallness in you is finished.</b> Now the drop has become the ocean. Live like an ocean and like a lion. Don't roar at others, I mean [be] generous and don't be afraid of anything. Everything is taken care of, but believe that everything is taken care of. Sometimes you might feel you are let down, sometimes you'll feel, "Oh, this should have happened." Do not desire for anything! Whatever is your desire is not correct, that's all. If the desire is correct and is deserving, it will happen -- hundred per cent [guaranteed]!<br>
So all the best, and the greatest year, and happiness and joy.<br>
Feel your responsibility, understand each other. And now I'm going, tomorrow I'll be gone, so-called. [Laughter.]<br>
Don't worry about anything else but worry about the Sahaja Yoga that has to be established all over the world. Very great work one has done."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So today is a day of a new year and we should think why do we have new years -- what is the need to have a new year? We want something new that you start something afresh to ourselves, to others, to your Mother, to your Guru. That you have to get out of the clutches of ignorance and darkness. That you have to get out of the bondages of ego. That you have to become absolutely a free glorious personality. And that you have to fight the superego influences and all the bad conditionings should be thrown as torn clothes and should wear new beautiful clothes of Sahaja Yogis.<br>
Let all the people, let all the Sahaja Yogis raise their voices from the top of their houses and top of their mountains, the top of their higher positions. Broadcast to the whole world, inform the whole people that you have found the Truth and everybody has to find the Truth, otherwise there is no escape. That you have found the joy and that everyone has to find it and everybody must work to get to it."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"So then, everybody should, today, decide and take an oath, that, 'We'll do everything to spread Sahaja Yoga with humility.' "</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we are going to worship Mahālakṣhmī Principle within us.</b><br>
As you know very well that Mahālakṣhmī Principle resides in the central path of our being, through which Kuṇḍalinī has to rise. But Kuṇḍalinī enters into our body through the left side. In the sense that is the residual power of creating everything, left side, right side, and then She enters into our sacrum bone.<br>
So, in the Mahālakṣhmī temple, in Kolhapur, they sing a song of Kuṇḍalinī Ambe that, "Oh Ambā, please rise," "Kuṇḍalinī, please rise." In the Mahālakṣhmī temple they have to do it because through Mahālakṣhmī channel only She rises.<br>
Now the Mahālakṣhmī Principle within us starts manifesting when our Lakṣhmī Principle is complete. Mahālakṣhmī Principle is to ascend above all material seekings."</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"So today the <b>first and the foremost vow is</b>, as I told you, that we have to get cleansed up in such a way that we become free of ego and superego. We should get rid of our ignorance and darkness. <b>And the second vow as I have said</b> that you have to become the light to remove the darkness and ignorance of others. By sharing My problems, by sharing My anxieties about them -- those who are lost -- and not to be involved into your own personal anxieties and petty things. My problems should be your problems now because you all belong to Me, to My body, to My being.<br>
And I request you to join hands with Me, with full determination and complete attention and the heart of a lion."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>This Mahālakṣhmī Principle when manifests in your Sahasrāra, then there are no words that one can express how it brings a divine light in you.</b> You know you are knowing the Truth, you know it very well. You know what is reality. You are so knowledgeable. Still you don't look down upon people who are ignorant. So in Sahasrāra it manifests compassion, tremendous compassion. Now one may say how can brain have compassion? But the Kuṇḍalinī comes out of the Heart center. That Heart center enlightens your heart and the first thing that shows in you is the feeling of tremendous compassion. You don't worry about yourself, you do not think about yourself, you all the time you are thinking about others' Realization. And as soon as you start paying attention to that, that person gets all right. You are on solid grounds and you are so confident but at the same time we are extremely humble, kind and gentle."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Whenever a new year starts, then a new thing, a new concept, a new understanding awakens inside a human being. It automatically happens. Whosoever started the concept of new year must have been a great visionary so that on this occasion symbolically, inside human beings a new ambition, a new thought, a new revolution should awaken. Like today many new years have come and gone, new ambitions came, new concepts came and finished."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Every moment is a New Year for a Sahaja Yogi because he lives in the present and neither in future nor in the past gone by. For him every moment is a New Year, a new surge of joy (umang), a new wave.<br>
Just as one, while already swimming in the Ocean of Love is lovingly tossed every moment by the love all around, so also every Sahaja Yogi is to live in complete joy (ānand), love (prem), peace (śhānti) and blissful delight (āhlād). The question is whether we have learnt to swim thus.<br>
......<br>
Only he should be called a Sahaja Yogi who has achieved complete satisfaction and tranquility [samādhān] and his pure desire has been fulfilled.<br>
......<br>
He should now enjoy the supreme and unique bliss of his immense capacity to give this to others."</font><br>
