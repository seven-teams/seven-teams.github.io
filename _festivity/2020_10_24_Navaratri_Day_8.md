<font color="DarkRed">"<b>But this Pūjā is to be done with full understanding, and with full recognition that it’s a great fortune. Even the Devas are jealous of you, all the Ṛiṣhis are jealous of you, so many people are jealous of you. The greatest advantage for you, greatest fortune.</b> Make full use of it. And they are very simple things that can please, very simple. You know your Mother can be pleased with very, very simple things. It’s like that only. It’s how much heart you have put into it, is the point. I think tomorrow we should have the Pūjā, today we have understood about it. It is more to be felt and understood and realized than to be thought about. Because you’ll go into thoughtless awareness. It is more source of triggering."</font><br>

<b>Salutations to the Devī, to the Mahādevī. 
Salutations always to Her who is ever auspicious.<br>
Salutations to Her who is the Primordial Cause of the sustaining power. With attention we have made obeisance to Her.<br>
Salutations to Her who is terrible, to Her who is eternal.<br>
Salutations to Gaurī, the supporter of the universe.<br>
Salutations only to Her who is of the form of the moon and moonlight, and happiness itself.<br>
We bow to Her who is welfare.</b><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is the eighth day of Navarātri, but it is great day for Sahaja Yogis because it is the most important period. That is, the seventh center we have crossed and we are on the eighth center.</b> We need not think of the Goddess what She did on the eighth day, we have to think today what we have to do within ourselves.
After crossing the seventh day, after crossing the seventh chakra – that is the real ascent in your spiritual ascent. What are we to do on the eighth one?<br>
It’s so Sahaja that today should be Aṣhṭamī, because that is the day the Goddess killed so may evil doers, and demons and rākṣhasas. She did it on Her own, alone. Now these evil forces are manifesting in human beings. They have spread out. They are within us. So <b>we all have to fight those forces within us</b>.<br>
The war is within ourselves, is not without. First when you ascend the seventh chakra, when you are on the eighth step, you have to remember first you have to fight those forces within ourselves."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"All of you, all of you, are in My Heart, and I love you very much, and I want you people to come as soldiers to fight with Me.  I am also told that there are some people who are forming groups – extremely negative attitude! At this time what we need is complete solidarity. So, all such people whom you see, tell them to behave themselves!  No use making them Sahaja Yogis.<br>
<b>I am sure – it’s really heartfelt – desire of mine that you should become really soldiers of love and peace.</b> Because that is why you are here, you are born here for that. So, enjoy yourself."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So today on this day of Aṣhṭamī, which is a very powerful day, <b>you assume that power within yourself that, 'I can fight all these horrible diseases within myself. And for others I will have compassion and love.</b>
I will have not other.’<br> 
This is the point we miss always. They think, 'Mother is giving lectures to others not to me.'<br>
And that compassion will bring forth the beauty of Sahaja Yoga."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Sahaja Yoga is the Power of Compassion and Love of God Almighty.</b> But it’s not just talk, just not giving you a lecture or a sermon, but it is actualization of the experience of this Divine Love. It is Spirit-oriented, not money-oriented, nor is power-oriented. All the religions have failed outside because they are not Spirit-oriented. Now, of course, they are challenging us and saying all kinds of wrong things about us because they are frightened that they will be exposed.
But Truth will prevail now. The time has come for Truth to prevail. It is surprising that people don’t understand that Truth is Love and Compassion. If you really love somebody, you know everything about that person, that is how the Divine Love is, which knows everything about everything. It is the knowledge that you get when you fall into the Ocean of Love, an Ocean, you fall into the Love’s Ocean. One has to know that Truth is what Truth is, you cannot change it, because it is absolute. You cannot transform it, you cannot sell it. You cannot pay for it. It has to be really understood that if you have to know the Truth you will know because the time has come, and that you are the human beings at the epitome of evolution."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>The power of compassion is the power of God, which is the All-pervading Power</b>, which acts, which thinks, which understands, which connects, which redeems, which completely transforms you. That is what is compassion is."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"You have to see that all the negativity goes away, around us, around the universe.<br> 
<b>So first we sing the praise of the Goddess; when She destroyed every negative, satanic incarnation of Mahiṣhāsura.</b><br>
And when he was killed, all the Gods praised Her for saving them from the ... from the destruction, and that happened long, long time back – it was ten thousand years back.<br> 
So this is the praise of the Gods of that so that, whatever is the negativity, through those mantras will go away, because it surrounds us – you see that, all of them have been there coming; from ten thousand years they have been coming.<br>
But this is the way you can throw them out of the present into their proper places."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Once you become the Spirit, means when you become the light what you do exactly is to give the light. 
But before that there are lots of hurdles, like as <b>I told you there’s cancer, this, that, all kinds of diseases that hurt human beings. There are mental diseases, there are emotional problems, there are all kinds of problems and they can only be solved if you go to your roots ......<br>
...... We have neglected our roots very much and that’s the reason today we also find people suffering from terminal diseases and all kinds of trouble.<br>
That is one of the first worry for Me that everyone should be healthy and that health comes to you not from outside, from inside.</b> Because supposing if on a tree you find a leaf is sick and you start treating the leaf, you don’t treat the tree. You don’t treat the disease at all. But if you have some means of entering into the roots, you treat the whole of that tree very well, very easily in a very simple manner. In the same way if you can somehow reach your roots, you can treat yourself without much difficulty, without any medicine also."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"...... tobacco which is against ...... It’s a virus. <b>Tobacco is nothing but a kind of a virus, is a kind of a vegetable which has gone out of the circle of evolution.</b>
But He [Śhrī Kabīra] has put it Surati for Kuṇḍalinī while people use this word surati for tobacco very openly.<br>
This shows how we have misused all these Great Incarnations and all their great teachings."</font><br>
