<font color="DarkRed"><b>"Pūjā is one of the things by which you can excite the forms into formless. Now, your centers are the centers of energies. But they, too, have a guiding Deity sitting on all these chakras. They are also the formless made into forms. And when you do the Pūjā, the forms melt into Formless Energy, and this Formless Energy then starts flowing, and that then blows the wind. [Everyone laughs as the wind blows with a noise.] And that's how this misidentification, superimpositions on the Spirit are removed.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>The second power you see on the right-hand side</b>, yellow one, <b>is the power to create. This has called as Mahāsaraswatī Power.</b> In the Sanskrit language these are expressed much clearly, we can call it the creative power. <b>The Creative Power of God descends within us through this and is effective in giving us creative powers: of thinking power, of mental effort, and physical effort. So we put in our mental and physical efforts through this power, which is called as Mahāsaraswatī Power.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we have the idea to do Saraswatī's Pūjā.</b> [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] I have seen that here people worship Mahākālī and Saraswatī, people worship Devī and people are simple natured. We should worship Saraswatī as well.<br>
Saraswatī's work is very great. First, Mahāsaraswatī created the entire universe. The earth element is special in this. The earth element has been placed in such a way between the Sun and the Moon that any living work can easily happen on it. From this living work, slowly and gradually human beings have been generated.<br>
But we should know our own great power. That power is what we call creation power, it's also called creativity.<br>
<b>This creation power is the blessing of Saraswatī by which many arts have been generated. The evolution of art is due to the blessings of Saraswatī.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Śhāradā, the Goddess of Saraswatī</b> is the One who carries the message of Virāṭa within and tells us how to sing. She tells us what is appealing to God. How these rāgas were made also? Just think of it. Because first they chose the notes, the āroha [crescendo] and avarohas [decrescendos], the going up and down [ascending melody and descending melody], which was appealing to God. So the melodies were created. Melodies are fixed. You cannot change the melodies the notes because they found out that, at this point, the Spirit awakened; on the vibrations they found out. They found out that, when they sang this way it worked out. The vīṇā [Primordial Instrument of Śhrī Saraswatī] they played and they found out the exact swaras. Exact swaras which would really make you feel nice. Now, you know that, those people have come from the West, don't understand any Indian music on the mental level but they understand at the spiritual level because their Spirits get filled with joy and the vibrations starts flowing."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"The second power, which He gave us, which He sent to us, was Mahāsaraswatī and to this Mahāsaraswatī Power, 
<b>He called Counselor, the one who will counsel you – that means, who helps us for Yoganirūpaṇ [to see the form of Yoga].</b> 
With the help of this second power, we will get Gyān [Knowledge], we will know the subtle knowledge."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>And She is a person of humility, so the person who is a learned has to be humble.</b> If he is not humble, then he's not learned according to the Principle of Saraswatī. She has -- the person who is very much learned has to bow down with the fruits of his learnings, so that a person who is learned and thinks no end of himself is a person who has not yet learned fully, is a half-baked person and that's why a[n] egoist cannot be a learned man. Learned man is always extremely humble. That is the sign, because <b>She is the Power which gives you humility, not humility of a businessman but a genuine humility She gives you.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Those who keep overbusy all the time, they become right-sided. Such people get disconnected from Lord Śhiva and then He shows His Powers.<br>
<b>You know it already that Goddess Saraswatī is the sister of Lord Śhiva. The worshipers of Saraswatī, the people who are busy in acquiring knowledge, those who are keen seekers of art, should know that She is the sister of Lord Śhiva, that sister's relationship is very important. If you try to go against Her, create impure literature or bad books and thus misuse your knowledge, then Lord Śhiva punishes you with heavy hand. His sister is very important to Him and going against Her is a terrible sin.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Only the Sahaja Yogis, those who are enlightened people, can worship Mahāsaraswatī.</b><br>
Otherwise, people can only worship Saraswatī because, with worship of Saraswatī, you can read books, you can uh-uh-uh create dances, music for the amusement of human beings. But actually, the Saraswatī Pūjan is meant for uh people of ordinary uh-uh-uh awareness, means: ordinary or normal human awareness.<br>
<b>But for Sahaja Yogis, it is the Mahāsaraswatī which is to be worshiped.<br>
As I have told you this Mahāsaraswatī becomes the Viṣhṇumāyā. And She is Viṣhṇumāyā, so you have to be person that you should, yourself, should inform people, like the Viṣhṇumāyā does, what Sahaja Yoga is with your fiery talks, with things of exciting them, telling them, 'What are you up to?'</b>"</font><br>
