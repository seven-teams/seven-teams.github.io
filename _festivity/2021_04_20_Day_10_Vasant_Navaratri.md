<font color="DarkRed">"<b>We have gathered here on the occasion of Rām Navamī.</b> Everybody has said, “Mother please tell us about Śhrī Rām.”<br>
You know that Śhrī Rāma has a very important place on our chakra, He is situated on our right Heart. Śhrī Rāma has taken the place of father hence if there is lack in the responsibility or love from father this chakra is caught. In Sahaja Yoga we to understand that Śhrī Rāma and all other Deities have taken the form to fulfill their divine work, in all Śhrī Rāma had a special task. As it was said by Socrates that the Benevolent King has to come the same way Śhrī Rāma had come on this Earth as benevolent king, He came in the form of human being, He even forgot that He was Incarnation of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, forgot about Him but for all world, He was Puruṣhottama Rāma.<br>
In Sahaja Yoga we need to know when we pray any Deity, we have imbibed the specialties and qualities of the particular Deity within us, Śhrī Rāma had many qualities.<br>
You all know his childhood life and you have already heard about his qualities, he was Puruṣhottama he had another quality that in his ruling, he did not care for his wife or children’s in front of his subjects view."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>On the night of Full Moon, you should meditate on Śhrī Rāma and surrender yourself to Him for protection.</b><br>
The meaning of the word rāmachandra is ‘creativity'. You should completely dedicate your creative powers to Him.<br>
Thus you have to take special care of yourself on these two days.<br>
However, <b>on the seventh (Saptamī) and ninth (Navamī) days of Lunar fortnights, you have My special blessings.</b><br>
Remember that you are specially blessed by Me on these two days.<br>
Make some special arrangements so that you can have proper meditation on these days."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="blue">"<b>Śhrī Rāma was also a great Devī bhakta, that is, devotee of Śhakti.</b> Before attacking Sri Lanka He performed Devī Pūjā for which He needed a Brahmin for conducting various rites to please the Devī. He then sent for Rāvaṇa the King of Sri Lanka, who was a Brahmin and Devī bhakta. He readily responded and helped Śhrī Rāma in performing the Pūjā of the Devī with all nine types of rites."</font><br>

<font color="Indigo">"Śhrī Rām was the ideal husband whereas Śhrī Sītājī was an ideal wife and the children born to them, known as Lav and Kuśha, were also the ideal sons. Śhrī Rāma wanted to establish the high ideas to be emulated by humanity. Socrates, as you all know called Him a benevolent king.<br>
Actually, all the events that occurred in the life span of Śhrī Rāma like Ahilyā Uddhār [Deliverance of Ahalyā], Mokṣha to [Ādivāsin woman Śhabarī], killing of Bali, who was the king of monkeys, who was doing adharma, as well as the killing of Rāvaṇa because he kidnapped Śhrī Sītājī, to establish the Rule of Dharma. Actually, Śhrī Rāma was Dharmātīta, i.e., beyond Dharma. But strictly speaking, Dharma was in-born in Him, i.e., He should be called Dharmasthita. <b>He was the Embodiment of Dharma.</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="Indigo">"<b>Shrī Rāma was the Puruṣhottama – means He was the best among all the human beings. That means He incarnated as a human being, total human being, showing all the qualities of human beings.</b> Like He was, He married the Lakṣhmī principle that was Sītā, and then also He lived a normal married life. When He gave Her up He lived like an ascetic to show how a man should lead his life in proper dharma as a married man. And even when the wife has gone away, how He was leading a life of complete chastity."</font><br>

of proper judgment, fair play, and righteousness.<br>
<b>If the king is not righteous then your collective goodwill will go against the king."</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Śhrī Rāma came on this Earth to establish the institution of benevolent king.</b> The political development and the political evolution started from this [right] side. <b>He is the one who gave leadership as a benevolent king, the one who represents God and who is a king. The idea of a king related to God came from Śhrī Rāma.</b> But the modern kings are not like that, they have no relation with God.<br>
On the contrary, they are horrid people. Some of them are nothing but satanic people, absolutely Satan is there and you can see from the way they lead their lives, and they have led their life before. So the benevolence of Śhrī Rāma is here [shows the right Heart] to be followed by all the political leaders and all the people who are at the helm of affairs. He is the ideal that was created for human beings, to run their authority as the head, or the loving compassionate benevolent leader of the people, who has to govern them by making them respectful, by respect. And if human beings create such things who are not respectable, those who have no human values, those who have no moral courage, those who are selfish, those who are self-centered, then they have nothing to do to be there.<br>
So this is the position of Rāma who is the Father. So the head of every state has to be the father of his subjects, that’s what He has tried to show by His life. So much so that He had to sacrifice His beloved Wife, whom He loved so much"</font><br>
