<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Marriage gives you now a lever to be dhārmik, to be moral.</b> This teaches you how to respect the chastity of others and your own chastity. ...<br>
<b>You have to bring glory to the system of marriages because it is the system established by God Almighty. Is not established by human beings, is a wrong idea. It is established by God Almighty</b> to have an auspicious occasion where such an auspicious thing is taken, [so] the sacredness of this is to be maintained and has to be done in such a way it is a very decent relationship.<br> 
All the culture, all the beauty of gracious living flows through happy married life. Not vulgar, not showing, not cheap, but a dignified, enjoyable, cheerful, welcoming, giving companionship"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">Gehe nije varanadhamalasath karabhjaam,<br> 
Vyhaari noopura mudanchitha manda haasam,<br>
Neehara bhanu dara muchalitham vareethum,<br>
Mohavahaam tribhuvanasya bhajamahe thwam.</font><br>
<font size="-1"><font color="DarkRed">In your own home, you took in your hand the wedding garland,<br>
And with slow laugh sounding, like the pretty and soft sound of anklets,<br>
You wedded the God who wore the crescent, And attracted all the three worlds and I sing your praise.</font></font><br> 
(Prayers by Sage Durvasa)

<font color="DarkRed">"Now, as you have got a bride and you [have] got a husband, I will tell you one thing that Sahaja Yoga will grow much more now, because of you being there as couples who follow Sahaja Yoga and who will have children of very great spiritual character. There are many Saints who want to be born on this Earth. All these Saints will be born to you because you are Sahaja Yogis and you are at a level of that great consciousness which we call as Ātma-sākṣhātkārī.<br>
<b>I wish you all very great love, prosperity and joy and that you all develop in Sahaja Yoga in a very great love and understanding</b>, forgetting what is ... what was your past, what was your religion, what was your caste, what was your country – everything forget.<br>
We are all really human beings and now we are realized Souls, so there is no difference like this. And all of you should prosper in such a manner that other people should see you and try to follow in. It’s a big responsibility, very big responsibility, I hope you understand and realize.<br>
Thank you.<br>
May God bless you.<br>
<b>Now, first thing you have to do is to accept the Vishwa Nirmala Dharma. 
This is the religion which is a Universal Religion, which encompasses all the religions, respects all the Great Incarnations, knows about them and all the good things that are told in all the religions it accepts</b>. It’s One Religion which is not outside.<br>
Outside religions have created problems you know, they just create differences di... and divise [divide] people, is divisiveness, divides people.<br>
But this is One Religion. But this One Religion was there amongst Sufis, amongst all the Saints. All those people who were born realized Souls, they had the same religion and that religion of humanity we follow. This religion is not outside, it is inside. It’s inside, in yourself, is awakened, and here we respect all the Great Incarnations. All the great religions we respect, not only that [but] we follow [them], but we do not believe in any differentiation or superiority.<br>
So the first you have to accept that you belong to this religion. Then there won’t be any fights about small things, like ‘I belong to this caste, this community, this religion, this country,’ nothing. You are beyond that and that’s what we have to establish if we want to have real peace and joy and blessings of the Divine.
<b>So, this is the first thing that we have to do: is to accept.</b>"</font><br>
