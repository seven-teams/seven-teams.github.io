<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we have gathered here to worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha.<br>
Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the Deity of Innocence.</b> When we are born as children, it is Śhrī Gaṇeśha who is acting and we are very innocent, and it is such a powerful thing that, with this innocence, children survive under many circumstances. And we love them, because they are innocent. We enjoy them, because they are innocent.<br>
Once we start growing, our Sahasrāra also gets closed and we develop all kinds of funny things that enters into us and doesn’t go out. It’s just there, it doesn’t go out.<br>
Innocence has a great effect on our character and on our sense of chastity. Actually, when you are innocent, you don’t know what is not chastity, what is being unchaste, what is being cunning. You are innocent and you are looked after by Śhrī Gaṇeśha Himself."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the embodiment of the existing reality of Paramachaitanya, or Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the manifestation of the invisible Paramachaitanya.<br>
And He establishes this perception on every chakra.<br>
Unless and until nirmalatā [immaculacy] exists in every chakra, only holiness shines from every chakra, rising of the Kuṇḍalinī is highly improbable.<br> 
Even if She rises, She keeps falling each time. <b>The relationship between Kuṇḍalinī and Śhrī Gaṇeśha is that of Mother and Child.</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Innocence is the sustainance [sustenance], is the basis of spirituality. If a person doesn’t have innocence, we [he] cannot rise in spirituality.<br>
That’s why the first job of Sahaja Yoga is to establish Śhrī Gaṇeśha within you, to awaken Him. As soon as the Kuṇḍalinī awakens, you must know that Śhrī Gaṇeśha comes into being. Without His awakening within you, Kuṇḍalinī cannot be raised. But it could be temporary, or it could be a permanent thing.<br>
It could be very temporary with people who are not yet adjusted to the new method or to the Ways of God’s Love. Those who have not understood, or those who have not gone through those traditions, is rather difficult for them to establish Śhrī Gaṇeśha within them."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Today you have come here to worship me as Śhrī Gaṇeśha. We have been singing the praise of Śhrī Gaṇeśha before every Pūjā. And we have such tremendous respect for Śhrī Gaṇeśh, because we have found out that unless and until Śhrī Gaṇeśha, who is the symbol of our innocence, is not awakened within us, we cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. And even to stay there and to enjoy the blessings of Śhrī Gaṇeśha, we have to have our innocence fully blossoming. So we praise Him and He is very easily praised. And whatever we might have done wrong before coming to Sahaja Yoga, He completely forgives because He is the eternal child."</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkGreen">"So in Sahaja Yoga everything takes place in a sahaj way when you completely accept Śhrī Gaṇeśha and accept that this Śhakti should come to us.<br>
As such Śhrī Gaṇeśha’s place is there on every chakra.<br>
That’s why I always tell you that on every chakra, a Vice Chancellor is seated.<br>
Chancellor Sir is seated and till the time He certifies, Kuṇḍalinī will not rise. And He works on every chakra."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>The greatest quality of Śhrī Gaṇeśha is joy.</b> It gives you joy, as small children, they may not speak even, but they give us so much joy. Joy-giving quality comes from Śhrī Gaṇeśha. Even after coming to Sahaja Yoga I’ve seen people are not full of joy. Are very serious, they don’t know how to laugh, how to enjoy anything. That’s the sign that they are still lacking in innocence. So it’s important to understand that, if you are Sahaja Yogis, you should be joyous and give joy to others, just like children, how sweet they are. They may be newly born, but how much joy they give you. But supposing you do not have that capacity to enjoy the innocence of children, then nobody can help you. Gaṇeśha cannot help you. Because that’s the innate quality human beings have and if you don’t have that quality, no use having any other sense. Like some people like food, they like colors, they like all other things. But if you don’t have Śhrī Gaṇeśh you cannot purely enjoy anything.<br>
So it is only [with] Śhrī Gaṇeśha’s blessings that we really enjoy everything in its full measure."</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkGreen">"In the Sahaja Yoga system, if we say that Gaṇeśha is the one who gives us, <b>He's the Adhyakṣha, means He is the, I call Him as the Chancellor of the University.</b><br> 
He is the one who goes on degree to us, 'Now, you have crossed this chakra, that chakra, that chakra.'<br> 
And He helps us to know that what state we are in.<br>  
So, the Gaṇeśha gives us say, Nirvichāra Samādhi, which we can call it as the thoughtless awareness, and Nirvikalpa Samādhi.<br>  
He gives all that and also He gives us joy."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Now there are various ways people worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha. But there’s only simple way is to remember Him and sit before His photograph and take vibrations from Him. That’s the best way you can balance yourself. There are so many worries, there are so many struggles you have, all these can be neutralized by Śhrī Gaṇeśh.<br>
He’s, though innocent, He is extremely clever. And, when He comes to your help, you are amazed how He works it out and how He removes all the hurdles and all the worries from you. So this is the most important uh Deity we have.<br>
Though it’s, it’s a very simple Deity, this Mūlādhār chakra is very, very complicated. Is one of the most complicated chakras, I think, because it has many waves, it has uh many compartments, we can say, which all the time are vibrating and oscillating. So to study down these, you should try to be absolutely dedicated to Śhrī Gaṇeśh."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>But Śhrī Gaṇeśha’s greatest contribution to Sahaja Yoga is that He makes you feel My vibrations.</b> He makes you feel the beauty of purity and simplicity. [It’s] only possible if Śhrī Gaṇeśha is awakened within you. Also, the Kuṇḍalinī won’t rise without the sanction of this Chancellor. He’s the one sitting on Mūlādhāra. But you should know He is on every chakra. Innocence cures all the maladies: physical, mental, emotional, specially the spiritual one. But Śhrī Gaṇeśha’s quality is the most important is: that He believes in emitting vibration[s], He believes in projecting His vibrations to everyone. That is the quality now I feel all of you, as Sahaja Yogis, can use.<br>
You got your Realization without any effort, I should say. It was Sahaj."</font><br>

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image492.png" /></div>

<p style=" text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Only in your Āratī, in Marathi</b>, of Śhrī Gaṇeśha, they say that, “At the time when I am getting my Realization you must save me.” That’s the only thing they ask, "At the time of my Resurrection you must save me." It does not say that, 'At the time of my Resurrection you protect me,' no! "You save me."<br>
Because He’s the one who is sitting on every chakra like a vice-chancellor of the university.<br>
Even if you have Viṣhṇu on your side, Mahādeva on your side, but if Śhrī Gaṇeśha is there sitting and He says, ‘No, not his ascent,’ it doesn’t work out, it’s very difficult."</font><br>

Let all these hypocritical things, all these conditionings and all these wrong ideas we have or all the wrong life we have had, should just disappear like thin air, and let the beautiful moonlight of your soothing qualities of innocence be manifested through us.'</i><br>
Let us manifest these qualities. This is what is to be asked."</b></font><br>
