<font color="DarkRed">"Today is a great day, of Navarātri, we are sitting on the cusp of the sixth and the seventh. <b>Sixth and the seventh is the day when Mahāsaraswatī finished Her work and the Incarnation of the Śhakti Itself started.</b> So at twelve o'clock today the Devī takes the Śhakti upon Herself.<br>
Of course, as you know, that Mahākālī and Mahāsaraswatī, both are the Powers of Śhrī Sadāśhiva. Ādi Śhakti first formed Herself into Mahākālī, which is the Power of Desire. But <b>all these powers are nothing but the Power of God's Love. So, in the series of this Great Love of God, Ādi Śhakti had to first become the Power of Desire.</b><br>
In the same way, Sahaja Yogis who are bestowed with this Power of Love have to have full desire in their heart. Desire to love. That desire is very different from the other kinds of human love we have known. In other kinds of human love, when we have relations with others, we have expectations, and that's why it is very disappointing."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>That's how the Power of Saraswatī works. People go into action for achieving the results of getting into power.<br>
But it should act to discover the Truth. Saraswatī should give you the leap to find out the Truth.</b> That, when you act in those funny places and streets, you discover, 'This is not the path, we have missed it. The path is somewhere else. We've lost it. Let us find out the real path because this doesn't give joy.'<br>
This, one can learn from others, from history, from so many other things and from your own parents, from your society and from yourself and from your children also.<br>
If you want to learn, that is the quality of Saraswatī pujārīs, that they take to gyāna, they take to reality.<br>
Vedas, in the beginning of the Vedas, it's said that: 'If by reading these four Vedas, if you do not get the Vida,' Vida is the knowledge on your nerves, means Realization, 'there is no use reading these Vedas.'<br>
<b>So the Saraswatī's first thing is that through the reading, through the process of Saraswatī's manifestation, you must reach a point to understand that this is a rat race and we have to get out of it. We have to step out.</b> When that happens, then the Mahālakṣhmī Tattwa starts working in you, that is the third tattwa, which starts working.<br>
<b>Mahālakṣhmī Tattwa then starts expressing its love in its full extent through evolutionary process in human beings.</b> He starts evolving simultaneously. He sees on both the sides what's happening, like a witness and he uses his Mahālakṣhmī Power."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>This is a worship of the Śhakti. Until now many Saints, Sages have known and revealed about this Śhakti. Whatever they could not describe in prose, they tried to convey by poetry. Whatever description was not possible to put in words -- they composed different names of the Devī and described.</b> We know all this and many people also know the meaning of this. But one thing they perhaps do not know is that every human being has all these śhaktis, powers dormant in them and they can awaken them. These dormant powers are eternal and limitless.<br>
Besides the thirty-three crores of Devas, there are many Śhaktis. But we can say that this Self-realization that we have achieved today, has been achieved through working of some Śhakti or the other. Without this you could not have achieved the Self-realization.<br>
You have received your Self-realization in Sahaj way. Now there are two meanings of Sahaj. One meaning is you have got it easily. The other meaning is, -- like any living process this has happened on its own. You have received it on your own."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today it's such a great day for Me to be with you all, again this year. It's so very joyous and full of fragrance. <b>Today we have decided to have a Pūjā of Śhakti that is the Power, that is the Devī. You know within us there are many Powers of Mahākālī, Mahāsaraswatī, Mahālakṣhmī, Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
All these Powers are there for us to ascent.</b> If these Powers are properly used and understood, then your ascent can be permanent. Once you achieve your ascent and enter into the Kingdom of God, all these Powers get enlightened.<br>
<b>And these Powers which are enlightened are absolutely filled with Love. Enlightenment, we have to understand that we get completely enlightened by Love. So after enlightenment, after Realization we use only one Power which is of Love.</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So all your powers that are there are enlightened by the All-pervading Power.</b> It transforms you and It has such a beautiful, delicate way of handling everything.<br>
The only thing that is needed is faith in this Power and to have love for others, and this enlightened love is going to give you whatever you want.<br>
And there is such a Power, All-pervading Power! There is no doubt about it! And we have to just accept it with our open heart that It fills it and makes us a great personality.<br>
So <b>there's no competition, there's no ambition, there's no jealousy, nothing of the kind.<br>
The only desire then left is that, 'I am enjoying Myself, let others also enjoy.'</b> "</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>To all devotees and followers of truth, who have assembled here for the Pūjā, I offer My protection.</b><br>
In this Kali Yug of today, when so much devotion and homage for the Mother, and so much love comes into the hearts of human beings, then we can know that Satya Yuga has begun.<br>
This is a most fortunate and divine coincidence for Me also, that on a Ṣhaṣhṭhī Day I came to Kolkata [arrival on 196-1009]. Because, in the Śhāstras it is written that the coming of the Mother is always on Ṣhaṣhṭhī Day. <b>Ṣhaṣhṭhī Day is of Śhākambharī Devī</b>, and on that day the whole nature should be green and lush."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"This work -- this Chaitanya -- that is flowing in the Universe -- is this Mahāmāyā's Śhakti -- and with this Mahāmāyā Śhakti only all the work is being done. This Śhakti -- thinks, knows, understands everything properly and organizes everything. And most important thing is that it loves you and this love is without interest (nirvāj). This love does not want anything from you, it only desires to give you, it desires your progress, it desires your well-being. But along with this, those things who want to be thorns, put obstacles in your way, put up fights or in any way trouble you, all those people should essentially be destroyed. But for this you don't put in your energy. <b>You should only invite this power, āvāhan [call] the Devī, and then you tell them to destroy these demonic people. This is a big thing and you have a relief that anyone who is trying to trouble you, abuse you, dominate you, you have a special state in you which is Nirvichār. Everything you should see in a Witness State.</b>"</font><br>
