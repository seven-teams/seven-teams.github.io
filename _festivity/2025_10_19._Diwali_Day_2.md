<font color="DarkRed">"It's a very, very great day today, I should say, where the evil has been suppressed [prolonged applause].<br>
Their evil that spreads its power all over is only because of two factors. One is that you are not knowledgeable, you are still blind, and you follow things which are not right but you think are powerful. This illusion creates not only problems, but absolute destruction.<br>
So we faced a very big challenge, no doubt, and it was [smiles] easily solve[d]. It was based on all wrong basis, just to create a problem. [The] problem was created with a purpose, and nobody could imagine that it would be solved so easily and so quickly. My desire was to get over it before Diwālī -- that has happened. [Applause.]<br>
Due to ignorance, also, people do lots of things. Anybody who follows some religion or some sort of a thing, it's only because they're not aware of the Truth, they're ignorant about achieving the Truth, and they cling on to the fact that they know everything.
With all this happening, there have been so many fractions, so many stupid people, who are getting completely ruined by ignorance.
Now we're going, coming to Sahaja Yoga: you know all the knowledge, where is s-subtle knowledge, very subtle. Is not superficial knowledge. It is very subtle.<br>
And because they don't know this subtle knowledge, they fall into the wrong path of, I should say ignorance, and then they try to oppose the people who are doing good.<br>
<b>But above all is the Power of God. All this drama is played to prove the existence of that Great Power. It has all worked out so well. And for all of you, Sahaja Yogis, it's a very great achievement that you can see the play. Many people who have achieved so-called success cannot see that point, but you can see it because you are spectators.</b> Though all the world is a part and parcel of that drama, you are outside and you can see it so clearly."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>On this day of Diwālī, I want to tell you all that the meaning of Diwālī is that the Hell is full of darkness and you all are enlightened.</b> You are expected to fight wherever there is darkness and let them know that they are wrong deeds. By doing this our country will improve and you have to do this. We have been performing Pūjās and rituals but the Śhakti [Divine Power] which is there within us, is there to oppose all that is not truthful. Many people do not know that making money is a sickness. They will go straight to Hell. I am telling you all this because no one has said it like this before. <b>On the day of Diwālī, I am telling you that we are going to light lamps and celebrate happiness in our hearts.</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Then there is, the second day is where Narakāsura [Tārakāsura] was killed. Now Narakāsura [Tārakāsura] was the one who was the devil from the Hell, let's say -- very cunning, very clever -- and he was killed by the Goddess. Actually he was killed by a, another Incarnation, Kārttikeya, but Goddess gave Him the power to kill. So when he was killed it was celebrated because the evil was killed. But we don't find that these days the evil people are getting peace awards. So what is the reason for this kind of a perverted brain? How is it they are using perversion? Just the opposite of it. What has worked out these things? So again we find the same so-called freedom to become also evil. So we have freedom to become evil. First of all we have freedom not to be benevolent, and secondly to become evil we have freedom.<br>
So the Narakāsura [Tārakāsura] within us must be killed, the one which teaches us evil, to do evil to others. If you are busy doing evil to others you can never enjoy. Because you enjoy doing evil to others. So that has to be faced within ourselves, not in other people."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So there are so many aspects for this that, after Rāma had killed Rāvaṇa, another satanic force, this Diwālī was celebrated. Also, this was celebrated much earlier, when Narakāsura [Tārakāsura] was killed. And this is how we express our joy and happiness, our gratitude to God that He has protected us always with His Power, with His Śhakti and has destroyed all the rākṣhasas and all the evil forces of this world.<br>
<b>This is the time of Thanksgiving. On this day we have to go to our elders and give thanks to them for whatever they have done for us. To all those people whom we have to give thanks, today is the day when we have to ask God to bless all these people.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Then there is Rājalakṣhmī. She is the one who gives grace to the kings. If the kings behave like servants, then they are not called as kings. They have to behave in a dignified manner. <b>The dignity, the majesty of the king comes from the Rājalakṣhmī in him. But a Sahaja Yogi need not be trained. He walks very straight in a very stately manner. In his movements he's stately, he's very majestic in handling people. He's very gracious in doing anything</b> in such a manner that people think, 'Oh, here comes a king.' "</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"But this <b>ego can be easily managed if you worship the Rājalakṣhmī</b>.<br>
She is the giver of balance. Firstly, She rides on the elephant. Is not easy for a lady to climb on an elephant, I have done it, it's not easy. Without fear. And She sits straight with a complete balanced attitude.<br>
And Her blessings are tremendous.<br>
The first blessing one gets: the imbibement of dignity. Dignity of a king, dignity of a queen. You are a queen so you can't behave like street women. With Her blessing, first of all, you get that dignity. That dignity is full of love, love for others. That personality emits nothing but love and benevolence for others, nothing else. Wherever She looks, in every glance She blesses people. She doesn't expect anything. She is a queen, what can you give to the queen? She's the highest of all in every way, what can you give it to Her?<br>
These, all these politicians and all these so-called presidents of all these countries are beggars. All the time, 'Give me this,' 'Give me this,' like greedy people going around are beggars! They are not the people who can rule. Hankering after things.<br>
So first thing is the sign, is that such a person has a personality that just blesses people, thinks of their benevolence, cares for each and every person who comes along. This is a blessing of the Goddess. <b>Then the second blessing of the Goddess is that you develop a kind of a temperament, which is very dignified, but also very humorous and understanding what other people are like.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Sahaja Yogi is a special character of a soldier who fights for the Truth.<br>
That kind of a personality, when you will have, there will be lights all over.</b><br>
In this Diwālī Day, I bless you all from My heart and I want you to respect yourself and understand what is the position of your being in this l... something ... organization we can call or a, in this Movement of Sahaja Yoga, and how are we working it out.<br> 
The attention should move from all this nonsensical, mundane things to your Self.<br>
It should be a very dynamic force that should work out. And I am sure next year it will be very different.<br>
We’ll have all the beautiful blessings of the Divine. We must do it collectively, understandingly.<br>
May God bless you!"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So what do we do to remove the darkness of the night is to put lights. In the same way people should be enlightened. There should be light in the heart of people. Once they're enlightened, this darkness from which we are suffering because of our ignorance will be finished and we'll have the Absolute Knowledge. So this is a new age that they are talking about is here right now, here, that it is going to work out in such a manner that it will be all enlightened personalities together, and they'll know what is light is, what is Real Knowledge, Gyāna.<br>
So ours is a Path of Knowledge: Knowledge that is Love, Knowledge that is Compassion. This is what we have to understand, that we have come into another area, arena, where all the skirmishes and the troubles of Kali Yuga cannot enter.<br>
......<br>
<b>With the darkness in the heart, darkness in the mind that you don't know where are you, what are you doing and what you should be doing, just like going amok you go on hitting each other. This is what is Kali Yuga, and the one who recognizes it and gets out of it is the Sahaja Yogi.</b> Otherwise you are just like other people if you are still indulging into the same periphery, in the same circles of imbalance.
......<br>
So you are all enlightened souls. For Me that's the Diwālī. If the people are enlightened that's the Diwālī: that they remove all the darkness of Kali Yuga and you all enjoy the beauty and joy of Kali Yuga. It's very, very symbolic I should say, that Diwālī has already started. We have many lights, and we have to get more lights -- not because it is short of light; why are we taking more lights, why do you want? Because all must be saved."</font><br>
