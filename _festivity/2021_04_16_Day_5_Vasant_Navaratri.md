<font color="DarkGreen">"Gaurī is the Mother of Śhrī Gaṇeśha.  And She produced Śhrī Gaṇeśha because She was having a bath, and to protect Her chastity She created Śhrī Gaṇeśh.<br>
In the same way, Kuṇḍalinī is the Gaurī and we have got Gaṇeśha sitting in the Mūlādhāra chakra. So we have Mūlādhāra as the abode of the Gaurī, of Kuṇḍalinī. And the protection of the Kuṇḍalinī is done by Śhrī Gaṇeśh.<br>
...... While <b>the Kuṇḍalinī is the Virgin, the Virgin Mother of Śhrī Gaṇeśha</b>.<br>  
...... So Kuṇḍalinī has to be supported by Śhrī Gaṇeśh. If Śhrī Gaṇeśha is weak, then Kuṇḍalinī cannot be supported. Śhrī Gaṇeśha has to support her in the awakening part first of all.<br>
The Kuṇḍalinī is the energy that you know which gives you your ascent, but it is a virgin energy. It’s a energy that is detached; it doesn’t get attached to any center, to any function, only one function it has to do, is to slowly and steadily pass through all these centers, nourish them, give them whatever they like, whatever they want, whatever they can bear, and slowly and steadily open the Sahasrāra."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"So today is a very great day, we have to thank our Mother, our Kuṇḍalinī, the Gaurī for giving us Realization and to know that we have to every time awaken Her, every time we have to expand Her, and every time to worship Her so that we always keep our Realization intact and keep our ascent intact. It is this ascent which is going to transform all the human beings. So you have to pray to Her that keep us pure, make us pure, She purifies you, Her job is to purify your chakras, so please purify us, make our hearts clean, our minds clean, everything clean and ultimately keep our connection forever and everlasting so that we feel this beautiful Power of God’s Love flowing through us."</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"If we have to ascend, if we have to go to the Kingdom of God, we have to cleanse yourselves, 
you have to become pure human beings, that we are acceptable.<br>
Now, individually, even, if you improve, if collectively if you are not improving, you are not improving at all!<br>
Because <b>it’s collectivity which is going to make you nice, that is going to mold you, that is going to make you the beautiful people of the progeny, beautiful parents, beautiful children, 
that’s My vision is.</b>"</font><br>
