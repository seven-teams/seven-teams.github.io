<font color="DarkRed">"Today is Śhrī Dattā Jayanti [birthday]. Today is a very great day. I think this day has come only because of His blessings that Sahaja Yoga has been blossomed in you people. The Guru of all the Gurus -- Ādi Guru Śhrī Dattā Mahārāja. I bow to Him, He is My Guru also. He has taught Me quite enough on Sahaja Yoga all through My many births. And because of that only I have been able to do some work in this birth also, continuing to do.<br>
<b>"Gurūr Brahmā Gurūr Viṣhṇu Gurūr devo Maheśhwara, Gurūr sākṣhāt Parabrahma tasmai Śhrī Guru dev namaḥ." The Guru is Brahmā [creator], Viṣhṇu [sustainer] and Maheśh [destroyer] and the Guru who is Himself God, I offer My obeisance to Him.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"That's My own. I have no guru, neither I ever had, <b>but I have the Guru, I call him as Dattātreya, if that is so, but that is also within Me. In My stomach is the Guru.</b> You ask this question, 'Mother, have You any Guru?' Just ask this question in your hand, and you will know it."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"All your ancient Scriptures are singing praise of the Incarnations as Gurus. Dattātreya, the three fold innocence that guides the Path of Dharma. There are Ten basic Dharmas of human beings. They must be guarded, respected and are to be identified with Tādātmya.<br>
<b>There is no compromise but human intelligence gives ideas by which human societies have gone into horrible conditions.</b> They play of mind takes us to sin and we become insensitive to sin.<br>
<b>Today I want you to resolve that you all will become absolutely dhārmik. It is hard to be a dhārmik. The society and the environment forces you to be adhārmik. You are born in innocence and later you go on compromising and accepting adhārmik patterns as normal.</b>"</font><br>

<p style=" text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkGreen">"And this G... Dattātreya is the One who is comprising all these forces: say, the existence force and the evolutionary force and the creative force, all of them, in Its innocence.<br>
I don't know if you understand it, but there is a story about Them is, that there are Three Deities, which belong to these Three Forces: the left one is Śhiva's Force, then the right one is Brahmadeva's Force, and the center one is Viṣhṇu's Force."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"All these people can feel it within themselves: is the religion in their stomachs, they can feel it. <b>They can find out where is the religion. Because, I say, there, religion in the stomach is looked after by the Deities of Primordial Master whom we call as Dattātreya, in the Sanskrit language.<br>
But does't mean Hinduism. It doesn't mean Hinduism at all. But it is called as Dattātreya in the Sanskrit language, in English is Primordial Master.</b><br>
He is the same who incarnated on this earth: as Moses, as Abraham, and, say, incarnated as Muhammad Sāhab, as Rāja Janaka, as Nāṇaka, and also as Śhirḍī Sāī Nāth. Can you believe that Muhammad Sāhab is the same as our Nāṇak?<br>
......<br>
...... the living religion is within us ...... So your religion automatically awakens and you just don't have to bother. Nobody has to tell you ......<br>
So this is a religion that is within you which is enlightened through Kuṇḍalinī and then it works out. But it is an Absolute Religion in the sense that you all feel the same thing. If you feel one finger the other is also going to feel the same thing."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"Today is the day of Guru Pūrṇimā. It is a Full Moon Day. That's why ... it is called as Pūrṇimā. The guru has to be like a Full Moon. Means completely grown, completely matured.<br>
There are sixteen kalās or the phases of the Moon, and when the complete Pūrṇimā comes in, the Full Moon Day, all the sixteen kalās are completed."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Dattātreya is the innocence of all these Three Powers.<br>
And this Guru uh was the One whose ... who then had a big tradition of Gurus.</b><br>
In the same tradition we had many Gurus in our country and specially in the area near Bombay [Mumbai], which is called as Maharashtra.<br>
They came as Nāth. <b>They were called as Nāth.</b> So the first one was Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara in Jainism], then Dattātreya, then Macchindranāth, then Gorakhnāth, like that a tradition of these Gurus came.<br>
But all their knowledge was kept as a guarded secret. It was a Gupta Vidyā, is absolutely guarded secret, a secret knowledge about Kuṇḍalinī. They never talked about it; they never told about it. Because they thought that, 'Just now let us experiment with it fully and then we will give some idea about it to people.'<br>
But as you see everywhere it happens, even it happens with us here sometimes that we get people who do not get Realization or are half-baked and they cannot rise much higher. Then they get, sort of you see, very angry or sometimes they take this half-baked knowledge and start working on it and they go absolutely wrong on this side or that side."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>Maheśha (Śhiva), Viṣhṇu and Brahmadeva form the Trinity which incarnated as one teacher God, the Primordial Master, Dattātreya.</b> He came onto this Earth to teach people the secrets of the Divine, to reveal God, and to help them cross the Ocean of Illusion themselves within their own identity. Evolution could not go further in the hands of human beings who were in the bondage of ignorance, so they were given guidance through this Incarnation of the Primordial Master (Ādi Guru) again and again in different lives. He was created as the three-headed child, Dattātreya, by Ādi Śhakti who appeared on Earth during the Tretā Yuga as Satī Anasūyā, wife of the Sage Atreya.</font><br>
