<font color="DarkRed">"...... <b>Navarātri is very good because these nine nights represent the main Nine Incarnations</b>. Where the Goddess took the form of Śhakti and killed the negative people.<br>
But those were easier days because negativity was understood by people and nobody sympathized.<br>
So this is what one has to understand that don't sympathize with negativity. You'll spoil them all. And always you'll find such sympathies bring forth your character also that you are also slightly negative.<br>
Because to fight negativity in modern times is a very difficult task. You cannot kill anyone: if you kill somebody, then may be that such a person is a brother or a sister or something of somebody. Or such a person would be himself or herself a seeker.<br>
So best thing is to separate like a contagious disease, keep that person out, no sympathies. And get the person cured and enjoy the life, otherwise that person is not going to be helped. It has become a very individual fight. And it's so troublesome and so disgusting.<br>
So to help Me out, you should not take any sides with negativity. That's how you can help Me the most. <b>This is what it is the Navarātri, the Pūjā that I give you powers to fight the negativity. That's how you cure people.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Today is the first day of Navarātri. Today your attention should be on Śhrī Gaṇeśha.</b> His devotion is infinite. He has never worshiped anybody else except Mother. Hence He is so great. All other Gods appear very strong. Everyone has some specialty. What is Mother's specialty? Her ego (aham) is nowhere felt by others. Hence Śhrī Gaṇeśha who has surrendered to such Mother, is so wise and venerable, Mother has nothing with Her. Her very name begins with Ni, e.g., Niṣhakāñchan[ā] having no wealth, Nirlepā unaffected; Nirvichārā thoughtless; Niṣhprayojanā having no motives, Nigarvitā egoless, Niricchā desireless, etc. Therefore, surrendering to such Mother, who has nothing with Her, needs some kind of subtle thought, in that, Mother has nothing with Her and therefore, nothing can be asked from Her. It shows how Śhrī Gaṇeśha by himself, is fully satisfied. Where does this contentment of Śhrī Gaṇeśha come from? It is own power."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">In the first and the second phase of evolution matter was created. At this point, Śhrī Ādi Śhakti separated from Śhrī Sadāśhiva and She created Lord Gaṇeśha to bless Her creation with innocence and auspiciousness. Hence, <b>the first prayer to the Goddess is addressed to Lord Gaṇeśha in the first night of the nine phases of the moon in the period of worship called Navarātri or nine nights of worship. Lord Gaṇeśha's Power removes all obstacles and also purifies us for undertaking the prayers to the Goddess</b>. The Blessings of the moon which is also on the left side, also arise from the same source. This is the stage of Mūlādhāra chakra in us.</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">Today we worship the Himalayas and the seven Goddesses whose blessings are here, and pray to them to bless us with Devī Śhakti. We have received the blessings of the Devī Śhakti from a Mother. That is why, in the form of Mother, let us come to the feet (śharaṇāgat) of the Himalayas.<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>On this day Devī is worshiped as Śhailaputrī, means the daughter of Himalaya.</b> Devī has many other names also but first of all She incarnated as Śhailaputrī in the cold of Himalayas. She incarnated and whatever She was to do, She started there.<br>
Further story is known to you. [King] Dakṣha did not invite Lord Śhiva in the Havana that he performed and Śhailaputrī was the consort of Lord Śhiva. She is called Satī because She entered the Holy fire of Havana and ablated Herself. But by then Lord Śhiva reached there. He lifted Her burnt up body from the fire. Burnt pieces of the body of Śhailaputrī fell at many places. All these places are considered to be Śhakti Pīṭhas, the places of worship, as there is in Vindhyāchala and many other places. Her power moves there and it is said that it Sanctifies everything.<br>
Her seventh power is considered to be the Power of Destruction. Śhakti manifested Itself on the right side as Sāvitrī and Gāyatrī but the destroying force was manifested in the center.<br>
In the form of Durgā and Her other forms manifested in Heart chakra. She is present there.<br>
If some one hurts you, confuses or disturbs you then this power will protect you and destroy your enemy."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"When He desired to create this nature, He collected a desire, we may say a wave or vibration, and filled within a container or Ghaṭ. It is that Ghaṭ. And this Ghaṭ means the God Almighty.<br>
If we can separate God Almighty and His power of desire for our understanding, then it will be easy to understand.<br>
You, people, are similar but with a slight difference. You and your desire powers are different. First, the power of your desire is born. Until you have a desire for anything, nothing is executed.<br>
This means [that] this beautiful universe is created because of someone's desire. Everything is executed after a desire. To execute the desire of God Almighty it has to be separated from Him. We will call it Ādi Śhakti.<br>
When this first stage arrived this Ghaṭasthāpanā happened. This happened so many times in ancient times and even today when we have Ghaṭasthāpanā we memorize that aboriginal happening. So on the first day of Navarātri, we do Ghaṭasthāpanā, means, remember, what an important thing it is.</b><br>
Whatever God Almighty desired at that time collected and filled in a Ghaṭ before its execution. Today we are worshiping that desire, we worshiped it today. God Almighty had that desire and brought us up to human being-ness, up to this height stage he brought us, now it is your duty to bow in front of His desire."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>But Pūjā is also an external offering. Even your heart has said so. But you should understand how you get the reward or blessings of the Pūjā and its prasād.</b><br>
A Pūjā or a prayer grows from your heart. Mantras are the words of your Kuṇḍalinī. But if Pūjā is not performed from heart or if Kuṇḍalinī is not associated with recitation of Mantras then that Pūjā becomes a ritual.<br>
If you become thoughtless in Pūjā, know that your heart is also involved in it. <b>Collect the Pūjā material and offer it sincerely. There should be no formality or bindings in the offerings.</b> It is correct to wash hands, but is your heart washed? When attention is on heart it does not go to others. Although you remain quiet from outside, you are speaking from within. Hence you should not, be silent for long time. If man's heart is not clean, then the silence becomes very harmful. At the same time loose talks can bring catastrophes.<br>
You should say the Mantras in Pūjā but with great faith (śhraddhā). There is no alternative to śhraddhā. You should perform the Pūjā when śhraddhā grows deep, so that heart itself gets all Pūjā performed."</font><br>
