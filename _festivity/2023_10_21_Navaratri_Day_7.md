<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is the Seventh Day of the Goddess when She incarnated on this Earth in Her Seventh Incarnation.</b> On this day She incarnated again and again on this land, around this area, seven times. And She is being expressed through the exuberance of the Mother Land. That She has created all the temples which have come out of the Mother Earth spontaneously.<br>
The seven of these represent the seven chakras of the Sahasrāra, the Śhaktis of the chakra ... of Sahasrāra.<br>
<b>So we are so fortunate today to be here on the seventh day to celebrate the Incarnations of these Seven Powers: of these Seven Powers which came on this Earth to give protection to the whole world, to look after the Saints, and to give them the vision of God.</b><br>
They have killed so many devils and rākṣhasas, and established the blissful, innocent life here.<br>
God looks after the innocent. He loves only the innocent and not the ones who are cunning, who are troublesome. He goes a little way towards people who are not so good as these are, tries to save them, to help them, but up to a point. Then it gives up.<br>
This is what has happened in this area before also. They were many kings who ruled these areas where they were people who worshipped the Goddess and lived a righteous, innocent life. And those who tried to insult the Mother perished forever and ever."</font><br>

<b>Te devā abruvana - Namo Devyai Mahādevya shivãi satatam namah.<br>
Namah prakrutyai Bhadrāyai niyatãh prantãh sm-tāam.</b><br>
The Gods spoke thus, Salutations to the Great Goddess, the bestower of auspiciousness.<br>
We all humbly surrender and obeise to the Prakruti (mother of the entire creation).<br>
One who bestows benedictions and rules over the entire world.<br>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Today, we have gathered here to do the Devī Pūjā.<br>
This Pūjā was performed many a times and the Devī was requested by the Devas to save them from the tyranny of devilish people. <b>Today I feel the same way, that we are now in the grip of a funny situation; that there are people who are themselves devils, I think, -- and also [who are] mesmerized by them -- who are trying to do something which they should never have done. But they don't know that there is a climax of everything. And that point has arrived where all the good people, especially the Sahaja Yogis should put all their mind to the destruction of these horrible personalities like Mahiṣhāsura.</b><br>
In those days, it was very simple because devils came as devils and you could see them, that they are devils, and all their behavior proved that they were devils. Why they did it? Why were they cruel? Because so-called `human beings' as they are -- they are not -- they are by nature devilish and they want to do something by which they can destroy human beings, and good human beings. It is evident that the time has come for them to be destroyed."</font><br>
