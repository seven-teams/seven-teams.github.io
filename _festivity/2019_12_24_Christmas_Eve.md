<font color="DarkRed">"I should say tonight is the Christmas eve and we are all here. We have to understand that now we have really entered into the area of Jerusalem and where you are built in such a way that we can understand the Great Incarnation of Christ. So far He was never understood because It was a very subtle Incarnation and that has made people go much away from Him, from the Principle of which He was made, the Innocence.<br>
So today we have to remember how He incarnated on this Earth, the innocence, the auspiciousness which was filled by Ādi Śhakti to begin with when She started to create this universe, that He was the Embodiment of all that which was so necessary before the creation started."</font><br>

<font size="-1"><font color="Blue"><b>Let our ears hear that which is true; let our eyes see that which is pure;<br>
 let our beings praise that which is divine, and let those who listen hear not my voice but the wisdom of God.<br>
Let us worship with the auspicious song, the appropriate strength, and the propitious knowledge; and let our meditation enlighten and enrich.<br> 
Let there be amongst us compassion and peace.</b></font></font>

<font color="DarkRed">"I had a special purpose in coming to Gaṇapatīpuḷe, apart from that, it was a very beautiful place and very relaxing for all of you. Uh, the reason is: I found this place had vibrations which will clear you out very easily, first of all. But you have to desire it, really, ardently. We should have that desire, otherwise the Kuṇḍalinī may not rise. That is very important point: that you have to desire your ascent, nothing else.<br>
Is not a place you have come for holiday or just for some sort of a relaxation or for some enjoyment or sleeping or anything. But you have come here for a penance, for a tapasyā, to clear out yourself completely.<br>
This is a place of Śhrī Gaṇeśha’s temple which is not very much frequented by people and is still very-very pure. And I thought that Gaṇeśh Principle will be awakened in you which is the Source of everything."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Gaṇapatīpuḷe has a special significance -- because He is Mahāgaṇeśha. The Gaṇeśha at Mūlādhāra becomes Mahāgaṇeśha in the Virāṭa, that is the brain. That means it is the seat of Śhrī Gaṇeśha. That means Śhrī Gaṇeśha governs from that seat the Principle of Innocence. As you know very well it is placed at the back in the region of optic thalamus, optic lobe as they call it; and it is the giver of innocence to the eyes.<br>

Dear all,<br>
Today is a very auspicious day as on Tuesday we are celebrating Christmas Eve and remembering the Gaṇapatīpuḷe Seminars which have been of uttermost importance for the growth and the spiritual ascent of us, the Sahaja Yogis. Let's celebrate with joy and eternal gratitude.
