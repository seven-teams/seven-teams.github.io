<font color="DarkRed">"I am with you at every step, at every place. Everywhere. You may go anywhere.<br>
At every place I am with you, completely, in person, by mind and in every respect.<br>
Whenever you will remember me I will be by your side with all my powers. It is my promise.<br>
But you have to be mine. This is necessary.<br>
If you are mine then it'll not take for me even a single second to come to you.<br>
May God bless you all and give you wisdom.<br>
Lead a life of wisdom."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"I am telling something new for them. If you are Sahaja Yogis then it should be expressed in your behavior. Every one should know that you are Sahaj Yogis. We should know that a person is either a Sahaj Yogi or a non Sahaj Yogi. We should know the art of integrating all. With this Sahaj nature you should conquer the whole world. Register in your heart what I have said.<br>
<b>This is My vision. You people could fulfill and relieve Me of My heartache.</b>"</font><br>
<b>2000-0407 Śhrī Bhūmī Devī Pūjā (Hindi), Nirmal Dham, New Delhi, India</b>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"The first thing in today's modern Sahaja Yoga, you have to know that you have to recognize Me. That is very important. Very humbly, I have to tell you - <b>you have to recognize Me and you have to respect Me and love Me</b>. If in these words, if I can explain to you, that you cannot have a double life. You cannot show love and another side you try to trouble Me. First thing is that so far there has been no en-masse realization, no en-masse realization and when there is no en-masse realization, we cannot blame the people if they did not recognize these incarnations, because without realization, how can they recognize?"</font><br>
