<font color="DarkRed">"Don't worry about anything, just know that I am the Ādi Śhakti. That all the Powers of God and Goddesses and all that are within Me and they are within Me and they are all looking after you. But if that recognition is not there, they are not going to recognize you either.<br>
So for today's Navarātri, I have to tell you that -- just try to keep in mind that today you are worshiping the Ādi Śhakti and not only Durgā. And you are worshiping Durgā and all these Goddesses to thank them because, if they had not saved you that time, you had been so frightened, you would have become bad people and would not have been here. That is why we are thankful to them for saving us and giving us this protection at that time when we were very helpless.<br>
May God bless you!"</font><br>

<font color="Navy"><b>We should devote ourselves to that Devī<br>
Who resides at the center of our lotus hearts,<br>
Whose glory is like that of the rising sun,<br>
Whose face is pleasing,<br>
Who grants all boons and protection,<br>
Who is three-eyed, Who wears red clothes, and<br>
Who fulfills the desires of Her devotees.</b></font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now the tenth Navarātri today is to celebrate actually the Ādi Śhakti.</b> So today we are really going to worship the Ādi Śhakti. On one side the Ādi Śhakti is Mahākālī, on the other side She is Mahāsaraswatī, in the center She is Mahālakṣhmī, and also She is the Ambā, the one who is the Kuṇḍalinī. But She's also beyond that. She's Parāśhakti, She's beyond all the powers because She is the Generator of Power, so She has to be beyond all that. "</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now you enter into the Kingdom of God. Then the Śhakti makes you sit on different beautiful positions, and some are sitting in the Heart of God, some are sitting in the Sahasrāra of God, in the Kingdom of God.</b><br>
Now you should assume your power. On Navarātri now, you should understand that it has now crossed the limit and now we are on the tenth position, where you must assume. I have told you many a times, now believe that you are Sahaja Yogis. Believe that you are, you have entered into the Kingdom of God. You cannot judge God, you cannot say why She does that, why She does that, why He does that. You cannot say that -- that's different. But when you sit there, then it is not an assembly, it is not like a politician fighting, no; it is that you have entered into the Kingdom of God, blessed by God, looked after, protected, nourished, and made knowledgeable.<br>
......<br>
So Navarātri's -- <b>now, the tenth day of Navarātri, which is the most important for all of you, is where this Paramachaitanya has become active. And by its activity you should know it is become very powerful, and that now anybody who tries to be nasty with you, tries to trouble you -- "I don't have to worry at all." It will take care of it.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"...... on this day of this Pūjā, <b>it's such a combination that it's the Dussehra, I am here and also you can call it the last day of the Devī Pūjā</b>. We have to see within ourselves, introspect, 'What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?"</font><br>

Victory to the all-powerful Śhrī Rāma!<br>
<b>Auṃ Twameva sākṣhāt Śhrī Rāma sākṣhāt Śhrī Ādi Śhakti Mātājī Śhrī Nirmalā Devī namo namaḥ!</b><br>
O Divine Mother, You are verily Śhrī Rāma. Salutations to You! 
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> So today is Dussehra, is a very big day in India. They say on this day Rāvaṇa was killed. He was the worst enemy of human beings, and he was killed. But whatever it is then, as a memory of that great man, Śhrī Rām, they celebrate today Dussehra. And on this day, they say, those who are duṣhṭas, means bad people or we can say negative, they are killed. Can you imagine? [Chuckles.]<br>
So this day is regarded as a very important day in India, and they make a big statue of Rāvaṇa. You all know who was Rāvaṇa, ...<br>
<b>Sahaja Yogis:</b> Yes, Śhrī Mātājī.<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b></font> ... whom Śhrī Rāma killed. He was a horrible fellow and he took away the wife of Śhrī Rām, Sītā, by force. But she was such a chaste woman that he couldn't touch Her. He tried, he couldn't touch Her. He couldn't achieve any power over Her. On the contrary, She was very powerful. </font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>When you offer Me flowers or anything else like water then the elements are happy, and the Deities are happy within their chakras so that they emit vibrations of their qualities and their blessings upon you.</b> They will give you their qualities and their blessings because this is how the Divine acts, and gradually after a Pūjā you will feel the whole thing is working out."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>I've told you before also but again today I want to tell you the significance of Pūjā. The significance is this: that when you do the Pūjā you recognize Me. By your recognition, and your surrendering, the Deities get happy.</b> They're overjoyed that you have recognized it, you are fully identified yourself, that you are understanding Me in My full form, that you are coming closer to Them. Like elder brothers feel happy when the younger ones are coming to meet them. So, They start releasing My vibrations with a greater force, much greater force.<br>
You have seen that after Pūjā, sometimes when you do not absorb the vibrations, I get little tired because the vibrations start coming out of all the chakras and you do not absorb, so the give-and-take process is not balanced.<br>
The identification in the West is very slow because of mental activity. Your attachment to your mental activity and to your rationality is very great. With Pūjā, the vibrations try to detach you from your mental activity, from your rationality. And then you ... you are station into the Realm of Divine Existence."</font><br>
