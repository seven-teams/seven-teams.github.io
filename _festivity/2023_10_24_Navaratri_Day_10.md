<font color="DarkRed">"Don't worry about anything, just know that I am the Ādi Śhakti. That all the Powers of God and Goddesses and all that are within Me and they are within Me and they are all looking after you. But if that recognition is not there, they are not going to recognize you either.<br>
So for today's Navarātri, I have to tell you that -- just try to keep in mind that today you are worshiping the Ādi Śhakti and not only Durgā. And you are worshiping Durgā and all these Goddesses to thank them because, if they had not saved you that time, you had been so frightened, you would have become bad people and would not have been here. That is why we are thankful to them for saving us and giving us this protection at that time when we were very helpless.<br>
May God bless you!"</font><br>

<font color="Navy"><b>We should devote ourselves to that Devī<br>
Who resides at the center of our lotus hearts,<br>
Whose glory is like that of the rising sun,<br>
Whose face is pleasing,<br>
Who grants all boons and protection,<br>
Who is three-eyed, Who wears red clothes, and<br>
Who fulfills the desires of Her devotees.</b></font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now the tenth Navarātri today is to celebrate actually the Ādi Śhakti.</b> So today we are really going to worship the Ādi Śhakti. On one side the Ādi Śhakti is Mahākālī, on the other side She is Mahāsaraswatī, in the center She is Mahālakṣhmī, and also She is the Ambā, the one who is the Kuṇḍalinī. But She's also beyond that. She's Parāśhakti, She's beyond all the powers because She is the Generator of Power, so She has to be beyond all that. "</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now you enter into the Kingdom of God. Then the Śhakti makes you sit on different beautiful positions, and some are sitting in the Heart of God, some are sitting in the Sahasrāra of God, in the Kingdom of God.</b><br>
Now you should assume your power. On Navarātri now, you should understand that it has now crossed the limit and now we are on the tenth position, where you must assume. I have told you many a times, now believe that you are Sahaja Yogis. Believe that you are, you have entered into the Kingdom of God. You cannot judge God, you cannot say why She does that, why She does that, why He does that. You cannot say that -- that's different. But when you sit there, then it is not an assembly, it is not like a politician fighting, no; it is that you have entered into the Kingdom of God, blessed by God, looked after, protected, nourished, and made knowledgeable.<br>
......<br>
So Navarātri's -- <b>now, the tenth day of Navarātri, which is the most important for all of you, is where this Paramachaitanya has become active. And by its activity you should know it is become very powerful, and that now anybody who tries to be nasty with you, tries to trouble you -- ``I don't have to worry at all." It will take care of it.</b>"</font><br>
