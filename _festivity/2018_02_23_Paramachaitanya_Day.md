Hallowed be Thy name.<br>
Thy kingdom come,<br>
Thy will be done<br>
On Earth as it is in Heaven.<br>
Give us this day<br>
Thy Divine vibrations;<br>
And forgive us our trespasses,<br>
As we forgive those who trespass against us;<br>
And lead us not into māyā,<br>
But deliver us from evil;<br>
For thine is the Father,<br>
The children and the glory,<br>
Forever and ever, Amen.</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b> This is the one, started already! <b>My vision for Sahaja Yoga</b> is that, that all the good people, righteous people, God-loving people will rise above all that is useless, worldly, and reside in the Heavens with all the blessings of God, for ever and ever.</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"I hope you’ll understand My vision and you’ll stand by Me, and you’ll come up to that. <b>I depend on you entirely for My vision.</b> We have to change this whole world into a beautiful place, and for that not much sacrifice is needed. You’re already blessed, you don’t have to do much; only thing is keep your attention on the Source of power.<br>
May God bless you.<br>
Thank you."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"Because in My vision, we have to change the whole world.</b><br>
I don’t know in My lifetime if I can achieve it or not.<br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"It is very important – because you know My vision is too big and you have to really work hard to fulfill My vision. And to give Realization to people as many as possible. You have to think what is your mind doing. There are many people who are waiting to come in Sahaja Yoga. You should have the light of spirituality; you have to feel that you are spiritual, you have to grow it, and also make others grow.<br>
Sahaja Yoga is not limited with you. It’s not meant for one individual, not at all for one person but for the whole world. We have Sahaja Yogis all over the world, but they don’t spread Sahaja Yoga. They are satisfied with their own motives. This is not Sahaja Yoga. You must openly talk about and say about it. But Sahaja Yogis are very shy, they don’t talk about Sahaja Yoga. They can do it, no doubt."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"I am telling something new for them. If you are Sahaja Yogis than it should be expressed in your behavior. Every one should know that you are Sahaj Yogis. We should know that a person is either a Sahaj Yogi or a Non Sahaj Yogi. We should know the art of integrating all. With this Sahaj Nature you should conquer the whole world. Register in your heart what I have said."</font><br>

and thank Me seven times.<br>
‘Mother thank You very much for the Realization.<br>
And Mother, thank You very much for making us<br>
understand how great we are.<br>
And thank You very much for bringing all the blessings of the Divine.<br>
And thank You very much for raising us higher, much higher, than from where we were.<br>
And also thank You very much for sustaining us and for helping us to improve ourselves and correct ourselves.<br> 
And thank You very much ultimately that Mother, You have come on this Earth, taken Your birth, and working so hard for us, for all of us.’ "</font><br>

<p>
Dear All,<br>
Today, on the Mahasamadhi Day of the complete Incarnation of Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmal Devi, with folded hands and bended knees and in complete love and awe and gratitude, we remember the Earthly life of our Divine Mother and all She has done for the evolution, redemption, and spiritual uplifting of mankind.
It is a time to re-commit and re-dedicate ourselves to Her Visions expressed in Her teachings, to the work of Sahaja Yoga, and to the advancement of Vishwa Nirmala Dharma and of Sahaja Culture.  We  pray to Shri Mataji to help us to accomplish all Her Divine Visions.<br>
