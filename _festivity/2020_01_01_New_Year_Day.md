<font color="DarkRed">"So today is a day of a new year and we should think why do we have new years – what is the need to have a new year? We want something new that you start something afresh to ourselves, to others, to your Mother, to your Guru. That you have to get out of the clutches of ignorance and darkness. That you have to get out of the bondage's of ego. That you have to become absolutely a free glorious personality.<br>
And that you have to fight the superego influences and all the bad conditionings should be thrown as torn clothes and should wear new beautiful clothes of Sahaja Yogis.<br>
Let all the people, let all the Sahaja Yogis raise their voices from the top of their houses and top of their mountains, the top of their higher positions. Broadcast to the whole world, inform the whole people that you have found the Truth and everybody has to find the Truth, otherwise there is no escape. That you have found the joy and that everyone has to find it and everybody must work to get to it."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Whenever a new year starts, then a new thing, a new concept, a new understanding awakens inside a human being. It automatically happens. Whosoever started the concept of new year must have been a great visionary so that on this occasion symbolically, inside human beings a new ambition, a new thought, a new revolution should awaken. Like today many new years have come and gone, new ambitions came, new concepts came and finished."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Every moment is a New Year for a Sahaja Yogi because he lives in the present and neither in future nor in the past gone by. For him, every moment is a New Year, a new surge of joy (umang), a new wave. Just as one, while already swimming in the Ocean of Love is lovingly tossed every moment by the love all around, so also every Sahaja Yogi is to live in complete joy (ānand), love (prem), peace (śhānti) and blissful delight (āhlād). The question is whether we have learnt to swim thus?<br>
Only he should be called a Sahaja Yogi who has achieved complete satisfaction and tranquility [samādhān] and his pure desire has been fulfilled. He should now enjoy the supreme and unique bliss of his immense capacity to give this to others."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Every year a new year comes and keeps coming. But people do not understand the feeling of creating a new year. They only understand that on the New year day they will wear new clothes and celebrate. They never think that a new year is coming and what new thing we must think of. Whatever has been going on, it goes on day after day.<br>
In Sahaja Yoga when we are so collective, then we must think what new thing we must have in Sahaja Yoga. You have gone quite deep in meditation. You understand meditation and you have also established a certain state. But in a new year what new aspect you should take, we must put out attention towards this. We must think what are the problems of our country and also the problems of the world, and how can we solve them. For this, I think wherever a Sahaja Yogi has interest he should put attention on that."</font><br>
