<font color="DarkRed">"Had a very nice Pūjā in Pune which I had to perform on the thirteenth because it is the date called <b>Akṣhaya Tṛitīya, means un-destructible [indestructible] third day of the Moon. That's actually nobody knew, but it is the Pūjā of the Kuṇḍalinī.</b> That day everybody felt very, very clear. Very clear. Pūjā was hardly for about half an hour, the real Pūjā of the Kuṇḍalinī. But everybody felt extremely clear and beautiful.<br>
So, that sort of Pūjā we should do tomorrow also, if possible, so that we'll have the feelings of Sahasrāra completely opened out because even if Sahasrāra is opened, the rest of the chakras, if they are caught up then you have problems. It's better to clear out all the chakras and then the Sahasrāra. So, tomorrow we'll do the Pūjā in that fashion and I hope it will work out very well for all of you."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen"><b>:So when you worship the Ādi Kuṇḍalinī, what you are trying to do is to cleanse your Kuṇḍalinī as well as please the Deities. Because this is an object, it is object, it is not to be changed -- but the reflection can change."</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So first, your vibrations must improve, to receive. If the reception is not good what’s the use of any Pūjā or projection? So first of all we, sort of, prepare our instrument or prepare our projecting instrument.<br>
<b>That preparation is done by praying to different Deities, as we call that: a Kuṇḍalinī Pūjā. By praying to My Kuṇḍalinī you improve your reflection. Because then the vibrations from Me start flowing into yours and they awaken it. This is the projection as far as you are concerned.</b><br>
Once the instrument is all right, then you project outside. And now how do you project? By worshiping the Goddess as the Protector of the whole Universe, praising Her different attributes, even Her Face, Her Hands, everything has a meaning. Praising Her Powers."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Today we have gathered here to do the Pūjā of Ādi Kuṇḍalinī as well as your own Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
First of all, I think this is the most important thing to understand about your own Kuṇḍalinī, as Self-realization is Self-knowledge. And the one who gives you Self-knowledge is this, your own Kuṇḍalinī, because when She rises She points it out what are the problems on your chakras.<br>
Now, we say that it is pure desire, but we do not know what purity means. It means your chaste desire. It means it has no lust, greed, anything in it. That power is your own mother and is settled in your triangular bone. She’s your own mother. She knows everything about you, it’s like a tape recorder. She knows everything about you and She is absolutely the knowledge – because She’s so pure."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"I just explained to you, today is a day where, whatever you want to know of eternal nature, you can ask Me. And we'll ask for eternity.<br>
But many people think that today is a day when, whatever you ask, God has to give you. Is true. Whatever you ask, you'll get it. But [is] just a temptation.<br>
Beyond that, is eternity. So whatever you have to ask, you should ask for something that is eternal, is indust ... indestructible. That higher state, we should call the Permanent State of Joy and Bliss, is to be asked today. Because all other askings are useless. And you again go back to the position where you were."</b></font><br>

Akṣhay means the thing that cannot be destroyed, can... cannot be turnished, that cannot be challenged. And that is on third day of the Moon, is Tṛitīya."</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"This day is considered as the auspicious day. So good work it started on this day.<br>
So, today you will make up your mind to meditate every day with introspection. Must think about oneself and not about others. `How shall we spend our life with sweetness in talking while dealing with others? How shall we make someone understand our feelings sweetly?' No one must be hurt. Whatever one feels must be told, sometimes it has to be told boldly. But most of the time when you tell something, the other person must feel that this is being told out of love. This love should be expressed.<br>
I have to tell people every day. So, what should be told to each one? How do I explain this? But this Power of Love is seen all around. This love is within Me. This give and take happens with love. Sahaja Yogis must not get angry. Peaceful behavior must be seen. I have been telling how you must behave after Realization. By introspection look at yourself with love and not hatred. <b>It is My dream that with Sahaja Yoga the world must change.<br>
Eternal blessings.</b>"</font><br>
