<font color="DarkRed">"So, this is what it is. One has to know that Mahālakṣhmī Tattwa is represented here as the light. And, you see these lights when enlightened, even a small light, how it reacts and how it shows. And now, you have become the light, you see. Even this light can do it. You see, I put My hand to it and it recognizes and knows that because it is now enlightened. It is put before the Photograph, it’s enlightened. It works that way. Now, what about you? <b>You are the light now; you are the Diwālī of God.</b><br>
<b>Diwālī means the rows of lights. So, you are going to make this beautiful mansion of God full of Diwālī light. You have entered into the Kingdom of God and you have to enlighten it. So you are the decoration of God on one side, you are the glory of God</b> and also, on the other side you are the guide, guidelines – you are like the torches, ......"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So tomorrow is the New Year Day. Now, why is it necessary to have a New Year Day in our life? While last year those who got Realization were very lucky people, but plodding through the path of Self-realization one loses all the enthusiasm and idealism that one has when you get Realization.<br>
You think of doing so many things about it. When you get Realization you are so much engrossed into it, you enjoy it so much that you think that, ‘Now! The time has come for me to do this and that and that, and I’m going to contact these people and I’m going to give this to news to this one, and I’m going to do this work and show to Mother that what She has given me, I have made it many folds.’ Because it was a new experience, great experience, the only experience that you have been waiting for. And that you also decide that, ‘I am going to now become the torchbearer of this great light that has come into me, and I am going to form one of the lights of this Dīpawali.’ Dīpawali, dīp means these lights, āwali means the row of lights. ‘So I am going to be one of them. And we are going to enlighten the path of the people who want to have Self-realization.’ All these great ideas come to us when we touch our depths. And we feel responsible for all the rest of the humanity."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So, the New [Year] Day comes to remind you: ‘Doesn’t matter, whatever has happened has happened, is finished. Today a new day has come to you again for you to promise again. Again start your journey, know the sun has come.</b> And now be refreshed, the newness bring[s] the freshness of life.’ And then you again start, greater enthusiasm on the New [Year] Day, with new ideas, with new promises, with new vows, and with greater understanding about Sahaj Yog.<br>
Those who have got now Realization, they have to know actually what happens as you mature. You start changing your attitude.<br>
...... So this attitude when develops in you, you should know that you are mature. This attitude is the only test to see that it is mature[d]. No questions, no problems, only thought that really covers the entire space before us is how to bring others to this great heavenly atmosphere of Divine Love."</font><br>

<font color="MidnightBlue"><b>"...... this new awakening within you that you have to achieve God now, is the power of Mahālakṣhmī.<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we are going to worship the Mahālakṣhmī</b> which I think is very much worshiped in this country where they worship Her as Maria and also there’s a swayambhu of Maria, ......<br>
<b>This is the principle by which you have risen to this state. The central path of your ascent is created by Mahālakṣhmī Power for the Kuṇḍalinī to rise.</b><br>
...... Coming to the point of Mahālakṣhmī, we have to understand what does it do, what its help is that this Mahālakṣhmī channel or the Mahālakṣhmī’s Powers have created within us a proper balance, a proper route for Kuṇḍalinī to rise.<br>
Left and right has been balanced and She is the one who creates and makes a wider Path for Kuṇḍalinī to rise. This is the Path of Compassion and Love.<br>
Through that compassion and love She creates this Path because She knows that if the Path is not wide enough the Kuṇḍalinī cannot rise. Ultimately, one reaches a state where you start seeking and when you start seeking, your Mahālakṣhmī Principle has been awakened. That is awakened and sometimes it is very strong. Then you start seeking in a mad way. I am sorry to say that many are already lost in seeking, but there are so many who have now come to the right path and to the right ascent."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"But in Sahaja Yoga, we believe that the Lakṣhmī must become Mahālakṣhmī. Man has to become greater man: mahā mānav. What does that mean? That she has to become the Mahālakṣhmī. <b>Mahālakṣhmī is a Deity which makes you absolutely satisfied with whatever you have. Complete satisfaction.</b>"</font><br>
