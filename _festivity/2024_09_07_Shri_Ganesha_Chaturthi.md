<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we have gathered here to worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha.</b><br>
<b>Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the Deity of Innocence.</b><br>
When we are born as children, it is Śhrī Gaṇeśha who is acting and we are very innocent, and it is such a powerful thing that, with this innocence, children survive under many circumstances. And we love them, because they are innocent. We enjoy them, because they are innocent.<br>
Once we start growing, our Sahasrāra also gets closed and we develop all kinds of funny things that enters into us and doesn't go out. It's just there, it doesn't go out.<br>
Innocence has a great effect on our character and on our sense of chastity. Actually, when you are innocent, you don't know what is not chastity, what is being unchaste, what is being cunning. You are innocent and you are looked after by Śhrī Gaṇeśha Himself."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So the priorities have to change if Śhrī Gaṇeśha is to be worshiped. What are we worshiping today is the innocence within us. We are worshiping that is auspicious, which is innocent. Innocence, which is deep down within us -- that's our character, that's our nature, that's what we are born with -- is the basic of this whole Creation, is the essence of this Creation."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today you have come here to worship Me as Śhrī Gaṇeśha.<br>
We have been singing the praise of Śhrī Gaṇeśha before every Pūjā. And we have such tremendous respect for Śhrī Gaṇeśh, because we have found out that unless and <b>until Śhrī Gaṇeśha, who is the symbol of our innocence, is not awakened within us, we cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. And even to stay there and to enjoy the blessings of Śhrī Gaṇeśha, we have to have our innocence fully blossoming</b>. So we praise Him and He is very easily praised.<br>
And whatever we might have done wrong before coming to Sahaja Yoga, He completely forgives because He is the eternal child."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today, we have gathered here to worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha.<br>
<b>You all know what a powerful Deity He is. His Power comes from His innocence.</b><br>
When we see small children, we [are] automatically compelled towards them and also we want to love them, kiss them and be with us [them]. And very innocent they are, extremely innocent.<br>
And when we worship Śhrī Gaṇeśh we have to know if we have been really innocent or not."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>The greatest quality of Śhrī Gaṇeśha is joy.</b> It gives you joy, as small children, they may not speak even, but they give us so much joy. Joy-giving quality comes from Śhrī Gaṇeśha.<br>
Even after coming to Sahaja Yoga I've seen people are not full of joy. Are very serious, they don't know how to laugh, how to enjoy anything. That's the sign that they are still lacking in innocence.<br>
So it's important to understand that, if you are Sahaja Yogis, you should be joyous and give joy to others, just like children, how sweet they are. They may be newly born, but how much joy they give you.<br>
But supposing you do not have that capacity to enjoy the innocence of children, then nobody can help you. Gaṇeśha cannot help you. Because that's the innate quality human beings have and if you don't have that quality, no use having any other sense. Like some people like food, they like colors, they like all other things. But if you don't have Śhrī Gaṇeśh you cannot purely enjoy anything.<br>
So it is only [with] Śhrī Gaṇeśha's blessings that we really enjoy everything in its full measure. "</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So today's Pūjā is specially to be done with a prayer in your heart that: 'Śhrī Gaṇeśha, please be kind and merciful and forgiving that You manifest within ourselves. Let all these hypocritical things, all these conditionings and all these wrong ideas we have, or all the wrong life we have had, should just disappear like thin air, and let the beautiful moonlight of your soothing qualities of innocence be manifested through us.'<br>
Let us manifest these qualities. This is what is to be asked."</b></font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"In the Sahaja Yoga system, if we say that Gaṇeśha is the One who gives us, He's the Adhyakṣha, means He is the, I call Him as the Chancellor of the University. He is the one who goes on degree to us, 'Now, you have crossed this chakra, that chakra, that chakra.' And He helps us to know that what state we are in. So, the Gaṇeśha gives us say, Nirvichāra Samādhi, which we can call it as the thoughtless awareness, and Nirvikalpa Samādhi. He gives all that and also He gives us joy."</font><br>

Śhrī Mātājī</b>: Now, what you are doing by saying these mantras, you are awakening the innocence within you. <b>Innocence is represented by Śhrī Gaṇeśh.</b> As you know, later on He incarnated as Lord Jesus Christ, but the innocence within us must be first of all invoked, because, before creating the universe, first of all innocence was created, because innocence has the greatest protective power, the greatest destructive power and it is the most powerful. So, first we are trying to invoke the innocence.<br>
<b>Now, My Feet here represent Gaṇeśha, and they are innocent, and so, we are trying to worship those so that, within you, Gaṇeśha should be invoked. Your innocence should be enlightened, all right?</b>"</font><br>
