<font color="DarkRed">"<b>You are blessed because you did good work. You had puṇyas in last life, that’s why you are born in this great country. You are seekers of a very high quality.</b> But you have lost it completely. That rigid you have lost, get back to it. Every one of you can beat all these gurus out. Everyone of you can give thousands of people Realization. First of all you must become a dynamic, compassionate person. Then only you’ll work it out and with so many Sahaja Yogis we can blast. Discipline, discipline. That’s one of the most important. Discipline your mind, discipline yourselves because He is Yogeśhwara – the One who is the Master of Yogas. Yogeśhwara, completely disciplined. Nothing can deter Him. No temptations. Nothing."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Shrī Kṛiṣhṇa, who was the greatest expression of God the Father, incarnated to open another horizon in human understanding of the power of Divine Love to watch the play of God’s power as a witness. By His Incarnation, human imagination was to become aware of the witnessing powers of God Almighty.</b> The Great Primordial Being (Virāta) was actually expressed through Him, and His advent enabled poets and philosophers to enter the intuitive realm of metaphysical perceptions. He employed the method, as king and diplomat, of Divine Diplomacy to explain the true nature of reality to people. The beauty of Divine Diplomacy is to achieve the spiritual betterment of people; its essence is to guide ignorant and foolish people towards the path of righteousness and religion by diplomatic ways, by clever handling or by illusion. In short, such people must be brought to the shores of Divine Love ‘by hook or by crook’. Shrī Kṛiṣhṇa’s life was spent with the masses, and thus His Incarnation gave rise to a mass spiritual movement. He appeared before Arjuna as the Virāta, and for the first time human eyes got a glimpse of the Primordial Being Himself.</font><br>

<font color="blue">"Ādi Viṣhṇu’s eighth form was as Shrī Kṛiṣhṇa during the Dwapara Yuga, and again Ādi Shakti took three forms.<br> 
<b>Mahākālī lived for a very short time as Viṣhṇumāyā</b>, the infant sister of Shrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br>
She was actually born as the daughter of Yeshodā, Shrī Kṛiṣhṇa’s foster mother, and was killed by the demon Kamsa. 
She later took birth as Draupadi, wife of the Pandavas.<br> 
<b>Yeshodā was Herself an Incarnation of Mahāsaraswatī</b><br> 
<b>As Mahālakṣhmī She took two forms, Rādhā and Rukminī.</b><br> 
'Rā'' means power or energy and 'dhā'' means sustenance, so the name 'Rādhā' means the one who sustains the power.<br> 
<b>As Rukminī She became Queen to Shrī Kṛiṣhṇa, the King in Dwaraka.<b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Now when we have our Vishuddhi problems we have to know what are the deities on both the sides and what were their qualities which are lacking in us – that’s why we are suffering. Let’s see the right side Vishuddhi when we catch. <b>Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa’s essence is sweetness – madhurya, madhurya.</b> And His power was Rādhā. ‘Ra’ is energy ‘dha’, means the one who has sustained the energy. And Her power was, She was called as Āhlāda. ‘Āhlāda’ means joy giving qualities She had. So <b>Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa’s qualities were that He was Yogeśhwara, so He was the witness and sweetness.</b> Now a person who shouts and screams and talks loudly and loses his temper in a very loud voice, or who speaks very loudly all the time, they all suffer from the right Vishuddhi. So one should understand that even when you have to scold somebody, you have to just say, “What are you doing? Why are you doing like this?” Otherwise “I give you, oh do like this?” Finished! Right Vishuddhi over. It’s finished now.<br>
<b>So for the right Vishuddhi we use the mantra of Viṭṭhala and Rukminī</b>, these two persons. You see it is very significant that also, because they say that there was a pundalikaksh, one boy who was serving his parents. And his parents were sleeping, he was pressing their feet when Viṭṭhala and His power Rukminī, they appeared in the door. But he said, “Now keep quiet. My parents are sleeping so you stay there!” So he had one brick near him which he threw and asked them, “You stay on that.” So They kept quiet, They kept quiet because they are sleeping. Now this is the thing is. On the right side if you are talking loudly, if you talk too much, if you intimidate people with your talking then you catch on right Vishuddhi. So for that best is to take some rest and give some rest to your right Vishuddhi by stopping your talk. Go into mauna they say, just don’t talk. For some time if you don’t talk you will see that your Vishuddhi will be improved, your problems will be improved."</font><br>

<p style=" text-align:center;">
<font color="blue">"First and foremost thing is, that we must speak in a sweet manner.<br> 
Speak to someone in a sweet manner, not artificially, but sweetly.<br> 
<b>Speak in a manner that another person likes it: “satyam vadet, priyam vadet” [speak the truth, speak that which pleases].</b><br> 
Speak the truth. Don’t tell the lies. If you go on telling lies, after some time even if you tell the truth, it will become a lie.<br>  
But if you are telling the truth, that, even if you tell a lie, it becomes a truth."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So Kṛiṣhṇa was a incarnation of diplomacy, I must say, divine diplomacy, because He knew about the human brain, and He knew how to put it forward.</b> So He said, “All right, you do all your karmas, and put it at the Lotus Feet of the Lord,” which cannot be, it’s not possible. We may mentally think, “Oh, I’m doing all for God’s sake I’m doing this.” That’s just our imagination. But you just don’t do it, because the karma has to become akarma, means ‘non-action’ – that’s only possible when you get your Self-realization.<br>
When a self-realized Soul gives you Kuṇḍalinī, he doesn’t say – raises your Kuṇḍalinī, doesn’t say, ‘I do it.’ He says, “It’s rising, it’s going, it’s working out.” In the third person he talks, so the whole thing becomes akarma. Then He says that “Whatever are the flowers and things like that you give Me” – that’s the bhakti yoga – “I’ll take it.” But He uses only one word on which He has made everybody dance, and that word is ananya – <b>Ananya Bhakti: "When there is not the other, when you are united with Me."</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b> So this Viśhuddhi on the right-hand side is to be controlled by surrendering as it is said, actually you surrender your ego to begin with. And this ego when you surrender, it has to be done from you heart, it should not be a lip service. From your heart: “I don’t want this ego any more, I want reality.
Let the reality be seen by me, felt by me, enjoyed by me.” And once you start doing it from your heart you’ll be amazed that your voice will become sweet. Apart from that it will have the Divine Power flowing through it. That is what we say that you have now got Vāk Śhakti, means ‘the Power of Speech’.
So when you surrender ego, what do you do actually is to say that, “I’m not doing anything, it is You who do everything.” So that a little drop has now become an Ocean. And so, your sound has got the Power of the Ocean.</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Your will, will be respected throughout. Every other thing can be looked after except
for one that <b>you should be a perfect machine, a perfect channel, a perfect flute for My Lord to play that tune of love.<br>

It is for you to clear out your hollowness and to be complete within yourself and He knows his job.<br>

And the harmonious music from so many souls can fill the ears of these evil people and can penetrate into their heart and put love into them and maybe that they themselves will give up their evil ways and fall at the feet of love."</font><br>
