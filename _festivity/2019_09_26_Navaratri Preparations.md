<font color="DarkRed">"Don't worry about anything, just know that I am the Ādi Śhakti. That all the Powers of God and Goddesses and all that are within Me and they are within Me and they are all looking after you. But if that recognition is not there, they are not going to recognize you either.<br>
So for today's Navarātri, I have to tell you that -- just try to keep in mind that today you are worshiping the Ādi Śhakti and not only Durgā. And you are worshiping Durgā and all these Goddesses to thank them because, if they had not saved you that time, you had been so frightened, you would have become bad people and would not have been here. That is why we are thankful to them for saving us and giving us this protection at that time when we were very helpless.<br>
May God bless you!"</font><br>

Dear Brothers & Sisters,<br>
Jai Shri Mataji!<br>
Navaratri Celebrations provide a unique opportunity for individual and collective inner growth. Let's get together to worship Shri Mataji as the Supreme Goddess in all Her Divine Forms. All the Goddesses and all the Gods are Shri Mataji's First Children and Divine Emanations of Hers and thus we would like to please Them by making offerings and uttering prayers at the Lotus Feet of Shri Mataji so that Her different Shaktis that abide in all human beings are awakened and manifested within all of us.<br>
This year Navaratri in America starts from the 29th of September to the 7th of October which is celebrated as Vijayadashami.<br>
The 2nd and 3rd day are combined this year.<br>
We shall worship Shri Mataji in the nine forms of Shri Durga as described by Shri Brahmadeva in the Kavach of the Devi.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
<b>"</b><font color="Green"><b>Brahmadeva said</b></font>;<br>
Brahmin, there is Devi Kavach which is most secret and useful to all beings.<br>
Please listen to that, O Great Sage.<br>
The following nine names have been told by the Great Soul Brahmadeva Himself. Durga is known by these names:<br>
<font color="red">1st SHAILAPUTRI (Daughter of the King of Himalayas)<br>
2nd BRAHMACHARINI (One Who observes the state of Celibacy)<br>
3rd CHANDRAGANTA (One Who use the Moon as Her bell)<br>
4th KOOSHMANDA (Mother's lap)<br>
5th SKANDAMATA (Mother of Shri Kartikeya)<br>
6th KATYAYANI (Who incarnated to help the Devas)<br>
7th KALARATRI (Who is even the destroyer of Kali)<br>
8th MAHAGAURI (Adi Kundalini)<br>
9th SIDDHIDATRI (Giver of all Siddhis)<br>
10th Shri Adi Shakti (Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi)</font><b>"</b><br>
<b>(from the Kavach of the Devi: Navaratri Nights, Pune, October 1988)</b>
</p>	

<p style="text-align:left;">
On the 29th of September is the first day of Navaratri. The first day of Navaratri signifies God’s desire to create the universe which is called Ghata Sthapana (Laying of the Foundation) and Shri Ganesha is worshipped as the first creation. Ghata Sthapana also involves symbolically growing grains around the Kalash.
</p>	

<p style="text-align:left;">
We share the guidelines for Ghatasthapana:
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
<b>Things required for Ghatasthapana:</b><br>
*Ghata (kalash), made of earth/Copper/brass<br>
*Coconut, decorated as we decorate for Puja Kalash<br>
*A big plate filled with 1/2 soil -- plate can be made of earth/copper/brass<br>
*10 Mango or Betel (Pan) leaves<br>
*One handful Nine Grains (Nava-dhanya) or Whole Wheat Grains (soaked in normal water, night before the first day of Navaratri)<br>
* A big lamp (diya) which we can keep lit for 10 days uninterrupted in front of Mother
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
<b>On the first day of Navaratri: Ghatasthapana</b><br>
All the members of the family or collective can sit and meditate. All the things mentioned above should be kept ready in front of Shri Mataji.<br>
A small Puja can be offered at the Holy Lotus Feet of Shri Mataji.<br>
Collectively recite Mahamantras & then Shri Ganesh Mantra.<br>
Collectively recite Shri Ganesha Atharvashirsha.<br>
We can wash Her Holy Lotus Feet, decorate it with kumkum, offer fragrance, flowers, etc., while singing Devi bhajans collectively.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
<b>Perform Ghatasthapana:</b><br>
Items listed above to be used in the following sequence:<br>
Keep the big plate on the left side of Shri Mataji (our right side when we face towards Shri Mataji) on the floor. Little amount of akshada (rice mixed with turmeric) is to be put on the floor below big plate.<br>
* Fill in the big plate 1/2 full with the soil.<br>
*Decorate kalash and coconut by drawing Swastika on it.<br>
* Fill in 3/4 full vibrated water in the kalash, keep 10 leaves and the coconut on the mouth of kalash.<br>
*Keep the decorated kalash in the centre of the big plate already filled with soil.<br>
*Offer haldi & kumkum, akshada, flowers and garland to the kalash.<br>
* Spread sowing the Whole Wheat Grains/Nine Grains in the big plate around the kalash in the soil (earth element).<br>
*Spread the soil in little quantity over the wheat grains and sprinkle some water over it.<br>
Offer Prasad and perform Aarti to Shri Mataji. Then sit in meditation collectively.
