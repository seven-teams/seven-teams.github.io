<font color="DarkRed">"So the ascent starts evolving. In that, the play of the Devī is the Navarātri -- in your ascent -- from ages. <b>Navarātri that's why is the most important Pūjā. In Sahaja Yoga, Navarātri is the most important Pūjā, I would say. Though we can say in modern Sahaja Yoga Sahasrār Day is, because that's how you started getting your Realization. But if you go to the whole historical events of evolution you'll find [that] Navarātri is the one which has brought you to Sahasrāra. Without the help of the Devī at different stages of your ascent, you could not have been in a position to receive your Realization. So all the steps that you took in the past are today worshiped and are used for thanking the Devī for what She did to bring you down here. So it's like a thanksgiving. Without Her work, nothing could have happened.</b><br>
So when we read about the Devī, about Her Incarnations -- how She came on this Earth to save Her bhaktas, people who were trying to ascend, to cross this Bhavasāgara, how She worked hard, how She fought the devils, how She cough... She killed the demons, single-handed -- She took upon Herself the responsibility of making the people cross the Bhavasāgara.<br>
<b>Guru gave you the strength to have dharma but She is the One who brought you out. Even those who were dhārmik could not do it because of the demonic pressure. She's the One who fought, single-handed, with Her Powers of destruction. In Her Love for you She fought. She brought you to this level.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>The Devī incarnated on this Earth to kill the demonic personalities who try to destroy all the good qualities of women. We also have those demonic personalities within us and they are to be destroyed -- not physically, but mentally.</b><br>
How you accept them and how you deal with whatever they try is very surprising.<br>
<b>You must understand that the goodness of a person is very important. If you are trying to be nasty or dominating then you'll be definitely destroyed. That's why this Devī has come on the Earth. That is the assurance of this Devī, the Goddess.</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"But Goddess Herself has done so many things for us already, within us, though we are not aware of it. Is said that, "Yā Devī sarvabhūteśhu": "All those whom You have created," means mostly the human beings, "What do You do? As what do You exist inside the human beings?"<br>
Now, just introspect if you have these qualities within you or not, because they are given to you by the Goddess, by the Śhakti within you."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"You cannot make anyone brahmachārī or brahmachāriṇī. It is a state, avasthā, where a person has to rise, like Yogeśhwara, like Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br>
......<br>
It is a state of mind where you are not involved. It is a different thing, that you just load somebody with an idea that You should become, absolutely a brahmachārī or a brahmachāriṇī or you should lead a celibate life, forcing them.</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"And that is why, <b>today is the day when the Virgin, Gaurī, sat down to worship Śhiva</b>. She made a Śhiva Lingua and was sitting and putting Her sindūr on that: "That you look after this, which is the mark of my Union with you. I leave it to you, to look after" -- to Śhiva. "You look after me. I surrender to you." With this, that's how Gaurī your Kuṇḍalinī surrenders to the Spirit: 'Now You look after this connection. I forget everything else. I leave it into Your hands. Lift Me up. You raise Me up. I forget all that was Me before. Everything I have dropped out. No other desire. But just lift Me higher and higher. Make Me Yourself. The rest of it is not important. All other manifestations of this, desires are over. Now, I am absolutely surrendered to You, My Spirit. Lift Me higher and higher. Higher and higher, away from all the things that were not the Spirit. Make Me complete Spirit, full Spirit.' "</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now what happens actually when you project this Pūjā?</b><br>
It has been found out, and now as I am telling you, <b>that first you have to awaken within you the Deities that are still asleep, by worshiping them. But as these Deities, Primordial Deities, are with Me, you worship Me, and every Deity in Me is awakened, by which your Deities are awakened.<br>
So first, your vibrations must improve, to receive. If the reception is not good what's the use of any Pūjā or projection?</b> So first of all we, sort of, prepare our instrument, or prepare our projecting instrument. That preparation is done by praying to different Deities, as we call that: a Kuṇḍalinī Pūjā. By praying to My Kuṇḍalinī you improve your reflection. Because then the vibrations from Me start flowing into yours and they awaken it. This is the projection as far as you are concerned.<br>
Once the instrument is all right, then you project outside. <b>And now how do you project? By worshiping the Goddess as the Protector of the whole Universe, praising Her different attributes, even Her Face, Her Hands, everything has a meaning. Praising Her Powers. By saying that, by repeating that, you echo in your projection Her Powers, and then your projection becomes that powerful.</b> It's a very subtle happening that takes place, it's miraculous. <b>These things look so simple, like just like washing My Feet.</b>"</font><br>
