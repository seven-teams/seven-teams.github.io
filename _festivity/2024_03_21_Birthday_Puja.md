<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Birthday of your Mother, and all such celebrations, have a very deep significance. Because on such occasions, special vibrations flow in the atmosphere.</b> When all the celestial bodies, the Eternal Personalities, Gods and Goddesses, s-s-sing the praise, and that's how the whole atmosphere is filled with mirth and happiness.<br>
Human beings also, express their gratitude. Expression of gratitude and love is done in different, different ways in different countries, but the substance remains the same and the forms change.<br>
The substance is like the ocean which flows continuously towards the shores, and the ripples which touch the shores are again repelled back, and a nice pattern is formed. It is such a spontaneous thing, and is so beautiful, creates such a beautiful pattern in the atmosphere. All these waves when they weave together the pattern of love, they soothe human beings, they enchant human beings, and the whole thing is very blissful.<br>
On such occasions a special type of feelings develop, which we cannot express in words so the expression could be in any form. But the main thing is the expression. God has expressed Himself by Creation, by creating this Creation. While the Creation has to express its gratitude by glorifying Him, and this play must go on eternally. It's the most beautiful play. Those who indulge into this play lead an eternal life. That life is unending, never breaks and binds the whole universe with its beautiful music. "</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"You needed a Mother to look after you, to care for you and to be able to transform you with lot of wisdom. So every birthday I find that Sahaja Yogis are also expanding their hearts and realizing that they are no more drops but they are part and parcel of the Ocean.<br>
And that the Ocean itself is going to strengthen them and look after them. It's the Ocean that is going to nourish them. And the same Ocean is going to guide them. So the connection between a drop and an Ocean has to be fully established. So the limitations of a drop have to be absolutely dissolved into the greatness of the Ocean.<br>
<b>With care and with nice things to say we can improve the depth of the collectivity, and with sincere desire to be collective. The desire to be collective has to be very sincere.</b><br>
So, this expanse of your being will start.<br>
The first thing is needed: a sincerity to yourself."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen"><b>O Param-pūjya Śhrī Mātājī Nirmalā Devī,<br>
Out of the Highest Realm of Divinity, You have come on this Earth only because of Your infinite love, compassion and benevolence.<br>
Your powers, which created all the universes, are insurmountable.<br>
Your completeness is such that everything that exists, that has existed and shall ever exist is contained within Your Indescribable Being.<br>
Despite that, O Supreme Mother, out of Your immeasurable love, You assumed a form similar to ours, to give us guidance, protection, and salvation </b></font><br>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"As you know, I have so many children all over the world, apart from the one[s] whom I actually physically gave birth. We have to think of all those, today, who are away from us, thousands of miles, praying to God Almighty for their spiritual ascent.<br>
One has to only pray for the spiritual ascent. Because as you ascend, you get all the rest of it.<br>
Because you do not ascend, you not ... you do not get what is needed. That's why there are problems. And even today I had to solve some problems before I could come to Pūjā.<br>
But if you decide that, `We have to ascend spiritually within us,' then everything that you have to receive, all the blessings that God wants to shower upon you, to make you the citizen of His Great Kingdom, where you are no more judged, you are no more chastised, you are no more put to any test, but where you'll reside in Eternal Love of God and in His glory.<br>
......<br>
<b>First of all: you have to know you are Prophets and you must know that I am the Holy Ghost. I'm the Ādi Śhakti. I'm the one who has come on this Earth for the first time in this form to do this tremendous task. The more you will understand this, the better it will be. You will change tremendously.<br>
I knew I'll have to say that openly one day. And we have said it. But now it is you people who have to prove it, that I am that.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Many people have always asked Me that why God created this Universe. Of course, we are not supposed to ask questions to God.</b> It's easy to ask questions to Mātājī when She is giving a lecture. But God is a person who is beyond questions. And why He created Universe is something like why I wore all these ornaments. As I am not habituated of wearing ornaments, but I have to do it. I have to do it just to please you people, or we can say that God created this Earth, just to please His own children, just to make them happy, just to make them enter into the Kingdom of God, to give all that what He has got.<br>
So He had to create this creation in such a way, that He could create His own image, reflect it, and make it enjoy itself."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Nice to see today so many Sahaja Yogis looking like beautiful lotus flowers, as the Blossom Time is filled with the fragrance of your beauty.<br>
<b>It is such a pleasure for Me to be your Mother, and to be able to communicate the Divine, the Powers of Divine, the Beauty of Divine, to you. It was never possible before, as you know. Everyone tried their level best, but nobody could achieve it, to communicate that beauty.</b><br>
As you know, Sahaja Yoga, or this Mahā Yoga, is a very unique system: it never existed before. It has come into existence, of course, I should say that because the Parabrahma decided to take a form, but you also all decided to come on this Earth to receive the blessings. It cannot be possible to do anything with one hand.<br>
The beauty of Sahaja Yoga is great, no doubt, which I'm sure, very soon people will realize. That this is the only way."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So today I am asking for two things from you. It is a funny thing that Mother has to ask for a gift.<br>
The first gift you have to give is that you should express peacefulness through your own character.</b> But it does not mean that you should be people who are timid, or people who are morbid or who tolerate nonsense. No, but the people who are peaceful resistance. You are not afraid of anything. You are not going to bow down to anything, compromise with anything, but you have that sort of a temperament you should develop and express -- is very important.<br>
<b>And the second one is that this peace and all this should express your love. Love to others.</b>"</font><br>
