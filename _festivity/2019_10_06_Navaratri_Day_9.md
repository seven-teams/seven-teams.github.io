<font color="DarkRed">"Today we have gathered here to do the Pūjā of the Devī. The Devī has many forms, but is the embodiment of the Śhakti. Ādi Śhakti gives Śhakti to all these embodiments and so there are many Goddesses we have.<br>
At different times they came on this Earth and did all that was necessary for the ascent of people who were seekers. Especially the one we know of, Jagadambā, the Durgā. She was trying to protect all the Seekers of Truth and to destroy all evil forces, because without the ascent of human beings they do not know the Truth, and that’s why whatever they try to do is a mental projection, and this mental projection, if it is not substantiated by Truth, by dharma, it declines."</font><br>

<font color="MidNightBlue"><b>What is Your prowess to be compared to?<br>
Where can one find this beauty (of Yours) most charming, (yet) striking fear in enemies?<br>
Compassion in heart and relentlessness in battle are seen,<br>
O Devī, <br>
O Bestower of boons, only in You in all the three worlds!</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Now Pūjā also people will do – just Pūjā of mine, forgetting that I am there. When you sing also, you are singing praise of Me and I am sitting before you. Doesn’t happen that way. You just sing because it is music. There should be a feeling that you are sitting before Me and singing My praise. So, identification is still there, that you are singing praises to Devī. Devī is who? That bridge has to be crossed. If you see Me and then you penetrate through Me, then it is better."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Whenever you call a Brahmin for the Pūjā of the Goddess, he always denies, he doesn’t want to do it, because he gets into fits and something happens to him. So we have to have the status to worship the Goddess, you see. That’s why this song is there, “Pūjana kā adhikār. dījiye” – means, “You give us the right to worship You.” See, so it’s not an easy thing to do the worship of the Goddess, and there is a testing going on.<br>
Now please put full attention on the Pūjā, and don’t worry about what is happening outside. You can’t do the Pūjā them you have to be relaxed, otherwise you can’t do Pūjā – absolutely relaxed."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So you should become sat guṇī. In sat guṇa, the highest quality is, Śhaṅkarāchārya, Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya was asked, “Which is the greatest quality?” He said “Devī Bhakti, Mother’s Bhakti.” She is Devī your Mother is the Devī. Understanding that you should do Her bhakti. In that bhakti, there should not be any falsehood. The first quality, the highest quality, if it is seen in a human being from his heart, all his bad qualities will be destroyed, he will get light and attain Mokṣha [liberation]. That is why Śhaṅkarāchārya has always praised the Devī. In the beginning, He has described a lot, written lots of books like Vivekachūḍāmaṇi, etc. Lastly, He said that, “By only pleasing the Devī one can get everything, then why do these things? Why to do debates? Why to do discourses and break one’s head? Just praise the Devī and you will get whatever one wants."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">This Pūjā is very special, many will go deep and receive tremendous blessings.<br>
But first make your attention steady.<br>
In your attention pray for peace, ‘Mother, please bestow peace upon me.’ Pray for peace so that you may spread peace in the Universe.<br>
Then Joy will come. Joy cannot come without Peace."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Now you have had nine Pujas here and out of these nine Pujas have we improved more, have we got more? Did we fill ourselves more with greater love, with greater joy, with greater understanding and with greater satisfaction? This is the last day, so you have to think like that, then tomorrow is the day of jubilation. Because we have done what? That is what. So today you should go and make a complete picture of yourself. What have I got in these nine days? What have I got? Let us see, have I got this? have I got that? All these things, you should just within yourself see and then enjoy that you have got all these things. It is the victory. <b>Tomorrow is the day of victory. That you have become victorious about yourself and about your ignorance. You have won yourself and you've won over the ignorance, the darkness of ignorance. This is what is tomorrow message.</b>"</font><br>
