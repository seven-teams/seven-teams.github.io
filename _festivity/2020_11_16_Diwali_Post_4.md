<font color="DarkRed">"It is very important to understand that without transformation you have no meaning. Whatever you are, do not identify yourselves with that, but whatever you want to be, try to be that.<br>
When you become one with the Spirit, all your problems will be solved.<br>
Sahaja Yoga is different from the other Yogas because it begins with Self-realization instead of this being the unobtainable dream of a distant goal.<br>
Without dharma, you cannot have the ascent. And the cleanliness of your being depends on how much dharma you follow religiously.<br>
The object of Sahaja Yoga is basically to become and experience the spiritual Self which is the true Self."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is a day we celebrate in India where relationship between brothers and sisters have to be established.</b><br> 
They’re very pure. Brothers and relationsh... sisters relationship is without any lust or greed.<br>
Is pure relationship, where the sister prays for the protection of the brother and brother play ... pray ... prays for the self-sufficiency of the kṣhema, well-being, of the sister."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Then the second day is also very important. Is the second day is the moon, that is the moon came out of the sea. According to this mythology, the Lakshmi came out of the sea and with Her this moon came out, which was only a two-day-old moon, the new moon but a two-day-old moon, and this was regarded as the brother of Lakshmi, because they were born at the same time from the sea. So He is the brother of Lakshmi. It's all symbolic; this is very, very symbolic."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Now the last day is very important, is a very universal day I should say, called as Bhāī Dūj, this day, or they call it also in Marathi Bhāūbīj, different names. The brothers and sisters day. Now the brothers’ and sisters’ relationship has to be very, very strong. And the purity of that relationship is to be maintained.<br>
It is not necessary that you should be born as brothers and sisters, not necessary. But you are born, because if you are realized Souls you are born as brothers and sisters. So that purity must be maintained in the society of Sahaja Yoga. Very important, that we should try to develop this situation that brothers and sisters are something very pure. Their relationships are very pure. And they should not be at all challenged. It is so much so that even if you call somebody your brother, he is your brother and the more you develop this relationship, the better your left Viśhuddhi will be. Because left Viśhuddhi is the relationship with God as a brother or with a Goddess as a sister."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"But for a gṛuhalakṣhmī, the brother is very important.<br>
<b>And the brotherhood and sisterhood is the base of our Sahaj Yoga collectivity.</b> If you understand that brotherhood and sisterhood is love which is very pure, there is no expectation, is just love: is giving love and taking love. And Absolute Purity within us should exist between our relationships when we call them as Sahaj Yogi brothers and sisters. And as there is understanding, complete understanding between the brother and sister, in a family, one has to know we are all part and parcel of a family, born out [of] the same Mother.<br>
Nobody has to shoot off, you know, nobody has to become something great, nobody has to correct others, nobody has to uh say that, ‘I’m something unique.’ All of you have to work it out together and find out the solution working out together, in complete friendship and unison. Anyone who cuts off himself and goes out or becomes anything else, goes out of circulation and useless for Sahaj Yoga. Such a person is completely useless: the one who tries to get out of the family. All of you have to be supporting as each other, helping to each other, not shouting at each other, [not] getting angry with each other, trusting each other, not finding faults, treating each other with respect [unclear and love].
This is the most important thing, which Sahaj Yogis don’t understand, that you are Saints and you have to respect each other."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"And I have described to you how Śhrī Lakṣhmī is a lady and in Her left hand She has got two lotuses and the right, one lotus, and right hand another lotus on top, which shows a person who is balancing. 
She’s balancing on a lotus. Imagine. She’s standing on a lotus.<br> 
That means She is balancing. And She’s balancing, She’s standing there and <b>She is holding two lotuses in Her hand showing that She’s like a lotus.</b>"</font><br>
