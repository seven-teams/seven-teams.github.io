<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we have gathered here to do the Pūjā of the Śhakti.</b> Till today many Saints have written and spoken a lot about the Śhakti. Those who could not explain the Śhakti in their texts they did it in their poems.<br>
Additionally, they learned different meanings of the Śhakti. But one thing probably we may not know is that inside every human beings, these powers are present in a dormant state, and all these powers human beings can awaken within himself. All these powers which are present in the dormant state are endless, nor anybody can guess their limit because as an example there are 35 crores [350 million] Deities seated within you. Apart from that, there are several powers that are running them, but at least we can understand that the Self-realization that we received today, certainly <b>some Śhaktis must have worked this out. Without this work, you cannot get your Self-realization. When we are receiving our Self-realization we think that we got it very easily</b>."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we’ll worship the Śhakti</b> - very much needed – the Śhakti who destroyed all the devils, all the rākṣhasas.<br> 
That is what you are going to worship today – the Śhakti within you and without.<br> 
It’s your desire which is going to work. So today we are going to worship the Śhakti Itself – Mahākālī.<br>
May God bless you."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today it’s such a great day for Me to be with you all, again this year. It’s so very joyous and full of fragrance. <b>Today we have decided to have a Pūjā of Śhakti that is the Power, that is the Devī.</b> You know within us there are many Powers of Mahākālī, Mahāsaraswatī, Mahālakṣhmī, Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
All these Powers are there for us to ascent. If these Powers are properly used and understood, then your ascent can be permanent. Once you achieve your ascent and enter into the Kingdom of God, all these Powers get enlightened. And these Powers which are enlightened are absolutely filled with Love."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"The way different Deities manifest themselves to do certain thing, similarly <b>the Goddess manifests Herself as Their Power, Śhakti. Without the Śhakti no Deity could work out things</b>, whether it is Incarnation of Rāma, Kṛiṣhṇa, Jesus Christ or anyone else. All of them had a Goddess as Their Power (Śhakti). That is the reason so much importance and respect is given to mother in our country. Indians are worshipers of Śhakti, irrespective of all the differences and problems. They are the worshipers of Śhakti.<br>
Those who follow Viṣhṇu or Śhiva are also worshipers of Śhakti because Śhakti is the Mother and mother belongs to all. Mother is a very significant institution in our country. So we should always respect the mother."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"While you can see that once the Ambā, <b>this Kuṇḍalinī who is the reflection of the Holy Ghost, of the Ādi Śhakti within you, when She rises through these different chakras, She gives them power because She’s the Power, She’s the Śhakti.</b> She is the Desire Power of Sadāśhiva. She is the Complete Power of Sadāśhiva. And so She gives the power totally to every chakra, by which all these chakras are enlightened and all the Deities are awakened. Supposing we have no power of life, we’ll be like dead people. So these centers when they receive this Power, this Śhakti, then they are awakened."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>We are the worshipers of Śhakti.</b> Here we are Śhakti Dharmi [religiously devoted to Śhakti] and many kings have been worshiping Ādi Śhakti. Everyone has different Deities and the names of each Deity is different. <b>The name of the Deity of this place is also different, it is Gangaur.</b> But Ādi Śhakti was once born in Rajasthan state whose name was Satī Devī. It is Her Grace that we find our culture the dharma of wife, dharma of husband, dharma of ruling, etc. which are nourished by Her Śhakti.<br>
You all know the story of Satī Devī, I don’t have to tell you in new way but she was Gangaur. She was married and while She was returning after marriage with Her husband some of the bad elements surrounded them and killed Her husband. She came out of the bride’s carriage, took the Rudra Form and destroyed all of them who attacked Her husband and then She finished Herself also. We should see in this that since childhood till marriage She did not disclose that She was Mahāmāyā in any condition."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>They have one festival called Gangaur: that is a thing where they uh uh worship Gaurī.</b> That's the biggest festival where the Queen ... Mahārāṇī has to worship the Gangaurī: is a statue, which goes round the whole of Jaipur state and everybody celebrates it. Is regarded as the biggest festival. So she, in the morning she came and touched My Feet. And she said, ``Mother, can I'p worship You?" I said, ``Why?" ``Because You are my Gangaur, really. That's just a statue." She made Me stand the same way, she did everything, she made Me eat betel. Uh I don't eat all that, but he, she said, ``You have to, You are Gangaur, so You have to eat it." [Smiles, laughter.] And she worshiped Me and all her whole rituals she did for about f... forty-five minutes, and the ... then she said, ``Now I'll go and worship that statue."</font><br>
