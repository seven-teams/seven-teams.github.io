<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is a very great day, I must say, to celebrate Sahasrāra, the Pūjā of Sahasrāra.</b><br>
It’s a very unique thing that has happened, that your Sahasrāras were opened out.<br>
......<br> 
So it’s a very great day because collectively this Sahasrāra has been opened. Every one of you have got it. Also all over the world, you have many people who have got their Sahasrāras open. Of course, we need many more for them to understand what is this great event of such a collective opening of Sahasrāra.<br>
Some have grown very much, after getting their Realization, very much. They have understood Sahaja Yoga very well, and they have developed their depth, and their consciousness is really a great awareness of Oneness with the Divine.<br>
<b>To be one with the Divine is the greatest blessing for human beings.</b>"</font><br>

O Divine Mother, Your unbounded love is the bliss of Liberation</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So this Sahasrāra Day or, we can say, on the day the Sahasrāra was opened out, is a very important one, it’s very subtle.</b> We just know about the Kuṇḍalinī, that She’s coiled up in three and a half, and She’s lying in the triangular bone known as sacrum. But we don’t know what She works, how She works, what happens to us. She rises in six centers and breaks the seventh ... I should say She breaks the sixth center because Gaṇeśha’s center doesn’t play any role. So when She breaks the sixth center, which is the
Sahasrāra, then She connects you to the All-pervading Power of Divine Love.<br>
But what is this Divine Love? What does this do? It is the Energy of the Mother. We can say it is the Energy of Ādi Śhakti, which is all over, works through vibrations. But what are these vibrations? It’s a very subtle energy that starts flowing through your Sahasrāra. All the thousand petals of the Sahasrāra get slowly enlightened and it starts flowing throughout your body, throughout your hands, feet, throughout your body. And the more you are ... I mean your attention is, on the Sahasrāra, the more it works faster."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>Viśhveśhwarī twam paripasi viśhwam</b><br>
O Queen of the universe You are its guardian.<br>
<b>Viśhwātmā dharayas'iti vishwam</b><br>
In the form of the Universe You are its receptacle.<br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, it’s a great day because Sahasrāra Day and Mother’s Day have come together. It’s a very Sahaj happening, I think, and that is what we have to understand, how Sahasrāra and motherhood go together.</b><br>
Sahasrāra was definitely opened and Mother had to do it, because formerly those people who came on this Earth tried to teach people about dharma, to bring them to the central path, to the straightforward path of ascent. They tried everything, whatever way They thought was good for a particular community, particular area, particular country. They talked about it and lots of books came out of it, but instead of all these books creating people of religious, spiritual and a united nature, created people who were all against each other."</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So, opening Sahasrāra was the most important part of the evolutionary process.</b> All the evolution process brought human beings to what level? We had wars, we had all kinds of silly programs by which we really ruined the so many countries, so many people.<br>
Now, when you are one with that All-pervading Power – it’s a pure power, it’s a nirmal power, absolutely pure power – that gives you complete sense and complete understanding as to how you should move, how you should live and what you should have. This is what is Self-realization, they say."</font><br>

<p style=" text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed"><b>The Mother is everything</b> — She is our consolation in sorrow, our hope in misery, and our strength in weakness.<br>
She is the source of love, mercy, sympathy, and forgiveness. And this Earth is the Mother of the trees and flowers.<br>
It produces them, nurses them, and weans them.<br>
The trees and flowers become kind mothers of their great fruits and seeds.<br>
And the Mother, the prototype of all existence, is the Eternal Spirit, full of beauty and love.</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"It’s very gratifying to see so many Sahaja Yogis have come to celebrate the Sahasrāra Day.<br>
Without breaking the Sahasrāra, we could not have achieved the ascent en masse. But the Sahasrāra which is the brain has gone into too much complications in the West. And the thoughts are very much twisted, one upon the other. To keep Sahasrāra open should be very easy if the Western brains could understand and be aware about your Mother.<br>
<b>When your Mother is the Deity of Sahasrāra, the only way to be able to keep the Sahasrāra open has to be complete surrendering.</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is a unique combination of Mother’s Day in many countries and Sahasrār Day for Sahaj Yogis. I think this is the most important day in the history of human evolution</b> because all other events, Incarnations and ventures in the spiritual atmosphere have been of no avail. On the contrary, they have gone into a kind of a cocoon which has no door, banging themselves against the walls, creating problems out of something very auspicious and extremely, beautifully spiritual.<br>
Is not possible to find faults with the Incarnations in whose names all the religions came in. But this cocoon is the Mahāmāyā, I think, cocoon is the one which is ignorance. We can say that Māyā ... Mahāmāyā does not create it. This cocoon is created by the basic ignorance of human beings and their misidentifications."</font><br>
