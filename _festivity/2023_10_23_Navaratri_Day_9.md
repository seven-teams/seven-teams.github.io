<font color="DarkRed">"Today is <b>the last day of Navarātri</b>. And this should be the culminating point for all of us. As you see, within us lie, as you know that there are seven chakras for you ascent and two above it. So all these Nine Chakras are to be crossed in this lifetime. That should be your destiny.<br>
But if you people go only on the Āgñyā move on Āgñyā, you cannot rise any higher. People have been lost on that chakra. So, that's a very important chakra for ......<br>
Sixth, Ṣhaṣhṭhī of the Goddess, is regarded as a very important thing and they say that, `Goddess comes on a nāv,' on a boat, Calcutta [Kolkata] people believe it because the sixth day is very big to cross it. That is what today is the problem with all of us that we have this sixth day still sitting on our heads and we cannot get out it. So to come to the ninth stage, though we may do Pūjā, we may do anything, but we are still on the sixth. So it is just outwardly that we are doing Pūjā. Seventh day is the day, where I am there. But 7th and 8th and 9th has to be achieved by crossing your sixth."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now you are worshiping today the Durgā, or all the nine forms of the Goddess.</b> She came nine times on this Earth, according to this, that She fought all the people who were destroying the seekers, who were trying to make a mess of their lives. And these tortured Saints, when they prayed to the Goddess -- because none of the Gods could do anything, and Sadāśhiva is never interfering with what the Goddess is doing -- so they worshiped the Bhagavatī, and then the Incarnation of Hers came nine times, according to the need of the time."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"The siddhis that people attempt to achieve are: Aṇima, Laghima, Mahima, Īśhatva, Vaśhitva, Prākāmya, Bhukti, Icchā, Prāpti, Mukti. Aṇima is to become like a small particle. Laghima is to become small, Mahima is to have a big form, Īśhatva is to create Gods out of human beings, Vaśhitva is the attraction, Prākāmya is the manifestation, Bhukti is the enjoyment, [Icchā] fulfillment of desire. Prāpti is the attainment, Mukti is the salvation.<br>
<b>These are all the siddhis that Sahaja Yogis can have."</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"These are the things you must understand. Why are you doing that and try to get rid of it and try to improve yourself, be alert and to receive it. Receive it as much as you can. This is what is the Pūjā is made for.<br>
Now you have had nine Pūjās here and out of these nine Pūjās have we improved more, have we got more? Did we fill ourselves more with greater love, with greater joy, with greater understanding and with greater satisfaction?<br>
<b>This is the last day, so you have to think like that, then tomorrow is the day of jubilation.</b> Because we have done what? That is what. So today you should go and make a complete picture of yourself. What have I got in these nine days? What have I got? Let us see, have I got this? Have I got that? All these things, you should just within yourself see and then enjoy that you have got all these things. It is the victory. Tomorrow is the day of victory. That you have become victorious about yourself and about your ignorance."</font><br>

<b>This is just a sort of a thanksgiving to God that, 'God, you have given me so much.' You have to wear the best, like in Pūjā if you see ladies here wear all their nose rings and all their ornaments and everything, in the temple</b>, everything they wear, and in the same way, men also wear their very clean dresses, very clean things, whatever they have, they wear simple clean dresses, whatever they have but no ostentatious, it is just a thing by which you express. <b>The God has given this, 'O God, I thank you.'</b> "</font><br>

Who is three-eyed, Who wears red clothes, and<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So, you have to understand that you cannot rationalize the Pūjā. You should have the maximum advantage on your chakras.</b> For that, you must fully just concentrate on the Pūjā and how the Wind is blowing. And the Wind will see to it that they drive out all the clouds.<br>
So your only work is, or your only method is just to concentrate on the Pūjā and witness. You are a Seer. Seer has double meaning. The one who sees only, just sees, and is only knowledge is a Seer. Without any thought, without any reaction, just sees and absorb[s] automatically, spontaneously -- is the Seer. And so, that is the best way to perform a Pūjā.<br>
For Me sometimes it's burdensome, because there should be some parity between you and the Deities. Some balance must be there."</font><br>
