<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Today is a very important day for all of us, Sahaja Yogis, because today Śhrī Gaṇeśha was born.</b> Śhrī Gaṇeśha is whom we worship and because of whom we got our Realization. However much you may remember Him, until you do not know His special qualities, you cannot attain Him. His special quality is that He is the Embodiment of Purity (Śhuddha Swarūp) and Complete Master of the Universe. He is the Incarnation of the Supreme, of Brahman.<br>
By coming into this world He has created music (saṅgīt), rhythm (tāl) and notes (sur). By His Grace only people become one with music (tallīn) [engrossed]. A small boy who came into the world and did such great work! He has given so many things to everyone and even today He is active. Śhrī Gaṇeśha's Pūjā, no matter how much you do it, it is not enough. A lot of people say we don't see Śhrī Gaṇeśha, even after worshiping Him so much, we do not attain Him. "</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"Today is a very big day, because the actual Pure Spirit has taken birth today. And He already had such an eternal state, that many people could not comprehend it or write about it. They wrote only what they understood, but now that you are realized you can understand that by the Power of Śhrī Gaṇeśha's name you can get your Realization. By taking His name alone any disease or any pain will disappear. He is eternal. He is always present within us, when you get your Realization, you can feel Him."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Śhrī Gaṇeśha was made out of the, they say, it is a beautiful poetic way of saying it, out of the mud that was covering the Mother Pārvatī</b> or you can say the Gaurī at that time. Because She was not married in the sense that She was a virgin just finished her marriage and She was to meet her husband and this virgin wanted to have a bath before meeting her husband, so She cleanses her hands properly and makes this Deity of Śhrī Gaṇeśha which is bestowed on this center. If you really develop your proper insight through meditation you can see Śhrī Gaṇeśha settled down there very clearly.<br>
<b>Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the Embodiment of Innocence</b> and that’s why He is a child, that’s why His head is that of an elephant because an elephant being an animal doesn’t grow into ego and superego like human beings do. That’s why He is a child. <b>He is the Embodiment of Childhood</b> and He incarnated on this Earth once which is described in Devī Bhāgavat[am] if you read as Mahāviṣhṇu."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So I have to make a very simple announcement today, that on this day of Śhrī Gaṇeśh,<br>
all My children, who are born like Śhrī Gaṇeśh only, in the same pattern, should become dynamic like Him,<br> 
innocent like Him, great like Him, working twenty-four hours.<br>
This little Child is working throughout the day and night to give you this Source of Joy.<br>
May God bless you all."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"But when Pārvatī made Śhrī Gaṇeśha, He was the Son of Pārvatī alone. There was no Father. Pārvatī Herself wanted to have a child of Her own. There were angels who were dedicated either to Viṣhṇu or to Śhiva, like gaṇas were dedicated to Śhiva alone. So, She wanted to have Her own Son who can permeate Her Powers on this Earth.<br>
So to begin with when the Śhakti created this universe and Sadāśhiva was watching Her creation, the first thing She created on this Earth was innocence and the Embodiment of that Innocence was Śhrī Gaṇeśha.
The whole Universe was covered with innocence, which we call as Oṃkāra. This innocence protected all the creation of the world and penetrated into all that is matter."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"I have said a lot about Śhrī Gaṇeśha and His importance in our life.<br>
He is the giver of wisdom. But this wisbom ... wisdom comes from our innocence, innocence that is innate within us. As children, we are innocent, but as we grow we start exerting ourselves in a manner that we start losing our innocence.<br>
We lose it in two ways. Once we have lost our innocence, we cannot believe that others could be innocent. Another is that we think innocence is not important.<br>
Innocence is the sustainance [sustenance], is the basis of spirituality. If a person doesn’t have innocence, we [he] cannot rise in spirituality.<br>
<b>That’s why the first job of Sahaja Yoga is to establish Śhrī Gaṇeśha within you, to awaken Him. As soon as the Kuṇḍalinī awakens, you must know that Śhrī Gaṇeśha comes into being. Without His awakening within you, Kuṇḍalinī cannot be raised.</b>"</font><br>

<p style=" text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b> The Oṃkāra? Is the first sound.<br>
When the Śhakti departed from Sadāśhiva, from the God Almighty<br>
– His Power, His Desire departed – it made the first sound: that’s the first Child, we say, of God.<br>
That’s Oṃkāra. A-u-m is the thing, and these are the Three Powers which are represented as Mahākālī, Mahālakṣhmī, Mahāsaraswatī.<br>
And also all these are combined together to form Śhrī Gaṇeśh.</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"...... the Principle of Gaṇeśha is extremely subtle, is the subtlest of subtle. And it exists in everything, that it exists in the matter in the form of vibrations. There is no matter which is without vibrations. It has vibrations which are seen even in the atoms and also in the molecules of all matter that has existed.<br>
So Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the first one who was established in the matter, as well. As a result, we can see, He exists in the Sun, He exists in the Moon, He exists in the whole Universe, in the whole Creation, and He continues to exist in human beings also. Only the human beings have capacity to somehow or other cover up your – the innocence. Otherwise, animals are innocent. Human beings have the freedom; if they want, they can cover up their innocence, they can shut down the doors of Śhrī Gaṇeśha and say that He does not exist. They can cloud it. And that is why we find among human beings that they are doing so many horrible things, avoiding the existence of Śhrī Gaṇeśh.<br>
But He acts. He acts in a way that He shows natural reserves of our wrongdoings. Like if you do things which are not pleasing to Śhrī Gaṇeśh, He goes up to a point, forgives you up to a point, and then He starts emerging out as diseases, as physical diseases, and in women, it becomes a mental disease. Also, it can create problems in the nature. The natural catastrophes are also only the curse of Śhrī Gaṇeśha. When people start doing wrong things, behaving in a wrong manner, collectively, then the natural catastrophes come to teach them a lesson."</font><br>
