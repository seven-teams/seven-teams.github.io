Jai Śhrī Mātājī!<br>
Today is Śhārad Pūrṇimā or Kojāgirī Pūrṇimā.  This is a harvest festival celebrated on the Full Moon Day of the Hindu lunar month of Āśhvin (September–October). It marks the end of the monsoon. There is a traditional celebration of the moon.</font>

<font size="+0"><b>"In 82, 83 or 84 we celebrated Kojāgirī Pūrṇimā with Śhrī Mātājī at Hall in Saneguruji Vidyalay, Dadar, Mumbai where weekly Saturday meeting took place. She prepared milk also for all of us.
She mentions in that talk "Goddess comes to everybody's house late at night on that day She ask "Kojagarti" in Sanskrit mean who has not awakened yet."<br>

<p>
<font size="+0"><b>The Significance of this festivity:</b><br>
On this auspicious day of Śhārad Pūrṇimā or Kojāgirī, moonlights are filled with Amrut which clears negativities and all the diseases.<br>
On this day it is believed that Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī comes on the earth and goes about from place to place asking, "Who is awake?" ("Kojagarti") and She showers Her blessings on those She finds awake.<br>
Hence, the night is spent in festivity, singing, and praising in honor of the Goddess. So people sit in the moonlight singing bhajans in praise of the Devī. Thus this Kojāgirī night in India is celebrated customarily by observing a night vigil and other rituals.<br>
All the Sahaja yogis on this night collectively sing bhajans/praises to Śhrī Mātājī enlightening our powers within.
Popularly on this day milk is boiled along with rice and made into  ‘kheer’ – and dry fruits are added to make it delicious that is offered to the Devī and consumed.</font>
