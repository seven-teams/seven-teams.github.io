<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Is a great thing we are worshiping today Guru Nāṇaka, that's Me, that may you become Great Guru Nāṇakas.</b><br>
All of Them were created by Ādi Śhakti. All these Gurus were created by Her. And today I say that you all become as great as Guru Nāṇaka, as great as Moses, as great as Sāī Nāth, as great as Nāṇaka, Janaka, Muhammad. All [of you] have to become as great as all these Great Incarnations. Just desire, have earnestness in you and alertness to achieve it."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is a special day of Guru Nāṇaka's birthday.</b><br>
Uh we have celebrated one Guru Pūjā uh-uh-uh ... and the, as you know that Guru Nāṇak was also the Incarnation of the Primordial Master, the same Spirit came on this Earth. And the He's the One who tried to re-establish the work of Muhammad.<br>
Muhammad was the Incarnation of the same Spirit, the Primordial Master. He came on this Earth to establish the religion.<br>
Islam is the name of that religion, is the religion of every Sahaja Yogi, of every Christian, of every Hindu. We all belong to One Religion which believes in expanding our ourne ... awareness to the new perception of collectivity: from human level to the higher level, where you can perceive and manifest the Divine Power. This is the religion we are following.<br>
<b>All the religions were established on this Earth to create the seekers. You are the seekers: you are the Men of God. Now, all of you have to become Prophets. And to become Prophets, today's Sahaja Yoga has taken the form of Mahā Yoga. All of you have to become Prophets.</b>"</font><br>

<b>"See the brotherhood of all mankind as the highest order of yogis, conquer your own mind, and conquer the world."<br>

<p>
<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Today is the birthday of Śhrī Guru Nāṇaka.</b> It is being celebrated throughout the world with so much of zeal that I have not seen in India. For the first time it has been advertised in so many papers and by different means.<br>
Guru Nāṇaka always talked of Sahaja Yoga. ``Everything else," He said, ``is just showing off." About religion He said that, "Observing fasts, going on pilgrimage, etc., are just meant to show off. Now you have to discover the power that is within you and establish it." Guru Nāṇaka kept on repeating the same thing again and again.<br>
......<br>
But Guru Nāṇaka always talked of the Spirit. He explained it very clearly, but no one heeded what he wrote. They will just put a finger on the couplet and read it out. Could we understand him this way? If we go through his writings properly and absorb it, then the whole śhabda jālam [web of words], in which most of the people are caught, will come to an end. See the condition of Sikhs!<br>
Without looking within and experiencing the innate energy, how could one follow Sikh religion? Only this is the teaching of Guru Nāṇaka, this is what is called `Sikh' [learning]. All the Saints of that age had the discretion to know who is a Saint and who is not. All the gurus incorporated their poems and experiences in Guru Grantha and that is why Guru Grantha is revered so much. Only the renowned gurus contributed to it. They were so spiritual that they did churning of all the religious Scriptures and put the substance in Guru Grantha.<br>
That is what we do in Sahaja Yoga. <b>We do not follow any particular Saint or Incarnation; we respect all of them and strike a balance.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Muhammad Sāhib Himself was born [again] as our Great Guru, Guru Nāṇaka.</b> Guru Nāṇak was not a human being, He was not only a Paigambar [Prophet] but He was the Reincarnation of Ādi Guru, the Primordial Master, He was a Divine Personality. Of course, the people who were there at His time were so useless and gross people that they actually tortured His life and nobody followed Him. After His death is a different point. He also has said that it is the Primordial Mother who has created the Universe."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Then came, you know Nāṇaka who preached that there should be no enmity between Hindus and Muslims, he preached that, because he saw the Muslims behaving in such a manner, they were such fanatics and they had become so funny that he could not understand how is it? These are the people whom I have made Muslims and what are they doing here? Actually Mussulman means the person who is realized and Pīr is a person whose Realization is established so much so that he said that those who have become Mussulman should be buried and not burnt, because he thought they are all realized Souls, but Realization finished off with his son-in-law and his daughter, after that he had two sons who were great Souls who are really the Reincarnation[s] of Lav and Kuśh."</font><br>

Āratī - Gagan Main Thāl | Śhrī Guru Nāṇak Āratī (recited by Guru Nāṇak)<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNeQY2lnjko">video</a><br>
Guru Nāṇak Dev has imagined the entire universe decorated as a prayer platter on the altar of the almighty. The starting verses of the Āratī are as follows:<br>
"Gagan mein thaal, rav chand deepak bane, taarka mandal janak moti dhoop malay aan lao, pawan chavro kare sagal ban raai phulant jyoti kaisi Āratī hoye, bhavkhandana teri Āratī.<br>
anhat sabad bajant bheri kaisi Āratī hoye, bhavkhandana teri Āratī."<br>
Means: "The sky is the prayer platter, the sun and the moon are the lamps, and the stars and the constellations are the pearls and jewels. The air coming from the sandal-laden Malay mountain is the incense, the air is the fan, and the entire flora of the earth are the flowers ..... oh ... what an Āratī is it! O Destroyer of Fear!"<br>
