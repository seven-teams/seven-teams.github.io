<font color="DarkRed">"So the ascent starts evolving. In that, the play of the Devī is the Navarātri -- in your ascent -- from ages.<br>
<b>Navarātri that's why is the most important Pūjā. In Sahaja Yoga, Navarātri is the most important Pūjā, I would say.</b> Though we can say in modern Sahaja Yoga Sahasrār Day is, because that's how you started getting your Realization.<br>
But if you go to the whole historical events of evolution you'll find [that] <b>Navarātri is the one which has brought you to Sahasrāra</b>. Without the help of the Devī at different stages of your ascent, you could not have been in a position to receive your Realization. <b>So all the steps that you took in the past are today worshiped and are used for thanking the Devī for what She did to bring you down here. So it's like a thanksgiving. Without Her work, nothing could have happened.</b><br>
So when we read about the Devī, about Her Incarnations, how She came on this Earth to save Her bhaktas, people who were trying to ascend, to cross this Bhavasāgara, how She worked hard, how She fought the devils, how She cough... <b>She killed the demons, single-handed, She took upon Herself the responsibility of making the people cross the Bhavasāgara.</b><br>
Guru gave you the strength to have dharma but She is the One who brought you out. Even those who were dhārmik could not do it because of the demonic pressure. <b>She's the One who fought, single-handed, with Her Powers of destruction. In Her Love for you She fought. She brought you to this level.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"...... I must tell you that the Goddess took Her birth nine times on this Earth. And today [<font color="orange">unclear</font>] seventh, today is the seventh day of Her worship in Navarātri, Navarātri. And <b>the seventh day is ... uh ... for ... uh ... tremendous activity, tremendous ... uh ... creativity and also for prosperity".</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"On today's auspicious occasion we have gathered here. <b>Today is the seventh day of the Goddess. On the seventh day, the Devī Goddess destroyed the various rākṣhasas and sinners, because they were torturing the great Saints and Ṛiṣhis who were doing meditation and penance.</b><br>
We wonder, "Mother, why they did so much penance? What was the need?" The reason for doing it was because although human ascent was still low, yet their aspiration was very high. They aspired to achieve the Ātmā through the body. That is why they worked so hard and did penance in this place. It is due to their aspiration that today we are able to achieve this height. This does not mean that we should think that because of the blessing of Sahaja Yoga we are some great people or some specially chosen people by God. People who think like that will receive a great shock. You will see that those who are simple, innocent, and good-natured will ascend foremost and the rest will be left behind. Therefore just receiving your Realization is not the end.<br>
<b>On this auspicious occasion God Almighty has manifested all His śhaktis for your protection, benevolence and welfare. In everything God is blessing you. He wants to see you enter His Kingdom.</b> In a way it is His Desire that you should return to your Father's home and enjoy its comforts. But at least we should be worthy of it. If we are not worthy of it then how can we enter it? We should examine our worthiness and see what it is."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"She has a double role all the time, She is at two extremes. On one side She is full of joy, Giver of Joy, feels very happy when She sees Her disciple[s] are joyous. Joy is Her own quality, is Her energy.<br>
......<br>
Sahaja Yoga, as you know, has a double action, as the Mahākālī has a double action: <b>She's extremely loving, full of joy, full of happiness and She's the one who's extremely cruel, wrathful. She's the one who is the slayer of all the demons and the evil, and those people who try to do evil.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"The Heart chakra is what the Christians call the Sacred Heart. Within it is the place of Bhavānī, Durgā, which is a very great place.<br>
It is not within you to understand Durgā. That all the rākṣhasas are also Her children. The whole world is Hers. A Mother's Śhakti destroyed them for the sake of Her love for Her children. To pull one's own hands is very difficult. To give an injection to oneself with one's own hands is very difficult. <b>So to kill one's own children to protect other children is even more difficult. But to kill is a very great act of the Śhakti</b> ......"</font><br>
