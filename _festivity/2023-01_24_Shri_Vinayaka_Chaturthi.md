<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Śhrī Gaṇeśha was made out of the, they say, it is a beautiful poetic way of saying it, out of the mud that was covering the Mother Pārvatī</b> or you can say the Gaurī at that time. Because She was not married in the sense that She was a virgin just finished her marriage and She was to meet her husband and this virgin wanted to have a bath before meeting her husband, so She cleanses her hands properly and makes this Deity of Śhrī Gaṇeśha which is bestowed on this center. If you really develop your proper insight through meditation you can see Śhrī Gaṇeśha settled down there very clearly.<br>
<b>Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the Embodiment of Innocence</b> and that’s why He is a child, that’s why His head is that of an elephant because an elephant being an animal doesn’t grow into ego and superego like human beings do. That’s why He is a child. <b>He is the Embodiment of Childhood</b> and He incarnated on this Earth once which is described in Devī Bhāgavat[am] if you read as Mahāviṣhṇu."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is a very important day for all of us Sahaja Yogis because today Shrī Gaṇesha was born.</b> Shrī Gaṇesha is whom we worship and because of whom we got our realization. However much you may remember Him, until you do not know His special qualities, you cannot attain Him. His special quality is that He is the embodiment of purity (shuddha swarūp) and complete Master of the Universe. He is the incarnation of the Supreme, of Brahman.<br>
By coming into this world He has created music (sangeet), rhythm (tāl), and notes (sur). By His Grace, only people become one with music (talleen)(engrossed). A small boy who came into the world and did such great work! He has given so many things to everyone and even today He is active. Shrī Gaṇesha’s Pūjā, no matter how much you do it, it is not enough. A lot of people say we don’t see Shrī Gaṇesha, even after worshipping Him so much, we do not attain Him."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>But when Pārvatī made Śhrī Gaṇeśha, He was the Son of Pārvatī alone.</b> There was no Father. Pārvatī Herself wanted to have a child of Her own. There were angels who were dedicated either to Viṣhṇu or to Śhiva like gaṇas were dedicated to Śhiva alone. So, She wanted to have Her own Son who can permeate Her Powers on this Earth.<br>
So to begin with when the Śhakti created this universe and Sadāśhiva was watching Her creation, <b>the first thing She created on this Earth was innocence and the Embodiment of that Innocence was Śhrī Gaṇeśha</b>."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>You cannot feel joyous until you worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha.<br>
By worshiping Śhrī Gaṇeśha, your joy increases, you become joyous, because He is the personification of joy</b> (Ānand Swarūp).<br>
Because of this, both things are today, His birthday and His help.<br>
We take His help in any work what we do. Such is our way. But we don’t see what we have to do to awaken Him.<br>
In that direction our attention does not go. We do not feel that we should become like Him, that we should have a state in which Śhrī Gaṇeśha is awakened within us.<br>
 With which we may never venture on the wrong path.</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today, we are going to worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha.<br>
As you know, in the whole of Europe, America, England, they have lost faith in Śhrī Gaṇeśha. Nor do they care for His Powers and for His blessings. As result, all His blessings are not on these countries.<br>
The first blessing of Śhrī Gaṇeśha, which is, I think is the highest, is the wisdom, that we learn what is good for us and what is bad for us, what is constructive and what is destructive, what should we do to achieve our Self-realization. Those people who have got wisdom are very lucky people."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Today is a very big day because the actual Pure Spirit has taken birth today.</b> And He already had such an eternal state, that many people could not comprehend it or write about it. They wrote only what they understood, but now that you are realized you can understand that by the Power of Śhrī Gaṇeśha’s name, you can get your Realization. By taking His name alone any disease or any pain will disappear. He is eternal. He is always present within us, when you get your Realization, you can feel Him.
And if you are not realized, you cannot understand Him. That is why people get misled and do wrong things. But with Śhrī Gaṇeśha’s blessings, you can do so many things and neither you will feel greedy, nor will you have any problems. Because He does all the work for you."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"Is so simple to establish Śhrī Gaṇeśh within you.<br>
But understand that it is vital that you people who are Sahaja Yogis should establish Śhrī Gaṇeśh, which is a silent Power within you, doesn’t talk. It’s a silent Power, which acts. Just a Power that’s dynamic, without any noise, without any show.<br>
And that is what I would say that today when I have said all these things from My heart, you the Sahaja Yogis will establish Śhrī Gaṇeśha within you. And from you, you will emit such powers that others will be able to establish their Śhrī Gaṇeśha in this country."</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"For Sahaj Yogis, it is very important, because if say, there’s a cloth or a sāṛī which is blown off by the wind, even if you can hold it on one corner, you can hold it, and after some time the whole thing can subside.<br>
And this is what has to happen actually to the world, when Sahaj Yogis will hold the sāṛī, we can call, or this Universe with their wisdom and firm faith in Sahaja Yoga.
Otherwise, they can be blown off also. If they are not rightly placed, if they are not grounded, if they are not fixed to their own enlightened faith of Sahaja Yoga,<br>
they can be blown off with this wind which is there to torture the whole world, to destroy the whole world.<br>
<b>So the responsibility of Sahaja Yogis is very important that their Gaṇeśh Principle should be all right.<br>
If it is not all right, then the whole of Sahaja Yoga movement can collapse.<br>
For ladies and for men, I have to make a humble request: that they should try to put their Śhrī Gaṇeśh in a very respectable position in their lifestyle.<br>
That should be the highest, the most important, and also every day to be remembered that we are very much blessed by Śhrī Gaṇeśh to get your Self-realization.</b>"</font><br>
