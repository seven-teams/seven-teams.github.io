<font color="DarkRed">"It’s a great day for all of us, the seekers, that the last work of the Divine, of opening the last center in the Great Primordial Being, was done on the 5th of May 1970. <b>It is the greatest event of all the spiritual happenings of the Universe. It was done with very great care and great adjustments.</b><br>
It is not in the limits of human understanding, how things are worked in the heavens. It is your fortune and God’s Love that has worked out this wondrous miracle. Without this happening, there could not have been a possibility to give [en] masse Realization to people. One could have done it for one or two persons here and there, but to give such a masse awakening could not have been possible."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"We have to understand what happens when the Sahasrāra opens.<br>
When the Kuṇḍalinī passes through the five centers it enters into the area which we call as limbic area. This area is all surrounded by thousand nerves and when these nerves get enlightened they look like flames of VIBGYOR colors, seven colors, and very mildly, beautifully shining, emitting peace. But when the Kuṇḍalinī starts emitting its vibration on the sides, all these nerves get enlightened gradually and start moving on all directions, opening the Sahasrāra. And then the Kuṇḍalinī ...<br>
... emerges out, emerges out through the fontanel bone area, which we call as Brahmarandhra. Randhra means the hole. And the Brahma is the All-pervading Power of God’s Love."</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Sahasrāra is your awareness. When it is enlightened you get into the technique of the Divine. Now there are two techniques: the technique of the Divine, and the technique that you follow. You cannot act as Divine, but you can use the Divine Power and maneuver it. For example, Divine looks after all the universal happenings. Every minutest particle is controlled by Divine. When your Sahasrāra opens out and your Kuṇḍalinī touches the fontanel bone, sort of a igniting force is ready in your Sahasrāra, and as soon as the fontanel bone area opens up through the Brahmarandhra, the Grace of your Spirit ignites that igniting force and your nāḍīs get enlightened. Not all of them, quite a lot of them; not all the length, but quite the peripheries. That's how you get your enlightenment."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"To keep the Sahasrāra open is, in a way, very easy, as well as difficult. As you have known in Devī Māhātmyam that “at Sahasrārare Mahāmāyā comes.” She’s a Mahāmāyā: not easy to recognize Her, not easy to know Her. She lives just like you. She moves just like you. And you can never make out Her real nature. She is in the form of Mahāmāyā.<br>
......<br>
<b>So, in Sahasrāra Pūjā, actually, you have to recognize your own divinity, that you are divine, by experiencing your divinity. How do you experience your divinity? That you give Realization to others.</b><br>
It’s a great experience to give Realization to others. Not only that you give Realization but you can tell about their chakras, you know what’s wrong with them. You are quite confident."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So My own effort was to take you into that beautiful arena of Sahaja, where you will be absolutely one with your Self, one with the nature, one with the ... all the people who are around you, with your own country and countries. Everywhere, in the whole atmosphere, as they say, the whole Brahmāṇḍa [universe] becomes part and parcel of you, and you are not separated from that. Then, they ... we can say the echoes – they call nināda – the echoes of your being, of your life can be easily seen, not in material advancement or in any other kind of a thing, but in the spiritual area which is the highest. Or everywhere, in every country, there have been people of that quality, and, till today, they are all remembered. In the same way, you all will be representing a very great knowledge about reality: in your life, in your creation or in your working. In every way you can do it."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Sahaja Yoga teaches how to love and adore the human body as the temple of God Almighty.</b><br>
Sahaja Yoga is the working of the Unconscious and there are some very stupid people who think they can cheat God. In return they are cheated by Sahaja Yoga, and to their surprise, find themselves outwitted.<br>
The play of Sahaja Yoga can be very mischievous, and creates many miraculous happenings as well as a great deal of uproarious humor."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>The whole world we can save. We have to save the whole world. My vision is too big, and you are My children, you are My hands.</b> I cannot ask anybody else to do it. And that’s why I have to tell you that you just be worried about the people who are around, care for them, show them love, and I’m sure they will understand that you are something really different from others.<br>
It’s not difficult, because some of the value systems in America are so much convoluted, so much perverse that if you just go against it, people will be amazed. “How are they like that?” You have capacity.<br>
<b>What I’m saying, you have powers. You are just like diamonds. Diamonds can be seen anywhere. Only thing, you should chisel out yourself a little bit. Chiseling out is very important, and that’s possible through your meditation, introspection – simple things like that.</b><br>
What am I doing for Sahaja Yoga? What am I working for Sahaja Yoga? All this has to be seen, and has to work out with great love and understanding, that our Mother wants the whole world to be Sahaja Yogi – whole world."</font><br>
