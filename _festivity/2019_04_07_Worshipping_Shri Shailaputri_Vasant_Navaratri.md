<font color="Crimson">"So this power of Gaurī has to be respected because She’s our mother; She’s our individual mother, She has given us Second Birth. She is the one who knows all about us; She’s so gentle, so kind, how She slowly rises. She doesn’t give us trouble; She takes all the trouble of penetrating through these centers and She gives us a Second Birth, because She understands everything – She knows everything; She organizes everything; She brings forth all the beauty that you are. Once you start developing that beauty within yourself, then you’ll be surprised how powerful you are, that all these things are of the same nature is the truth that you discover, is the same as the beauty, is the same as the joy. You don’t have to think that joy is separate, truth is different, beauty is different."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"In India, Navarātri falls twice in a year. Once it is in the month of Chaitra as it is today. <b>On this day Devī is worshiped as Śhailaputrī, means the daughter of Himalaya. Devī has many other names also but first of all She incarnated as Śhailaputrī in the cold of Himalayas.</b> She incarnated and whatever She was to do. She started there. Further story is known to you. [King] Dakṣha did not invite Lord Śhiva in the Havana that he performed and Śhailaputrī was the consort of Lord Śhiva. She is called Satī because She entered the Holy fire of Havana and ablated Herself. But by then Lord Śhiva reached there. He lifted her burnt up body from the fire. Burnt pieces of the body of Śhailaputrī fell at many places. All these places are considered to be Śhakti Pīṭhas, the places of worship, as there is in Vindhyāchala and many other places. Her power moves there and it is said that it Sanctifies everything. Her seventh power is considered to be the Power of Destruction. Śhakti manifested Itself on the right side as Sāvitrī and Gāyatrī but the destroying force was manifested in the center. In the form of Durgā and Her other forms manifested in Heart chakra. She is present there. If some one hurts you, confuses or disturbs you then this power will protect you and destroy your enemy. When Kuṇḍalinī rises and reaches the Heart chakra then it manifests and becomes more powerful and effective because Kuṇḍalinī is Jagadambā. In Sahaja Yoga when Kuṇḍalinī is awakened it settles in Heart chakra. It protects you and takes care of you nicely."</font><br>
