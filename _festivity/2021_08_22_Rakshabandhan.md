<font color="DarkRed">"Today in India, we celebrate a set ... special festival. <b>It is called as Rakṣhā-Bandhan. Rakṣhā means protection and bandhan means the bondage: the bondage of protection. Is a very nice, good, social custom to have this beautiful festival today.<br>
Today is the Full Moon Day, and this day what we do is to tie a band of threads around the person whom you want to protect. But it is done between brothers and sisters.</b> The sisters tie this bondage to the wrist of the brothers, and when they do that, they are putting all their love around the wrist, that it is the day for giving all their love, everything to their brother, as a protection, as a symbol of their protection through that thread. Is a very, very simple thread they use. And uh this is, has to be tied on the left-hand side. But people tie it on the right-hand side, which is a mistake. But it has to be tied on the left-hand side."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="StillBlue">"So the relationship between Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa and Viṣhṇumāyā is that of a brother and a sister, and surprisingly the other day we celebrated the Rākhī Bandhan, Rakṣhābandhan, which is the same thing as the brothers-sisters relationship. So now here we are celebrating actually the Deity which is the Sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. Later on, She was born as Draupadī, and that’s why Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa went to save Her chastity because is the brother only who is concerned about the chastity and the name of the sister."</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Now this rākhī is nothing but the Viṣhṇumāyā's Power, which protects the brother. Actually, there the brother protected Her and now the sister's love protects the brother. So the relationship between brother and sister is much more important than any other relationship because it's so pure, it's so protective, it's so loving and also it is of an equal age."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now our Viṣhṇumāyā Principle is to be always kept very alert because it helps us in many ways.</b> First of all, it helps us to pass the messages from your heart to your head. It is the one by which we integrate.<br>
Our heart and head is integrated by the Viṣhṇumāyā Principle more than the Viśhuddhi on the right side. Viśhuddhi on the right side can create collectivity, can create understanding with each other but on the left side, it helps you to keep a complete integration between your heart and your head.<br>
If there is a guilt you just think of it and analyze it. It means that there’s a struggle between you in your heart and your mind, isn’t it? Simple as that. If it was integrated you would not feel guilty. And that is why all these artificial theories that have come, all these artificial yarns that you have read, and all that, you forget it.<br>
You are a Sahaja Yogi and you have entered into the Kingdom of God – enjoy! That’s all you have to do. But you have to get to that state of enjoyment and understanding that you are above all."</font><br>

<font color="FireBrick">"This Viṣhṇumāyā is the one who has helped you because <b>She is the Sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa</b>, and because this is the domain of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, She came down here to help you.<br>
Now She’s the Sister – this must be understood very well. Now sisterly relation is a pure relationship."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Now, the Indian Sahaja Yogis have sent Me three rākhīs. This was by somebody else, but three of them, which is a very, very ... another very poetical situation. That, M... Modi has written that, "You are the protection for all of us. And a how ... what do we do ah to put this onto You? And what are we doing it?"<br>
So, they said that: <b>"All the sisters of Sahaja Yogis are sending this to be tied on all the brothers of Sahaja Yoginīs who are in Your wrist."<br> 
And that's how they've sent three -- of Mahākālī, Mahālakṣhmī, Mahāsaraswatī -- ......</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So today is the day of a very big relationship between brother and sister where a sister never feels guilty and brother never feels guilty. Sisters and brothers should never feel guilty about themselves and they should always openly tell whatever they think wrong or whatever they think is right. <b>There is no harm, a sister can always go and correct the brother, and a brother can always come and correct the sister. This is the relationship in which nobody should feel hurt and bad, because this is the purest relationship that you could think of.</b> As mother, if she tells something, the difference of age is so much that you may not understand. Maybe if the father says something the children may not understand, the difference of age is too much and also the norms that we have created of saying that there's a generation gap and all this nonsense that is also in the head. But supposing a brother and sister, if they, between themselves, understand Sahaja Yoga, they have every right to say whatever is wrong between them and work it out -- not to put it as a guilt.<br>
<b>But now with rākhī sister is even better. Now with rākhī sister we have established a beautiful atmosphere that somebody who is a brother, you cannot have any funny relationships with that person.</b> It kills all your flirtations, all your funny, funny relationships that one develops, all kinds of marriage breaking problems, and people going astray, once you have understood the principle that we have to first settle ourselves on very holy relationship with each other."<br>
<b>This is the way, in Sahaja Yoga, we establish that holy relationship.</b> And moreover, one has to see that this holy relationship gives you joy, happiness, and pleasure. It is not just a holy relationship of some force or some sort of a thing. Even if you cannot give anything to your sister, or the brother cannot do anything for the sister, doesn't matter. The relationship is in the heart, and is felt very much and when you feel it, that relationship, that sweetness of purity, of holiness, flows. I know of some people who have sacrificed such a lot for the brothers and so much for the sisters.<br>
So one has to understand this relationship is to be kept very clean, beautiful, and absolutely open -- there should be no formality in it. That a brother should go and say, 'I'm sorry,' and the sister should go and say, 'I'm sorry.' You have to be open and tell -- you should never feel bad about your brother or sister.</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed"><b>"Rākhī is Protecting Power.</b> Its bond is very strong and extremely tender because it symbolizes the noble love of sister. Customarily, tying a rākhī to someone is establishing a place of Pure Protection. However, man's ability to understand love has become so feeble that tying of rākhī has become merely a mechanical process. All beautiful human traditions become lifeless and dry formalities if there is no warmth of faith in them.<br>
......<br>
<b>Rākhī Pūrṇimā is a day of great significance. On that day you should ask for perfection, make big decisions and keep attention on high ideals. Sahaja Yogis should not destroy their attention on trifle issues. Lot of work has yet to be done."</b></font><br>
