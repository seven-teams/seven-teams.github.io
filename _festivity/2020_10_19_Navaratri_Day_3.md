<font color="DarkRed">"<b>I’ve told you before also but again today I want to tell you the significance of Pūjā. The significance is this, that when you do the Pūjā you recognize Me. By your recognition and your surrendering, the Deities get happy.</b> They’re overjoyed that you have recognized it. You are fully identified yourself that you are understanding Me in My full form, that you are coming closer to them. And I tell the brothers feeling happy when the younger ones are coming to meet. So, they start releasing My vibrations with a greater force – much greater force. You have seen that after Pūjā sometimes when you do not absorb vibrations, I get little tired because the vibrations start coming out of all the chakras and you do not absorb, so the give and take process is not balanced. The identification in the West is very slow because of mental activity. Your attachment to your mental activity and your rationality is very great. With Pūjā the vibrations try to detach you from your mental activity, from your rationality, and then you are station into the Realm of Divine Existence."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So to recognize Me, what should we do? If we recognize, then you are protected.</b><br>
...... if you could recognize Me, to understand Me, that I am Divine Personality. It’s an Incarnation. That’s all the Deities want. Then they’ll look after you in every way. They’ll give you all the powers. They’ll give you all the satisfaction, all the protection that you want."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"...... <b>the Greatest Power that is belonging to the Mother is your protection.</b> Protection from all kinds of things – all the left-hand side protections are there. They are described, as you must have learnt on the Devī Māhātmyam – what a protections She gives you. So tremendous in Her protecting power. And this protecting power gives you understanding – how kind She is and how, I should say, how very-very protective, extremely protective. She’ll guide you all the time that you should be protected – on the left side. And through Her gaṇas She looks after you. But on the right side also. Those who are on the right side, the Goddess puts Her Powers to put you right, to bring you back to normal conditions, to humble you down and make you understand that you are a child of the Mother and you have to behave like a child.<br>  
......<br>
<b>So the protection is also built in your body. By gaṇas on the left-hand side and by reactions on the right-hand side.</b> But the greatest thing is the blessings of the Mother. The way She looks after you, the way She loves you and the way She cares for you – which you should never take it for granted."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"The emblem of the Ādi Śhakti, of course you know, is a thing like this, you see, is ... we call it a ... a[n] elliptical isn't it. This is elliptical, elliptical. You all know that. But the mark of the Ādi Śhakti is the Half-moon and a star. You can put a Half-moon and a Bindu -- is a what you call a bindu? -- is a point.<br>
......<br>
But that point is a star. So, you see, the Islam follows the star, the inside, and below that is this, what you call, they call it the Moon. But that's the half mudrā, or we can call it the half ...... half of the coil. But half, according to the Western mind, half means is bad. But half is the one that takes everything within itself. You see, the one like the bottom of the sea. Bottom of the sea is always bigger than ...... the sea itself.<br>
......<br>
So this ... the Half Śhakti takes all the śhaktis into Itself. And the Bindu represents the Heart or we can say the Ātmā. So is the complete thing, is the Ādi Śhakti and the Bindu. That's the Islam seal. And in the same way this is the seal, this is the seal of the Ādi Śhakti, is a half circle. Is not even half -- we shouldn't say now first night's Moon and a star. And why this is used, because this is the thing coming from the creation, from the nature.<br>
So that also what we call Islam is nothing but is the creation of Ādi Śhakti."</font><br>

Today is the third day of Navarātri. We worship the golden complexion Goddess Chandraghanta who rides a lion or tiger. She has a half-moon shaped like a bell on Her forehead or who uses the moon as Her bell. During the battle between Her and the demons, the horrible sound produced by Her bell sent thousands of demons to hell.</font><br>
