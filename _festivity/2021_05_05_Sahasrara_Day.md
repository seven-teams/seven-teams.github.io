<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are celebrating the Sahasrāra Day.</b>
Perhaps we have not realized what a day it must have been. Without opening the Sahasrāra, God Itself was a myth, religion itself was a myth, all talk about Divinity was a myth. People believed in it but it was just a belief. And the science, as it was put forward, was about to obliterate all the value system, all the proof of God Almighty."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"When the seventh chakra was opened, all the chakras came to your Sahasrāra, and so I could manage all your chakras and all your Deities.<br>
Any Deity you ask and you get the vibrations.<br>
<b>So that proves that I am the Brahmachaitanya.<br>
The Brahmachaitanya is the Ādi Śhakti and Sadāśhiva is also in My heart.</b><br>
But since I am so much humanized, it is not so easy to find it out. If you tell this to modern human beings, they will not understand.<br>
It can only be told to Sahaja Yogis because they will understand. To bear this Truth is so difficult."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>It’s a great day for all of us, the seekers, that the last work of the Divine, of opening the last center in the Great Primordial Being, was done on the 5th of May 1970. It is the greatest event of all the spiritual happenings of the Universe.</b> It was done with very great care and great adjustments.<br>
It is not in the limits of human understanding, how things are worked in the heavens. It is your fortune and God’s Love that has worked out this wondrous miracle. Without this happening, there could not have been a possibility to give [en] masse Realization to people. One could have done it for one or two persons here and there, but to give such a masse awakening could not have been possible.<br>
As you know, in the Sahasrāra there are the seats of the seven main chakras. There are 1,000 nāḍīs or, as they call it, flames, and they all have each Sixteen Thousand Powers. Every nāḍī deals with a particular type of a person and, with the permutations and combinations of all these nāḍīs, human beings are looked after.<br>
As soon as Sahasrāra was opened, the whole atmosphere was filled with tremendous Chaitanya [vibrations]."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Sahaja Yoga was known to Me all along.</b> It is a unique knowledge with which I was born. It was not so easy to reveal it and I wanted to find out how to reveal it.
First of all, I thought that the seventh chakra must be opened, which I did, on 05th May 1970. It is a secret in a way. Formerly, the Brahmachaitanya was avyakta. It was not manifested. It was not expressed by itself, and so the people who managed to reach Brahmachaitanya somehow, by attaining ‘realization’, said – “it was nirākār kā guṇa” “you are like a drop that gets dissolved in the ocean.”<br>
No one could say, explain or tell people anything more about it. The Great Incarnations also who came out of this Great Ocean of Brahmachaitanya, tried their best to share it with the best available followers – which were very few – and introduce them to this Brahmachaitanya. But because the Brahmachaitanya was not in avyakta form, these Incarnations got dissolved in it.<br>
...... <b>Now I have come as the Incarnation of the Brahmachaitanya as a whole.</b> The sea of the Nirākār has now become a big cloud [Sākār]. It has taken a form. Those who came before were all a part and parcel of it. Now the whole has come. This cloud has rainwater. The rainwater is nourishing the minds of the people. Gradually they are brought to a level where their Kuṇḍalinīs have risen. They have got their Realization and now gradually they are feeling everything on their senses, their fingertips. This is the reason why nobody has talked about vibrations so clearly. They managed to talk about Chaitanya Laharī.<br>
This was so because of its avyakta [unmanifest] form. It was only a state. A state to be enjoyed, only in that state with no manifestation in the gross."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now, what Sahaja Yoga has done, that it has proved that it is the Will of God, it is the Desire of God, the Will of God, which is doing all the work.</b> And it has been proved. All these Chaitanya, Ādi Śhakti, is nothing but the Will of God. And Will of God is the One is working out everything very harmoniously.<br>
I don’t know if some of you must have read My book, first book [Book of Ādi Śhakti], where I have described how this Earth was created. There was a bang, but it was very harmonious, and how it developed is through the Will of God."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>The first thing that has happened is that your illusions have gone. You should have no illusions about God Almighty, His Will, and that He is omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient. All His omnipotence has done this work.</b><br>
And, as Collective Consciousness, you should also know that you are also omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient. Omniscient is the thing, that He sees everything, knows everything. Part of it, that Power, is also within you. So, to prove His omnipresence, you have to be all the time aware that you are Sahaja Yogis.<br>
..So the Omnipotent God who is everywhere, who has done all this, the Will of God that has worked it out, has to work through you people. And you have to be very strong, very sensible, very wise, also very effective people. The more effective you become the more energy you’ll get.<br>
But still, I feel that the Sahaja Yogis are more, not taking the <b>responsibility of understanding that they have to represent this God Almighty who is omnipresent, omniscient, who knows everything, who sees everything, and who is potent means Almighty</b>.<br>
If you understand that this is what has happened after opening the Sahasrāra, that you have now got the Power which has these three qualities in it."</font><br>
