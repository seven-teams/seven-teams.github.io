<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we have gathered here on the right occasion and very auspicious day to worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha.</b><br>
Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the first Deity that was created so that the whole Universe is filled with auspiciousness, with peace, bliss, and spirituality. He is the Source. He’s the Source of Spirituality. As a result of that, all other things follow. Like when it rains and is windy you feel a coolness in the atmosphere. In the same way when Śhrī Gaṇeśha emits His Power we feel all these three things within and without"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today you have called Me here, to worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha, within Me. Śhrī Gaṇeśha within Me is a powerful identity.</b><br>
While worshiping Him you have to know that such a powerful thing you have to establish within yourself and by that establishment you have to manifest the Powers of Śhrī Gaṇeśha and the Power of Śhrī Gaṇeśha’s greatness is auspiciousness. It’s a coefficience; it’s a formula, we can say in scientific language, that emits auspiciousness. It’s a magnet in the Mother Earth. The same magnet is within you, which is Śhrī Gaṇeśha."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now why first Śhrī Gaṇeśha? Because Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the beginning of the desire, and the end of the desire. You start with Gaṇeśha and you end up with Gaṇeśha. That’s why Śhrī Gaṇeśha is worshiped.</b> Is the other way around now, is the source.<br>
When you direct your attention to the source, you worship it, and when you want to incite or open out your own being, then you chant it. This is the difference between worship and a mantra. If you just say mantra, you open yourself out. But when you worship and chant, then you tap the source. I don’t know if I’ve said this before or not. That’s how you understand the Pūjā part."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So we have to first find out if the person is worthy of Pūjā or not. If the person is not worthy, it is better to leave the person alone till he becomes worthy of the Pūjā because doubts and all those things can obstruct the flow of vibrations to other people and such a person can create a problem for others. So it is not civil of that person also to be in the Pūjā if the person has not got an open heart and understanding of what Pūjā is. <b>Doing Pūjā to any Deity as such is not an easy thing, especially to Śhrī Gaṇeśha.</b> Those people who do Pūjā to Śhrī Gaṇeśha should know that of course it has to be a swayambhu means the one that is created by Mother Earth. No other than Gaṇeśha should be worshiped. And if they are not a realized Soul they can never worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha. They cannot even think of Him, they cannot even take His name, it is so difficult to reach Śhrī Gaṇeśha. <b>But after Realization, the first thing you have to do is to worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha because that’s the base on which you got your Realization.</b> He’s the One first who got His crucifixion then His Resurrection and it is the One who opened the path of Realization for you. So you have to worship Him before any other Deity with the greatest sacrifices."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>When you worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha keep your mind clean, keep your heart clean, keep your being clean</b> – no thoughts of lust and greed should come up. Actually, when the Kuṇḍalinī rises Gaṇeśha had to be awakened within us, the innocence has to come up – which obliterates all such degrading ideas within us. If ascent has to be achieved, we have to understand that we have to mature."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">" Now here I would like to say that it is Śhrī Gaṇeśha who is the Auṃkāra, who is the vibrations. So He is the Truth. What He says is the Truth. So what vibrations say is the truth. He’s Truth. So Auṃkāra is vibrations, that is Śhrī Gaṇeśh."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So today’s Pūjā is specially to be done with a prayer in your heart that: ‘Śhrī Gaṇeśha, please be kind and merciful and forgiving that You manifest within ourselves. Let all these hypocritical things, all these conditionings and all these wrong ideas we have or all the wrong life we have had, should just disappear like thin air, and let the beautiful moonlight of your soothing qualities of innocence be manifested through us.’<br>
Let us manifest these qualities. This is what is to be asked."</font><br>
