<font color="DarkRed">"It's a seminar that you have arranged, now I'm very happy. I always wanted you to arrange seminars and that you all should meet together, and live together, and understand each other. The seminars on the gross level they work out many things no doubt. But on subtler levels, seminars of the Sahaja Yogis means a lot. It uh means that a strong nucleus is being consolidated in various places in a country. And these strongholds, or we can say the strong nucleus which is created like this, can form a mechanism by which beams of strong vibrations could flow or could be thrown all over the places. It's a very great task to build up these mechanisms, these divine mechanisms in different parts of your country. "</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Then there are people who started, reflecting God in the musical notes and in the rhythm, of this universe. Then there are poets who started singing, the beauty of God, and His Greatness in their lyrics. That is how, the beauty is expressed, through the holy hands of holy people, all over the world. I don’t know nowadays if it is done so.<br>
Even in those days, at the time of Socrates, Lao Tze, philosophy was the dominating subject. People thought philosophy was the epitome of knowledge. But suddenly then it turned to economics and that’s the place we have, we lost our heritage of creativity, of the Divine Values, of the Divine Guṇas.<br>
On the music side same thing happened. <b>The music that was used to please the Gods and Goddesses, was used to please the kings and the queens.</b> And from them, it came to the masses, and when it came to the masses it became even a very cheap frivolous music. Same about dancing, same about all the arts that were created to reflect the beauty of God, the mirror of God. All that we got from all the 5 elements, was reduced to ashes by the value system that changed our ideas. <br>
......<br>
<b>The coefficient of beauty is auspiciousness. It has to give vibrations. If it does not give vibrations, it should not be accepted by you as something beautiful.</b> The mental projection about it that if it is so, then it is beautiful, if it is not, it’s not beautiful. Then they started branding things, that this is this style, that is the style, that is the style, and then you had to keep to their styles. And if you just try to avoid the styles, then you became a different person. And just to create a new styles, they just became like [unclear]. Without any concern to reality, or to the beauty, that is auspiciousness."</font><br>
