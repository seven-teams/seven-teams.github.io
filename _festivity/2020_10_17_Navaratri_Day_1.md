<font color="DarkRed">"<b>A Pūjā or a prayer grows from your heart. Mantras are the words of your Kuṇḍalinī. But if Pūjā is not performed from heart or if Kuṇḍalinī is not associated with recitation of Mantras then that Pūjā becomes a ritual.</b> If you become thoughtless in Pūjā, know that your heart is also involved in it. Collect the Pūjā material and offer it sincerely. There should be no formality or bindings in the offerings.<br>
It is correct to wash hands, but is your heart washed?<br>
When attention is on heart it does not go to others. Although you remain quiet from outside, you are speaking from within. Hence you should not, be silent for long time. If man’s heart is not clean, then the silence becomes very harmful. At the same time, loose talks can bring catastrophes.<br>
You should say the Mantras in Pūjā but with great faith (śhraddhā). There is no alternative to śhraddhā. You should perform the Pūjā when śhraddhā grows deep, so that heart itself gets all Pūjā performed. At that time waves of bliss start flowing because it is the Spirit that is saying, how can any thought come at that time?"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"There are many miraculous things in the Realm of the Divine and in Pūjās. When we do a Pūjā we must first praise Śhrī Gaṇeśha so that Śhrī Gaṇeśha will be awakened and established within you. <b>By worshiping Me as Śhrī Gaṇeśha your Innocence will be established, and you will see the vibrations rise and increase so that you will feel very stable within yourself.</b> When you take Śhrī Gaṇeśha’s names you will know the qualities that He has and what powers He gives to you. When you praise these qualities, then the powers of these qualities will start emitting through you. This is how the Divine works. If you are changed by these qualities then you praise the Goddess – the Ādi Śhakti. "</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Today on the first day of Navarātri your attention should be on Shrī Gaṇesha. His devotion is infinite.</b><br>
He has never worshipped anybody else except Mother. Hence, He is so great. All other Gods appear very strong. Everyone has some specialty. What is Mother’s specialty? Her ego (aham) is nowhere felt by others. Hence Shrī Gaṇesha who has surrendered to such Mother, is so wise and venerable, Mother has nothing with Her. Her very name begins with ‘Ni’ e.g. ‘Nishakanchan’ having no wealth, ‘Nirlepa’ unaffected; Nirvichara’ thoughtless; ‘Nishprayojana’ having no motives, ‘Nigarvita’ egoless, ‘Niricchā’ desireless etc.<br>
Therefore, surrendering to such Mother, who has nothing with Her, needs some kind of subtle thought, in that, Mother has nothing with Her and therefore, nothing can be asked from Her. It shows how Shrī Gaṇesha by himself, is fully satisfied. Where does this contentment of Shrī Gaṇesha come from? It is own power. When the gate of the Self opens, nothing else is required. It is the Mother who opens this gate and therefore, She is so dear to Shrī Gaṇesha. Complete Self-realization is that stage attaining which nothing else is required. Thereafter, only enjoying the bliss and the satisfaction of fulfillment.<br>
<b>You are made in the pattern of Shrī Gaṇesha. Therefore, your power is unmatched, but for that, you should have devotion and innocence like Shrī Gaṇesha’s. Then Mother would admire you and the whole world would witness that beautiful sight.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkSlateBlue"><b>O Daughter of the King of the mountains!<br>
The sages say that the world has its dissolutions and Genesis<br>
With the closing and opening of Thine Eyes,<br>
Thine Eyes are bereft of winking,<br>
With a view to save from dissolution this entire universe,<br>  
Which has its origin in the opening of Thine Eyes.</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>On this day Devī is worshiped as Śhailaputrī, means the daughter of Himalaya. Devī has many other names also but first of all She incarnated as Śhailaputrī in the cold of Himalayas. She incarnated and whatever She was to do. She started there.</b> Further story is known to you. [King] Dakṣha did not invite Lord Śhiva in the Havana that he performed and Śhailaputrī was the consort of Lord Śhiva. She is called Satī because She entered the Holy fire of Havana and ablated Herself. But by then Lord Śhiva reached there. He lifted her burnt up body from the fire. Burnt pieces of the body of Śhailaputrī fell at many places. All these places are considered to be Śhakti Pīṭhas, the places of worship, as there is in Vindhyāchala and many other places. Her power moves there and it is said that it Sanctifies everything. Her seventh power is considered to be the Power of Destruction. Śhakti manifested Itself on the right side as Sāvitrī and Gāyatrī but the destroying force was manifested in the center. <b>In the form of Durgā and Her other forms manifested in Heart chakra. She is present there. If someone hurts you, confuses or disturbs you then this power will protect you and destroy your enemy.</b>"</font><br>

So She has put this ghata in which She is staying as Kuṇḍalinī now. So the first is that to establish the Kuṇḍalinī in the triangular bone, and then to establish Shrī Gaṇesha.<br>
