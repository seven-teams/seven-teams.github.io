<font color="DarkRed">"I want to tell you that, now that you have come for the Pūjā, it should be of some use to you, that all Deities within you should be awakened and that today’s Pūjā is for awakening those Deities. So, you should learn how these people awaken different Deities. When you grow up a little we will teach you the mantras with which you also will be able to help others with the Self-realization. Then you will know where and what they are catching, what are their problems, and how to cleanse them. When you master that knowledge you will also become Yogis.<br>
You also can awaken the Kuṇḍalinīs by just moving your hands and, you will see, those persons will also feel cool on their heads. Even now you try on anyone and you will feel that the Kuṇḍalinī is flowing from your hands. With a little upward movement of your hands, you will feel cool on the head, do it thrice and you will feel cool on your heads.<br>
For that, you will have to worship every day."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Now, today is a special day I thought of having a Pūjā, because today is the Moon – just see, in front of Me here – and today is the first day the Moon is waxing [waning]. In the science of Sahaja Yoga, the Moon is the Spirit in our heart. It is the Spirit in our heart, meaning in Marathi pūrṇāntara. It’s the Spirit in our heart, and it shines when the Sun reflects on it. When the Sun – the Sun, that is the Sun of God. When the Sun of God reflects on the heart, then the Moon shines in the human heart. But when it shines as a Moon, then Śhiva Himself lifts it up and puts it on His head. So the human beings who are blessed by the Sun of God, who are being awakened by the Sun of God, that is you can say that it is Śhrī Gaṇeśh or Lord Jesus Christ, any one of them, if they enlighten the heart of human beings, then it becomes a shining Moon.<br>

<font size="+0">Dear brothers and sisters,<br>
Jai Śhrī Mātājī!<br>
Today is Śhārad Pūrṇimā or Kojāgirī Pūrṇimā.  This is a harvest festival celebrated on the Full Moon Day of the Hindu lunar month of Āśhvin (September–October). It marks the end of the monsoon. There is a traditional celebration of the moon.</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size="+0"><b>"In 82, 83 or 84 we celebrated Kojāgirī Pūrṇimā with Śhrī Mātājī at Hall in Saneguruji Vidyalay, Dadar, Mumbai where weekly Saturday meeting took place. She prepared milk also for all of us.
She mentions in that talk "Goddess comes to everybody's house late at night on that day She ask "Kojagarti" in Sanskrit mean who has not awakened yet."<br>
The recollection of a Sahaja Yoginī from Mumbai, India.</b></font>
</p>

<p>
<font size="+0"><b>The Significance of this festivity:</b></font><br>
On this auspicious day of Śhārad Pūrṇimā or Kojāgirī, moonlights are filled with Amrut which clears negativities and all the diseases.<br>
On this day it is believed that Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī comes on the earth and goes about from place to place asking, "Who is awake?" ("Kojagarti") and She showers Her blessings on those She finds awake.<br>
Hence, the night is spent in festivity, singing, and praising in honor of the Goddess. So people sit in the moonlight singing bhajans in praise of the Devī. Thus this Kojāgirī night in India is celebrated customarily by observing a night vigil and other rituals.<br>
All the Sahaja yogis on this night collectively sing bhajans/praises to Śhrī Mātājī enlightening our powers within.<br>
Popularly on this day milk is boiled along with rice and made into  ‘kheer’ – and dry fruits are added to make it delicious that is offered to the Devī and consumed.<br>
<br>
Tonight is a very auspicious Full Moon when we can absorb the cooling rays of the Moon to cool down our right side and absorb the blessings.<br>
On this day we could thank Śhrī Mātājī for giving us Self-realization and sing a few bhajans to celebrate.
