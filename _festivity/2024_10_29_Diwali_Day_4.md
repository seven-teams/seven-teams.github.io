<font color="DarkRed">"So, this is what it is. <b>One has to know that Mahālakṣhmī Tattwa is represented here as the light.</b> And, you see these lights when enlightened, even a small light, how it reacts and how it shows. And now, you have become the light, you see. Even this light can do it. You see, I put My hand to it and it recognizes and knows that because it is now enlightened. It is put before the Photograph, it's enlightened. It works that way.<br>
Now what about you? <b>You are the light now; you are the Diwālī of God.</b><br>
<b>Diwālī means the, the rows of lights. So, you are going to make this beautiful mansion of God full of Diwālī light. You have entered into the Kingdom of God and you have to enlighten it. So you are the decoration of God on one side, you are the glory of God</b> and also, on the other side you are the guide, guidelines -- you are like the torches ...... You have to become lighthouses."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"...... <b>is the day of Mahālakṣhmī Pūjā nights, not only of Lakṣhmī Pūjā</b>. There's a difference between the two.<br>
Mahālakṣhmī is one of the powers of the Three Powers, Main Powers, of Ādi Śhakti. As you know Mahālakṣhmī, Mahāsaraswatī, Mahākālī.<br>
Now these powers have powers at a material level also, at a subtler level also. So Mahālakṣhmī Power is achieved after Lakṣhmī Power."</font><br>

<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>"So, for today's New Year, let us vow within ourselves, that the selfishness or the self-centeredness or the smallness in you is finished."</b></font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Now, why is it necessary to have a New Year Day in our life?<br>
While last year those who got Realization were very lucky people, but plodding through the path of Self-realization one loses all the enthusiasm and idealism that one has when you get Realization.<br>
You think of doing so many things about it. When you get Realization you are so much engrossed into it, you enjoy it so much that you think that, 'Now! The time has come for me to do this and that and that, and I'm going to contact these people and I'm going to give this to news to this one, and I'm going to do this work and show to Mother that what She has given me, I have made it many folds.' Because it was a new experience, great experience, the only experience that you have been waiting for.<br>
And that you also decide that, 'I am going to now become the torchbearer of this great light that has come into me, and I am going to form one of the lights of this Dīpawali.' "</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Then the day of the New Year comes in afterwards, because in India in the north, that's the time people finish their crops and they found that day was very good to celebrate the New Year. And, that is actually more, sort of, we can say is a social thing in India, we need not use that, what ever suits us. You can have your own New Year. Because in the south, say in Maharashtra they have another New Year, as I told you where Śhālivāhana in his dynasty started another calendar and they celebrate that.<br>
So all these things are nothing is rigid about anything, one must know. Nothing is rigid. Rigidity comes from ignorance.<br>
It's all for you, for your joy and happiness. The whole festival system is for your happiness and not for the happiness of the time or date. It's for you, so it should be adjustable according to your needs and understanding. And also according to your national way you live. They should be no addiction to any particular type of culture, a particular type of ideas. It's all for you. All these festivals are for you, not for Gods. They don't have these festivals. It's only for you people these festivals are there. And when you celebrate them, that's only for your joy and your happiness. And that's how you should celebrate in a way that gives you the greatest amount of happiness. And the festivals, all the festivals of the world must be celebrated. The more you are festive, the happier it is."</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"...... [in] Sahaja Yoga we believe that the Lakṣhmī must became [become] Mahālakṣhmī. A man has to become greater man: mahā mānav. What does that mean? That She has to become the Mahālakṣhmī.<br>
<b>Mahālakṣhmī is a Deity which makes you absolutely satisfied with whatever you have. Complete satisfaction.</b></font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So, She gives all kinds of benevolence and as a result, the Mahālakṣhmī Principle gets awakened in you. This Mahālakṣhmī Principle is nothing but the desire to be one with God.</b><br>
When you get the Mahālakṣhmī Principle you feel, "Mātājī, we have got everything and we have understood that God is with us and that we have come into the Kingdom of God but yet we feel that something is missing." What is missing? "We have not yet given anything to someone, we have not shared and eaten, we feel that we have eaten alone." At that point, the Mahālakṣhmī Principle gets awakened in you and when it gets awakened, if you slowly make your flame taller with balance, not with imbalance, but with balance, then She will sit in your Brahmarandhra and your whole life will get enlightened."</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"...... the <b>Mahālakṣhmī Principle is the principle where you start seeking the Truth and nothing else.</b><br>
But how can you seek the Truth without any light in your hand? It's not some sort of an abstract thing or just a drama. 'Oh, I'm seeking the truth with my eyes closed and with darkness in my hand, I'm seeking the truth!' How can you take to Mahālakṣhmī Principle unless and until the Lakṣhmī Principle is embedded in you? Unless and until you feel that love for each other, you have felt that love, you have expressed that love, you have been generous, you have been enjoying the generosity of your own. Then only you can rise up to that Principle of Mahālakṣhmī which is the Spiritual Principle."</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now I have to take you to a very subtler side of life and that subtler side is that with the blessings of Śhrī Lakṣhmī or Mahālakṣhmī now you have achieved your Self-realization. The Mahālakṣhmī Principle has given you this ascent and the Mahālakṣhmī Principle is that you rise much above your mundane life into the Realm of Self-realization.<br>
So by Her blessings you become like lotuses yourselves.</b> Now you become another aspect of Diwālī which means the rows of lights.<br>
Śhrī Rāma's crowning or any other aspect of Śhrī Lakṣhmī here now becomes your own crowning, that is now you have entered into the Kingdom of God and once you are there then automatically as the citizens of God's Kingdom you are blessed and as you become the lotuses then you start spreading your fragrance all around. Now you do not keep this joy to yourself but you become generous about it and you go all out to give it to others."</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So out of the Lakṣhmī Principle I hope you get all the tattwas, all the principles, satisfied in you fully, and also the Mahālakṣhmī Principle flows through your being.<br>
You have to be very satisfied and comfortable people. Not to find faults. If you are finding faults then know that you are not Sahaja Yogis. If you are trying to control others then know that you are not Sahaja Yogis.<br>
Even the leaders, I would say, should never try to control. They must know how the principle is working in the silence; see for themselves how it is working. It's a trick you must learn. Of course, little correction is needed. That time you correct the person. At that time, doesn't matter. But you must know how the whole principle of benevolence is working itself. The whole Paramachaitanya is doing the benevolence part; you must know that.<br>
As I've told you before also, you have to be like the sea which receives all the rivers into it. If you are on top of the hill you cannot receive anything. So you have to be like a sea to receive everything and you have to be at the height. As I told you the other day, the same way that very close to the sea there should be a personality which is above everything else. Such a beautiful personality you should have, is the depth of the sea and the height of the Kailāsa."</font><br>
