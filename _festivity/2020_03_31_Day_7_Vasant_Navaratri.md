<font color="DarkRed">"<b>This Kuṇḍalinī is your mother, your individual mother. She knows everything about Me.</b> She has everything recorded in Her inner coils just like a tape recorder, you can say. She knows everything and She is very anxious to give you your Realization. She is the reflection of the Primordial Mother, the Holy Ghost, and She’s just waiting for this time.<br>
So you leave it, the judgment to Her, you don’t judge yourself. This is very important because if by this chakra, this chakra gets blocked, the Kuṇḍalinī won’t rise."</font><br>

<font color="Maroon"><b>"When your Kuṇḍalinī [is] raised and you get Self-realization, your Kuṇḍalinī crosses the Āgñyā chakra.<br>
When this happens you become thoughtless.<br>
Nirvichār Samādhi, but Samādhi does not mean being unconscious, going into trance.<br>
Then you are totally conscious. You are thoughtless and totally aware, alert.<br>
You know everything around you but there are no thought waves from your ego or superego.<br> 
You are in peace and joy. In such a state this Kuṇḍalinī energy flows from you."</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Above this chakra is the Āgñyā chakra, which is a very, very important chakra, which is the door, which is the door of the Sahasrāra. At the Āgñyā chakra resides Mahāviṣhṇu. Those who have read about Mahāviṣhṇu in the Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa or in the Devī Bhāgavat[am] you will know what I am talking about but you will not know when He incarnated and who He was. He was nobody else but Jesus Christ.<br>
Jesus Christ was the only Son of Mary who was Rādhā. She was Mahālakṣhmī. It was Mahālakṣhmī who incarnated as Mary and Jesus Christ was nobody else but Mahāviṣhṇu. If you want to know about Mahāviṣhṇu you must read Devī Bhāgavat[am]. There it’s described in all elaboration. But whether He is there or not, whether it’s a fact or not can be seen because [if] somebody’s Āgñyā chakra is caught up we have to take the name of Jesus Christ. <b>He is Auṃkār Swarūp so you can even take the name of Auṃkāra but you have to take the name of Jesus Christ. If you do not take His name, if you do not accept Him I cannot open your Āgñyā chakra.</b><br>
...... In the Āgñyā chakra He resides. He controls your ego and superego, both. He removes the entities that are in you and He kills your darpa, your ego. He looks after your ego."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"And when it is said that you have to get your Realization through Christ, it means that He had to pierce through the Āgñyā chakra. He had to be there. <b>If He had not created this gap in the Gate, we could never have got Realization. That is why it is said that: “You are to pass through the Gates of Heaven only with the Grace of Christ.”</b> Of course, that doesn’t mean churches, it doesn’t mean at all churches. That you understand as Sahaja Yogi: that you have to pass through the Āgñyā chakra. Ultimately, that’s the most difficult point where human beings had to pass. Because at the Āgñyā chakra your ego and superego are fully grown. At the human stage only this ego is developed. Now, how to overcome the ego was a point. And to overcome the ego Christ had to do this."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"One is below the Kuṇḍalinī and there are six above it. Out of them, the one that is here, is the center between the optic chiasma, where the two optic nerves meet.<br>
And that’s the point they call the ‘third eye’ and that’s a very important point, and this is the point of Christ. 
<b>This is the point where you see this red mark [bindi] is the point of Christ and when the Kuṇḍalinī rises She awakens all these Deities.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So, they are talking about the Collective Subconscious area, which lies beyond the subconscious. So, this Collective Subconscious is the one, which contains all that is the past, all that is there. Now there are many vegetables, which went out of circulation of evolution. These when they enter into our being exist within us because everything that is past and future exists within us. So, once they enter into our body, we get these virus infections. Virus comes from these things, which are of the past and they enter into us and pull us towards the Collective Subconscious and that’s how we get the symptoms of virus and you know that virus cannot be treated. It has to be allowed to pass out. So they just enter into our being and pass out.<br>
......<br>
Now, when you start moving too much towards the left, due to the activity of the left side, means a person who is very emotional or who bows to wrong type of people.<br>
That’s why it is said don’t bow your head to wrong type of people. If you bow too much to people out of slavery and all that, all these people start getting conditioned and all that and <b>superego develops and they go to the Collective Subconscious area where they are, they get caught up by these proteins which we call in our ordinary language, as bhūt. We call them bhūta piśhāchāri [ghost vampire]</b>."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"Collectively conscious means that you immediately you can start feeling others on the fingers, you start feeling the different centers that are there. Now, all these I can decode and you can find out for yourself."</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>In Sahaja Yoga, how do you avoid all this, that you take out your attentions from the Collective Subconscious, from the past subconscious, from the present subconscious, from the today subconscious, into the center. But for that, one has to be determined person. His willpower must be strong.</b> But all left-sided people have a very, very poor willpower. You do what you like, but they’ll go back to their habits. You try your level best. Slowly, slyly you see. All these things they do not understand, they’ll tell it to the camp of their enemies. As a matter of fact, they’ll go into such problems there, that they will suffer and suffer and suffer.<br>
So now, the theory comes out of human intelligence, that we must suffer. But there are no solutions. So theories like this: that we must suffer and suffering is godly."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"While giving bandhan one must have this thought that, <b>‘O Lord, let us remain in your bandhan and nothing untoward may happen to us.’</b> Bow down with extreme humility. At that time, just assume that you are in Witness State and detached from everything. Just make yourself detached from everything and meditate.<br>
If you try this daily, it will become a habit.<br>
With extreme śhraddhā one must meditate early in the morning, may be for ten minutes or half an hour, it does not matter.<br>
<b>While meditating do not move your hands.<br>
Just watch the Photograph and slowly close your eyes while meditating and do not move your hands. At that time whichever chakra is having imbalance, it can be corrected by just watching that chakra because as I have said, Divine Vibrations are more in the morning."</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"And that’s what you have to do, is to use the candle. Is the candle and they will tell you how to do it. And it will be all right, because what is it, you see, there’s a left side virus you have got. <b>Virus, infection. And for the virus you have to use the light.</b> Light. Light is more than the heat. Is not the heat, is the light, that will help you a lot.<br>
...It’s a, just a virus infection of a ... what you call the allergic, allergic conditions, are nothing but viruses. Allergic. <b>And these viruses are the, the plants and things that have gone out of the circulation of evolution. So they live on the left side, in the Collective Subconscious, you see, the area which was built in. And they attack you.</b> Once they attack you, then medical cannot cure it, you see. It’s a psycho, psychosomatic trouble. And now in his case, also same thing. <b>Only the candle can cure it. The candle, they will tell you how to use. You have to use My Photograph.</b> All right? You’ll be all right. It’s nothing special.<br>
...... And doctors also know, that they cannot cure virus trouble, they know that, isn’t it? Virus is incurable, they know it very well. Do you know, that cancer and all the psychosomatic troubles come from viruses. They are all viruses, different types, that’s all. And if you can just get your attention away from them, you are all right. <b>Sahaja Yoga is that. If you move towards the left, you go to the Collective Subconscious. There are all those things, which have gone out of the circulation of evolution, are there. But if you can some or other pull out your attention, you get cured. Same on the right side also you can have problems. But for psychosomatic troubles only this candle treatment helps a lot. It’s a wonderful thing.</b>"</font><br>
