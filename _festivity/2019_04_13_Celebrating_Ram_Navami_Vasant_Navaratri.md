<font color="DarkRed">"On the night of Full Moon, you should meditate on Śhrī Rāma and surrender yourself to Him for protection. The meaning of the word rāmachandra is ‘creativity’. You should completely dedicate your creative powers to Him. Thus you have to take special care of yourself on these two days. However <b>on the seventh (Saptamī) and ninth (Navamī) days of Lunar fortnights you have My special blessings.</b> Remember that you are specially blessed by Me on these two days. Make some special arrangements so that you can have proper meditation on these days."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Śhrī Rāma Himself was born on the right side.<br>
Great example for all of you is Śhrī Rām who was on the right side, who works the right side. When He was born and He was a child ... <b>He is a Sūryavaṃśhi, He is the son of Sūrya. I mean Sūrya – everything comes from the Sun to Him.</b> When He was born and was a little child, He asked His mother that “I would like to have the Moon.” He started crying, and nobody knew how to satisfy. He said “I want to have the Moon.” They gave him any toys – he’d throw away. They said, “What a child it is, funny thing ... He wants to have the Moon, now how to get Him the moon?” They did not know how to solve the problem.<br>
He said, "Somehow you get Me the Moon. I don’t want to eat or anything, I want to have the Moon."<br>
Here the Moon represents the Ātmā, the cooling capacity. He asked for the Moon. You are all on the right side, so ask for the Moon. Ask for the Spirit. And they didn’t know how to satisfy this Śhrī Rāma, who was the Incarnation of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, asking for the Moon of all the things, not for anything else. What is so important? So, the mother has always a[n] intuition. She brought a ... it’s a, it’s a Rāmāyaṇa, it is a beautiful drama. She brought a mirror and showed Him the Moon in the mirror. He said, “Now you can get the Moon here.” So sweet! And He was satisfied. Even the reflection of that can satisfy. You are like the mirrors and I want to see the reflection of Moon in you."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Rāma was studying with this Vasiṣhṭha and they used to come for holidays to father’s place.<br>
Then, he had the capacity to kill a demon with only one arrow.<br>
It’s called as Ekabāṇi."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Śhrī Rāma came on this Earth to establish the institution of benevolent king. The political development and the political evolution started from this [right] side. He is the one who gave leadership as a benevolent king, the one who represents God and who is a king. The idea of a king related to God came from Śhrī Rāma. But the modern kings are not like that, they have no relation with God.<br>
On the contrary, they are horrid people. Some of them are nothing but satanic people, absolutely Satan is there and you can see from the way they lead their lives, and they have led their life before. So the benevolence of Śhrī Rāma is here [shows the right Heart] to be followed by all the political leaders and all the people who are at the helm of affairs. He is the ideal that was created for human beings, to run their authority as the head, or the loving compassionate benevolent leader of the people, who has to govern them by making them respectful, by respect. And if human beings create such things who are not respectable, those who have no human values, those who have no moral courage, those who are selfish, those who are self-centered, then they have nothing to do to be there.<br>
So this is the position of Rāma who is the Father. So the head of every state has to be the father of his subjects, that’s what He has tried to show by His life. So much so that He had to sacrifice His beloved Wife, whom He loved so much."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"That is a very beautiful song was written by him. But still, the description of a child, how when he runs when he runs,when he jumps, when he walks it’s a beautiful songs about Śhrī Rāma. Ṭhumko atta hai who – Ṭhumaka chalat Rām[a]chandra, atta hai kya?<br>
[In Hindi:] <b>Do you know the song 'Ṭhumaka chalat  Rām[a]chandra'</b> ...<br>
[In English:] Now these words are such that we cannot explain in English, but when they walk, you know, with – started walking, so their body, you know, moves in a way that’s called ‘ṭhumakanā’ [ toddle, waddle] in Hindi language. <b>So described by Tulasīdāsa, as Śhrī Rāma is walking in that way. ‘Ṭhumaka chalat Rām[a]chandra’. And His anklets are singing and then He’s looking round and every pebble on which He’s walking is reflecting Him, like the souls in which He’s reflected.</b>"</font><br>
