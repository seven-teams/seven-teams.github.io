<font color="DarkRed">"Today’s day there are many people in the whole world who are meditating. I am thinking of all those people. You have to also think [of] all of them and know that they are part and parcel of My Being as you all are. And you are the alert ones. So, at this time in this Pūjā, you are not only doing Pūjā for yourself, for London people, but for the whole world. Not only for Sahaja Yogis who are all over, of course for them also, but in this Pūjā you are expressing yourself as Sahaja Yogis who have recognized Me, and are requesting to bless the rest of the people so that they also recognize Me as you have recognized. By this Pūjā I hope recognition will be much more clearer. <b>By My recognition only you will recognize your Self and the whole thing will work out in a very, very beautiful manner.</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>What is Your prowess to be compared to?<br> 
Where can one find this beauty (of Yours) most charming, (yet) striking fear in enemies?<br> 
Compassion in heart and relentlessness in battle are seen, 
O Devī, <br> 
O Bestower of boons, only in You in all the three worlds!</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"She came on this Earth many a times, to kill the people who were doing wrong things, who were trying to kill good people. She has done Her level [best] to do that, and today we are celebrating Her birthday.<br>
You all know so much about it, that I need not tell you, but what you have to know is that She came on this Earth to save you from all kinds of troubles. <b>For Her you were important, very important, because you were doing Devī Pūjā and so we are celebrating today this Devī Pūjā, with all our heart, because whatever ill people did to you, She came to destroy them. So today is a very great day for you to thank Her; thank Her for Her protection and for Her understanding as to what you have been tortured for.</b><br>
I’m happy you are all here to celebrate Her birthday, and to be surrendered to Her so that She can always, always protect you, and give you Her blessings.<br>
So may God bless you all, your children, your families, and that you bring great joy and protection."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So you have already heard about the importance of today in the life of the Goddess. And that today Rāvaṇa was killed and that’s how there were celebrations.</b> As you know very well that all the satanic forces which one had to face one at the time are all back on the stage and they are to be defeated. The greatest problem of modern times is that these satanic forces have taken a very subtle form and they enter into your psyches and into your egos. And you are the Saints, you are the bhaktas, you are the devotees of the Goddess. It’s a very delicate situation. When the confusion is there, when the Saints are attacked, the aggressor can be removed, but the Saint becomes mixed up or confused with negative forces, which is very difficult to make him see the light. And you have seen this situation very well. And the subtler you grow, the subtler they became. And they start giving you ideas which are so negative, but you cannot see them.<br>
So the problem today is very delicate. There are no absolute Saints and there are no absolute bad people."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today especially it’s a very great day of Dussehra we call it. This is the day when, as you know, Rāvaṇa was burned.</b> Effigies of Rāvaṇa are burnt all over the place. When Śhrī Rāma came this was done. His victory. But in His victory, it was not that He made Sahaja Yogis or He gave Realization – No! His victory was that He killed Rāvaṇa. That was done that time for today’s preparation, for today’s happenings. It was done long time back that these days will come when people will have a proper value system of the victory of Śhrī Rāma. But it doesn’t happen, it doesn’t happen, because this Incarnation of Mātājī Nirmalā Devī is very different, is very illusive – Mahāmāyā."</font><br>

Laghima is to become small, Mahima is to have a big form, Īśhatva is to create Gods out of human beings, Vaśhitva is the attraction, Prākāmya is the manifestation, Bhukti is the enjoyment, [Icchā] fulfillment of desire.

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Falsehood is growing faster. Fanaticism is in the action and people are wasting their lives by going here and there.</b><br>
You don’t know God has created you with compassion. You have crossed many generations to reach this stage of human beings.<br>
You should gain something from this freedom who are we? How much labor has He made to make us, in compassion, by giving nourishment, beauty.<br> 
Human personality has reached to a stage. You must think over it. You should know who are you?<br>
