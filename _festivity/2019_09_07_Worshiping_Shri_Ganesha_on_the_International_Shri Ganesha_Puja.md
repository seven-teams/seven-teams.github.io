<font color="DarkRed">"Today we have gathered here on the right occasion and very auspicious day to worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha. Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the first Deity that was created so that the whole Universe is filled with auspiciousness, with peace, bliss, and spirituality. He is the Source. He’s the Source of Spirituality. As a result of that all other things follow. Like when it rains and is windy you feel a coolness in the atmosphere. In the same way when Śhrī Gaṇeśha emits His Power we feel all these three things within and without. But it has been so unfortunate, specially in the West, that the most important fundamental Deity has been completely not only neglected, but insulted and crucified."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"With all the Gaṇapatis sitting around Me and you all the gaṇas sitting in front of Me, I don’t know what to say. It’s remarkable, very remarkable because most of you come from a culture, which has never shown any respect of Śhrī Gaṇeśh. They never realized how important it was that, without Śhrī Gaṇeśha’s qualities, we cannot achieve anything in our life.<br>
The idea of everyday, moment-to-moment enjoyment has destroyed them. And also the desire to know the Divine vanishes also in thin air because you get lost into this moment-to-moment enjoyment till you get destructive, completely destroyed. But I really don’t understand how you have achieved this state where you see the purity is so important to life that Gaṇeśha’s qualities, His value system and His innocence to be imbibed."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"To manifest Śhrī Gaṇeśha, we have to do certain amount of tapasyā, penance. First we have to say, when we sit for meditation, that, ‘I am going to be worthy of Your appreciation. Make me humble, so that I am appreciated by You, and my only desire is to please You.’ Then you sit down in complete preparedness, meditating over your Mūlādhāra, putting your attention to it with Absolute Purity. Now you have My Photograph before you and you tell the Photograph, ‘Mother, You are Śhrī Gaṇeśha. You give me wisdom and discretion.’ So, attention at the Mūlādhāra chakra, which is actually below the sacrum bone. You put your right hand towards the Photograph, and left hand on the Mother Earth. Now this will tell you that your mind, or your brain which is full of confusion, which has no discretion, which is complicated, which does the same mistakes again and again, which does not understand how to cure the ills of bad feelings, all that can be cured if you put your right hand towards Me and the left hand to the Mother Earth. So, in action you do like that."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Now, many people should try this thing: sitting in a group together, meditating, saying the mantra of Śhrī Gaṇeśha, to try to build up. Those who think too much, they should also try to say 'Not this, not this, not this ...' Even the superego when it gives you thoughts, you should say 'not this, not this, not this ...' So you will develop that state where you stand yourself: and nothing else. So the innocence plays, but it is not involved. It sees the play. Just sees. It enjoys the play. Just enjoys. So today when we are thinking of Śhrī Gaṇeśha, let us desire that, 'Within us His Great Power of Innocence be enlightened.'<br>
And He is, on the other side, the Source of Love. The Source of Emotional Security. He's like a child, a very charming, beautiful child, and people feel extremely enchanted."</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="Maroon">"But Gaṇeśha's enchantment has dignity.<br> 
He may look like a child, but He is an old man.<br>
He is the eldest of all. And despite all these years, he has kept His innocence intact."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"...... the Power of Gaṇeśha can only be manifested if you are wise. Because He is the giver of wisdom. Now people don’t understand what is wisdom is, this is the big problem.<br>
Intelligence, so-called, is not wisdom. It can make you a very cunning, very aggressive, and sometimes very subtle person, who can go on deceiving people, telling lies, doing all kinds of things, and believing in themselves that they are very, very successful.<br>
<b>Success is never the criteria of a Sahaja Yogi. Success in Sahaja Yoga means very subtle surrendering of oneself to Sahaja Yoga. That is seldom to be found unless and until you meditate every day. Is very important that you must meditate.</b>"</font><br>
