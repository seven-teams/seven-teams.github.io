<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now, when we are celebrating the greatest of greatest this Navarātri, there must be something special about it, that we have to cleanse this heart completely,</b> fully and make it so pure that it purifies all the blood that passes through the whole of the body. So the cells of this heart, which has made this great organ, has to be the best, because the cells of the heart within a human body are the best cells, the highest quality, the most sensitive. And it's the heart that expresses the Anāhata, the sound that is without percussion. While we find that there are some people of caliber, there are, but others talk more, show off more, and do not have the caliber. "</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"But <b>the Greatest Power that is belonging to the Mother is your protection</b>. Protection from all kinds of things -- all the left-hand side protections are there. They are described, as you must have learnt on the Devī Māhātmyam -- what a protections She gives you. So tremendous in Her protecting power. And this protecting power gives you understanding -- how kind She is and how, I should say, how very-very protective, extremely protective. She'll guide you all the time that you should be protected -- on the left side. And through Her gaṇas She looks after you.<br>
But on the right side also, those who are on the right side, the Goddess puts Her Powers to put you right, to bring you back to normal conditions, to humble you down and make you understand that you are a child of the Mother and you have to behave like a child.<br>
......<br>
<b>So the protection is also built in your body. By gaṇas on the left-hand side and by reactions on the right-hand side.</b> But the greatest thing is the blessings of the Mother. The way She looks after you, the way She loves you and the way She cares for you -- which you should never take it for granted."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So many powers Mother has to have to protect Her children and to look after them. These powers are all there, working relentlessly all the time, twenty-four hours. So anybody who surrenders to Mother, these powers express themselves and try to help you out of your problems. But first thing is surrendering. If you are not surrendered, if you are not in the Kingdom of the God, then this is not the responsibility of the Mother. Then it might be that some negative force might take over and may destroy you."</font><br>

[After Sahaja Yogis suggest, "Protection":] That's rather, protection is abstract, but this is a protection of the Mother is a concrete stuff, you see, kavach. So you take the kavach. Kavach is something you can say that people wear those armor, inside, you see that sort of a thing, is kavach. So you must take that before going out or talking to somebody. That you don't do."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>First and foremost thing She does is to protect us. Wherever you may be, whatever you may be doing, in whatever peril you may be, howsoever dangerously you may be placed in life, She protects you. First thing, She protects you.</b><br>
......<br>
So, when you worship Her, what do you want? You want Her to protect you. In your discrimination, in your mistake, you might do something wrong. May do something that is not good for you, could be very dangerous for you. But She is the person who guides how to avoid all the dangers. Now, She protects your life, She protects your body, She protects all organs of your body, She is the One who gives you all the security of life.<br>
In Her Realm, you feel completely secure. You are never afraid of anything. Because you have left Her Realm, you have come out of it, that is why -- that is the reason you are afraid. But if you are under Her beautiful guidance and Her blessings, you will never feel afraid to do anything. You will never do anything wrong also. As soon as you'll try to do wrong, She will hold your hand. She is really the guiding person.<br>
<b>She is the One who actually gives us our existence. Without Her, we cannot exist, because She is the One who is the Power of Śhrī Śhiva.</b>"</font><br>
