<font color="DarkRed">"<b>These people have decided today to have a Pūjā, and you know what happens to Me when you do My Pūjā.</b> So with all those problems that will be facing later, I would like all of you to be attentive about the Pūjā and to take full advantage of that. <b>With this Pūjā you get the Mother’s protection, to begin with.</b> And My chakras, when they start moving, they give you special powers of love and bless all your chakras and fill them up completely. So I would like you, though some two people are coming to do this, all of you to feel that you all are doing it, and you can feel it that way with oneness. And the blessings of My being will flow to you automatically."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Pray, get the strength and act. Otherwise, you will end up with prayer only. You get the strength and do it. Try to give away things. This you should decide because Navarātri is coming now. It’s a very big day and Sahaja Yogis have to be prepared for that day. It’s a very big privilege for you people that Navarātri is coming and there is going to be a Pūjā of Navarātri. But one thing is compulsory that you all should improve yourself and try to be there where a son of the Mother is sitting. Be mild. Be sweet. Create an atmosphere of congeniality. There should be congenial feeling, loving care for each other."</font><br>

Dear Brothers and Sisters,<br>
Jai Śhrī Mātājī!<br>
There is no greater joy but to celebrate and offer thanksgivings to the Supreme Goddess who through many Incarnations had saved us from negative forces and ultimately gave our Second Birth, the Self-realization, in this lifetime. Whenever Śhrī Mātājī incarnated in full human form we failed to recognize Her. It is a unique chance for all of us to, now, once forever, recognize Her fully from each and every part of our souls. And no better chance to express our profound recognition could be there than the nine Navarātri days and nights of October 17 to October 25.<br> 
Let's all get together to surrender at the Lotus Feet of Śhrī Mātājī so that our worship of Her, pleases Her and we are worthy of Her protection and take full advantage of Her infinite blessings.<br>
</p>

<p>
We will be first worshipping Śhrī Mātājī in Her Nine Forms of Śhrī Durgā as described by Śhrī Brahmadeva Himself in the Kavach of Devī as below:<br>
</p>	

<p>
"<font color="DarkGreen"><b>Brahmadeva said;</b></font><br>
Brahmin, there is Devī Kavach which is most secret and useful to all beings.<br>
Please listen to that, O Great Sage.<br>
The following nine names have been told by the Great Soul Brahmadeva<br>
Himself. Durgā is known by these names:<br>
<font color="red">1st ŚHAILAPUTRĪ (Daughter of the King of Himalayas)<br>
2nd BRAHMACHĀRIṆĪ (One Who observes the state of Celibacy)<br>
3rd CHANDRAGHAṆṬĀ (One Who use the Moon as Her bell)<br>
4th KUṢHMĀṆDĀ (Mother's lap)<br>
5th SKANDAMATA (Mother of Śhrī Kārttikeya)<br>
6th KATYAYANI (Who incarnated to help the Devas)<br>
7th KALARATRI (Who is even the destroyer of Kali)<br>
8th MAHAGAURI (Ādi Kuṇḍalinī)<br>
9th SIDDHIDATRI (Giver of all Siddhis)<br>
10th ŚHRĪ ĀDI ŚHAKTI (Śhrī Mātājī Nirmalā Devī)"</font><br>
(from the Kavach of the Devī: Navarātri Nights, Pune 1988-10) 
</p>

<p>
The first day of Navarātri this year falls on the 17th of October. This day is signified as God’s desire to create the universe which is called Ghaṭasthāpanā (laying of the foundation) and Śhrī Gaṇeśha is worshipped as the first creation. Ghaṭasthāpanā also involves symbolically growing grains around the Kalash.<br>
For Ghaṭasthāpanā following guidelines have been suggested:
</p>

<p>
<b>Things required for Ghaṭasthāpanā:</b><br>
* Ghaṭa (kalash) made of earth/Copper/brass<br>
* Coconut- decorated as we decorate for Pūjā Kalash<br>
* A big plate filled with 1/2 soil- Plate can be made of earth/copper/brass<br>
* 10 Mango or Betel (Pan) leaves<br>
* One handful Nine Grains (Nava-dhanya) or Whole Wheat Grains (soaked in normal water, night before the first day of Navarātri)<br>

</p>

<p>
