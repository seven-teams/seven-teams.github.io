<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Today is a special day of Guru Nāṇaka's birthday.</b><br>
Uh we have celebrated one Guru Pūjā uh-uh-uh ... and the, as you know that Guru Nāṇak was also the Incarnation of the Primordial Master, the same Spirit came on this Earth. And the He's the One who tried to re-establish the work of Muhammad.<br>
Muhammad was the Incarnation of the same Spirit, the Primordial Master. He came on this Earth to establish the religion.<br> 
Islam is the name of that religion, is the religion of every Sahaja Yogi, of every Christian, of every Hindu. We all belong to One Religion which believes in expanding our ourne ... awareness to the new perception of collectivity: from human level to the higher level, where you can perceive and manifest the Divine Power. This is the religion we are following.<br>
<b>All the religions were established on this Earth to create the seekers. You are the seekers: you are the Men of God. Now, all of you have to become Prophets.</b> And to become Prophets, today's Sahaja Yoga has taken the form of Mahā Yoga. All of you have to become Prophets. "</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"Is a great thing we are worshiping today Guru Nāṇaka, that's Me, that may you become Great Guru Nāṇakas. 
All of Them were created by Ādi Śhakti.<br> 
All these Gurus were created by Her.</b><br>
And today I say that you all become as great as Guru Nāṇaka, as great as Moses, as great as Sāī Nāth, as great as Nāṇaka, Janaka, Muhammad. 
All [of you] have to become as great as all these Great Incarnations.<br>
Just desire, have earnestness in you and alertness to achieve it."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"Muhammad Sāhib Himself was born [again] as our Great Guru, Guru Nāṇaka. Guru Nāṇak was not a human being, He was not only a Paigambar [Prophet] but He was the Reincarnation of Ādi Guru, the Primordial Master, He was a Divine Personality. Of course, the people who were there at His time were so useless and gross people that they actually tortured His life and nobody followed Him. After His death is a different point. He also has said that it is the Primordial Mother who has created the Universe."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"This day, in the name of Nāṇaka, I bless you all with that great spirit of mastery, 
which you all should become the Great Prophets who are going to change all the men of God into Prophets."</b></font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkGreen">"Only this is the teaching of Guru Nāṇaka, this is what is called ‘Sikh’ [learning]. All the Saints of that age had the discretion to know who is a Saint and who is not. All the gurus incorporated their poems and experiences in Guru Grantha and that is why Guru Grantha is revered so much. Only the renowned gurus contributed to it. They were so spiritual that they did churning of all the religious Scriptures and put the substance in Guru Grantha.
That is what we do in Sahaja Yoga. We do not follow any particular Saint or Incarnation; we respect all of them and strike a balance. But all this was lost in words. People did not go deeper in them. That is why Kabīra has written “even the scholars went on reading and reading like fools, without absorbing anything.” That is how a race of fools was created."</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkGreen">"So, these Ten Principles, as I told you, They established [dharma]. They are created in the Void. As you see here the Void part, this part is made out of the water element. So, whatever miracles They did, had something to do with water, like They could create water anywhere they wanted to. They would not cure people. All of Them have created water in the desert or in the places where ... like in ... Nāṇaka has created a Pan̄jā Sāhab they call it, or everywhere They have been able to create water. Whatever They touched, They could create water out of it."</font><br>

Today on the auspicious day of Śhrī Guru Nāṇaka’s Birthday let us pray for the enlightenment and Self-realization of all humanity so that the wars and violence in the name of God in today’s world come to an end and people start understanding that religions are but the different flowers on one tree – the Tree of Life.<br>
On the auspicious occasion, we humbly offer the 19 invocations to Śhrī Guru Nāṇaka, compiled from Śhrī Mātājī's talks (mostly from the above 1982-1101 and 1999-1123 talks and 1995-0910 Śhrī Gaṇeśha Pūjā).
