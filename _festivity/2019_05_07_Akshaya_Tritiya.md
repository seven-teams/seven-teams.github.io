<font color="DarkRed">"Today we have gathered here to do the Pūjā of Ādi Kuṇḍalinī as well as your own Kuṇḍalinī.
First of all, I think this is the most important thing to understand about your own Kuṇḍalinī, as Self-realization is Self-knowledge. And the one who gives you Self-knowledge is this, your own Kuṇḍalinī, because when She rises She points it out what are the problems on your chakras.<br>
Now, we say that it is pure desire, but we do not know what purity means. It means your chaste desire. It means it has no lust, greed, anything in it. That power is your own mother and is settled in your triangular bone. She’s your own mother. She knows everything about you, it’s like a tape recorder. She knows everything about you and She is absolutely the knowledge – because She’s so pure."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Had a very nice Pūjā in Pune which I had to perform on the thirteenth because it is the date called <b>Akshaya Tritiya, means un-destructible [indestructible] third day of the moon. That’s actually nobody knew, but it is the Pūjā of the Kundalinī.</b> That day everybody felt very, very clear. Very clear. Pūjā was hardly for about half an hour, the real Pūjā of the Kuṇḍalinī. But everybody felt extremely clear and beautiful. So, that sort of Pūjā we should do tomorrow also, if possible, so that we’ll have the feelings of Sahasrāra completely opened out because even if Sahasrāra is opened, the rest of the chakras, if they are caught up then you have problems. It’s better to clear out all the chakras and then the Sahasrāra. So, tomorrow we’ll do the Pūjā in that fashion and I hope it will work out very well for all of you."</font><br>

what you are trying to do is to cleanse your Kundalini as well as please the Deities.<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"If you are the Spirit, then you have to achieve that state, by this way or that way, that is your birthright – is born with you, that’s why we call it Sahaja Yoga. <b>Sahaja means, saha is ‘with’, ja is ‘born with you’. That is the Yoga, the Union with the Divine. The Divine is the All-pervading Power of God’s Love, which is the subtle of subtler all-pervading.</b>
It exists in everything and you have to feel it. That’s what we call as the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost: Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost. In the Bible, there’s no description of Holy Ghost. This Kuṇḍalinī is the reflection of that Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost is the Desire of God, that’s the Power of God reflected within us as Holy Ghost, as Kuṇḍalinī, in three and a half coils: is our pure desire. All other desires that we have are impure because we have been desiring for this and that, we know economic laws are such that in general wants are not satiable. Why? Because those wants are not pure. So this is the power of Kuṇḍalinī, which resides in the triangular bone within yourself."</font><br>

Dear Brothers and Sisters,<br>
Jai Shri Mataji!<br>
Today falls the auspicious day of Akshaya Tritiya, It falls on the third Tithi (lunar day) of Bright Half (Shukla Paksha) of the Indian month of Vaishakha.(Late April/May).<br> 
Akshaya Tritiya is one of the most significant day according to Indian calendar. On this day the Sun and the Moon are evidently the most radiant and astronomically it is believed to enlighten the earth with maximum light. It is believed that any meaningful activity started  or valuable brought on this day are considered to bring good fortune.<br>
Let us all worship Shri Mataji sakshat Shri Adi Shakti and pray for eternally rich spiritual life at Her Holy Lotus Feet.<br>
