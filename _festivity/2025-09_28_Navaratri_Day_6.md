<font color="DarkRed">"This is a <b>worship of the Śhakti</b>. Until now many Saints, Sages have known and revealed about this Śhakti. Whatever they could not describe in prose, they tried to convey by poetry. Whatever description was not possible to put in words -- they composed different names of the Devī and described. We know all this and many people also know the meaning of this. But one thing they perhaps do not know is that <b>every human being has all these śhaktis, powers dormant in them and they can awaken them. These dormant powers are eternal and limitless</b>.<br> 
Besides the thirty-three crores of Devas, there are many Śhaktis. But we can say that this Self-realization that we have achieved today, has been achieved through working of some Śhakti or the other. Without this you could not have achieved the Self-realization."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today it's such a great day for Me to be with you all, again this year. It's so very joyous and full of fragrance. Today we have decided to have a Pūjā of Śhakti that is the Power, that is the Devī. You know within us there are many Powers of Mahākālī, Mahāsaraswatī, Mahālakṣhmī, Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
All these Powers are there for us to ascent. If these Powers are properly used and understood, then your ascent can be permanent. Once you achieve your ascent and enter into the Kingdom of God, all these Powers get enlightened.<br>
And these Powers which are enlightened are absolutely filled with Love. Enlightenment, we have to understand that we get completely enlightened by Love. So after enlightenment, <b>after Realization we use only one Power which is of Love</b>."</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Today we have gathered to do Pūjā of the Śhakti.<br>
Śhakti means all the Śhaktis and not any one special śhakti. All these Śhaktis are situated on all our chakras and without these Śhaktis no work of the Devatās can be carried out. Like you know that the Śhakti of Kṛiṣhṇa is Rādhā and Rām's Śhakti is Sītā, Viṣhṇu's is Lakṣhmī. So in the same way the abode of the Śhaktis is with the Devatās. <b>The Devatās cannot do anything without the Śhakti. That sole Śhakti is situated in the center Heart as Jagadambā. This Jagadambā Śhakti is very powerful. You know that She lives as a mother or a wife with the Devatās. Worship of the Śhakti means that there will be a Pūjā of all the Śhaktis of the Devatās.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>To all devotees and followers of truth, who have assembled here for the Pūjā, I offer My protection.</b><br>
In this Kali Yug of today, when so much devotion and homage for the Mother, and so much love comes into the hearts of human beings, then we can know that Satya Yuga has begun.<br>
This is a most fortunate and divine coincidence for Me also, that on a Ṣhaṣhṭhī Day I came to Kolkata [arrival on 196-1009]. Because, in the Śhāstras it is written that the coming of the Mother is always on Ṣhaṣhṭhī Day. <b>Ṣhaṣhṭhī Day is of Śhākambharī Devī</b>, and on that day the whole nature should be green and lush.
