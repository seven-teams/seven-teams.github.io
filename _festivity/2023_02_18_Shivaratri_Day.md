<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are here to celebrate Mahāśhivarātri.</b><br>
It’s a very great privilege for all of us to understand about Śhrī Mahādeva. Unless and until you have got your Self-realization you cannot understand what is the great personality, the character, and the Powers of Śhrī Mahādeva.<br>
Is not easy to conceive, also to reach the depth, of His greatness unless and until we are humble. We have to be very humble to reach at the Lotus Feet of Śhrī Mahādeva. As you have seen that one has to cross even the Sahasrāra to be at the Lotus Feet of this great personality. He is beyond, beyond all our conception, but He resides in our hearts as the Spirit, and is reflected very well when you get your Realization."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"I have told you about the origin before.<br>
<b>Because on the Day of Mahāśhivarātri, when there is a talk about Śhivjī, then it has to begin with origin.<br>
How much He is Primordial, means when there is a first manifestation of form of God Almighty.</b><br>
He is called as Sadāśhiva when He is enlightened from Brahma.<br>
That is why the one who is Śhivjī is called as Ādi [Primordial].<br>
You see, before the complete manifestation of any tree its seed has to be seen first and that is why it has to be called ‘Bīj Swarūpa’ – form of the seed.<br>
That is why the glory of Śhiva is very important.<br>
After that, after His manifestation, the power within Him gets Her form and is called as Ādi Śhakti."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we are going to worship Śhiva Tattwa within us, Principle of Śhiva.</b><br>
For all Sahaja Yogis it’s very important, for [as] Śhiva is the ultimate we have to achieve. Śhiva is represented in our Spirit, so to become Śhiva is the ultimate aim of everything else. The rest of it is all created, like Viṣhṇu Tattwa and Brahmadeva, just to create human beings, to evolve them, and then ultimately lead them to Śhiva. That’s the Ultimate.<br>
But human beings get so involved into the Brahmadeva’s Tattwas that even to get into Viṣhṇu Tattwa is difficult. They get into involved into the five elements which have created us. That is the outermost being within us. All the chakras have the outermost, we can say, the ... just the vessel. But the desire to be the Spirit is of primal importance in Sahaj Yog."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Śhiva Tattwa is innocent, absolutely innocent it is. It’s very powerful and extremely innocent. And the secret to achieve it is only just to please, just please Him. If you please Śhiva, then you may be a rākṣhasa or anything, He grants all kinds of boons. But <b>to a rākṣhasa, He can only grant the boon of longevity, of long life. But to a Saint, He’ll grant the Sat-chit-ānanda State</b>."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"We have all assembled here to worship Lord Śhiva. <b>Śhiva Pūjā is a very great and special Pūjā. The ultimate aim of human beings is to attain that Śhiva Tattwa.</b> Śhiva Tattwa is beyond the brain. It cannot be known through the brain. Till you have got your Self-realization you cannot know the Self, Ātmā or the Śhiva Tattwa.<br> 
Too much falsehood, myth, and blind faith has taken place in the name of Lord Śhiva. Till a person is self-realized he cannot know Lord Śhiva because his nature is such that to know him, a person has first to attain that height where all the great virtues themselves enshrine within.<br> 
...... These Śhaktis reside within us through the Śhiva Tattwa. To attain the Śhiva Tattwa Self-realization is essential. Kuṇḍalinī is the Śhakti and the chakras are the steps. One has to ascend all the steps to attain the Śhiva Tattwa. This is the revelation of all the Gods and Deities. This is their job and they are completely absorbed in it. Unlike human beings, they do not think about themselves or their rank, etc. They are a part and parcel of Lord Śhiva. To facilitate human ascent to the Śhiva Tattwa is their nature.<br> 
They need not be lectured or told anything, they are completely submerged in their task. They work in karma. They do not think they are doing anything. They are thoughtless and unmindful for their powers, like sugar gives sweetness to food, but is unaware that it is sweet. Similarly, when Sahaja Yogis act they are not aware of the Śhakti within which is behind their actions. If the consciousness comes that I am the doer, I am a leader, etc. then you are not a Sahaja Yogi. Through Sahaja Yoga one becomes a karmi. He keeps performing without even remembering that he is doing anything. He does not even realize that he is loving though others find him very loving."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Except for Śhiva Tattwa, what other friend you need?</b> Think of it, without God, what is your life?<br>
So the detachment must start, the priorities must change and <b>you must know that God is the One who is your Friend, who is your Father, who is your Mother, who is to be worshiped, there is nothing else.

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"I had told that Śhiva Pūjā means more explanation, more understanding, more this thing; because in other Pūjās we do all these mantras, this, that, but <b>in this Pūjā is to know the knowledge, it’s God.</b><br>
And to know that you know God itself is so great. Whatever it is – She may be Mahāmāyā, She may be anything, but I know Her. It cannot be described in one book, it cannot be described in hundred books.<br>
It cannot be described in words, but to know that’s God – after all, that’s God, God Almighty. And that gives you that beautiful surrender, where you just feel absolutely secured in that Ocean of Love.
I wish you all to achieve that state.<br>
May God bless you".</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"The aspect of Śhrī Śhiva is found in our heart. Whenever somebody becomes the Spirit, I am not saying gets enlightened, but when the <b>Kuṇḍalinī gets awakened this Principle of Śhrī Śhiva gets enlightened. This light first comes into our brain and our heart and thus for the first time there is Yoga, i.e., Union of the brain and the heart</b>. Otherwise, normally there is no relation between man’s heart and his brain. They each run in separate directions. This light which is emitted from the Spirit flows through our hands and fontanel bone areas as vibrations."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Śhiva is your Guru. Guru is the one that gives you the gravity to go straight down, deep into it.</b><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"But when He finds that in the play of Ādi Śhakti, the people or the world as such, try to disturb Her or to spoil Her work, then He gets into His wrathful mood, and He destroys all such people, and maybe, He destroys the whole world.<br>
<b>On one side He’s wrathful, no doubt, on the other side, He is the Ocean of Compassion and Joy. That’s why, when He is reflected within us, we get our Self-realization, we get the light of our Spirit and we get into the Ocean of Joy.</b><br>
Also He is the Ocean of Knowledge, so those who get self-realized get the Knowledge of the Divine, which is very subtle, permeating into every atom and molecule, the Power of this Knowledge is there. His style is such that, in his compassion, He forgives even very cruel rākṣhasas, if they dedicate themselves to Him. Because His Compassion has no limits and sometimes the same people who are blessed by Him try to trouble the devotees of Ādi Śhakti – but it is just to create a drama, an event."</font><br>

<font color="indigo"><b>O Most Auspicious and Compassionate Lord, beloved of Śhrī Pārvatī, father of Śhrī Gaṇeśh and Śhrī Kārttikeya, not even one blade of grass moves without Your willing it so. Śhrī Ādi Śhakti has created all these planets, worlds, rivers and seas, humans, animals, and plants, in the eternal play of creation - only to be pleasing to You. And in complete joy, and complete detachment, You witness it all. She did all of this out of great kindness and mercy so that we, Your bhaktas, could find You again and again in the depths of our being.</b><br>
O Lord, You are the Absolute, the Fundamental Principle, the Transcendent and Unchanging Truth. You have neither beginning nor end. You are the very origin of the Self, You are both formless and omnipresent in every form. We worship You as the first syllable Auṃ. Verily You are the Creator and the Preserver. You are the Source of all knowledge. All sublime Arts and aesthetics flow from You.<br>
<b>Salutations to The Eternal Yogi, whose pale skin has the dazzling brilliance of ten million suns. You are eternally and blissfully in meditation. You reside in the snowy white peaks of Mount Kailasha, and You reside in our heart chakra; Your love sustaining each particle of creation. Verily You are the embodiment of innocence, utterly beautiful to behold.  Salutations to The Ascetic One, detached from all worldly comforts, whose radiant form is smeared with ashes. The skin of a fierce and majestic tiger adorns You. Your trident is poised to destroy all evils. And the rhythmic drum beat of Your damaru controls the beating hearts of each living soul.</b><br>
Verify You are Śhrī Neelkant whose throat has turned blue from consuming all the poisons of this entire world. You are the one who defeats the seven enemies of the soul, thus ending all worldly desires and delusions. You wear a rosary of holy Rudraksha seeds said to be made from Thine own tears of compassion. Salutations to Trilochana whose Lotus Eyes brim with love.<br>
<b>To meditate upon You is to drop into the ocean of Sachchidānanda, so that the meditating Saints and Sages of all times sing Your glories. Salutations to the One with disheveled and matted locks that billow in the mountain breezes carrying forth Thy divine fragrance; for verily You are the Lord of the Wind. You are our life breath and our lifeline. The shining crescent moon is worn as a jewel in the midnight black of Your hair, and You wear a necklace of glittering stars. From the sacred crown of Your topknot, the River Gaṅgā cascades in a joyful, purifying stream into our upturned palms as Cool Vibrations.</b><br>
We praise You as Śhrī Paśhupati, Lord and protector of animals. Your faithful servant Nandi, the bull calf, is Your Vāhana.  All creatures great and small seek Thy refuge, even those animals most feared by man. In Thy benevolence, You offer even the serpents the warmth of Your body to protect them from the icy chill of the Himalayas. Verily You are Śhrī Nnāgabhūṣhaṇa wearing a garland of snakes in three coils, representing the primordial Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
<b>We praise the One who stands on one foot, poised beyond and above the three worlds. The wise beings of all kalpas, lokas and yugas, who only exist by Your will, bow down in great thankfulness and ask for forgiveness at Your Lotus Feet. We worship Lord Naṭarāj whose cosmic Tāṇḍava Dance, in the never-ending cycle of time, eventually brings the whole universe to an end.  And we pull our ears now, we seek forgiveness for any mistakes we may make in this Pūjā. We pray that Śhrī Gaṇeśha and all the deities be present. We ask forgiveness for our attention straying from the blissful realm of spirit. And pray, please remove all ignorance, egoism, attachments, and delusions, that hinder our spiritual growth as Sahaja Yogis. Oh, Mahādeva, O Giver of Boons, please bestow auspiciousness, wisdom, and peace upon us all, may we be completely drenched by the pure joy of Bhakti.</b></font><br>
