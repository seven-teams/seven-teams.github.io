<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now for Pūjā, one has to understand that without Realization, Pūjā has no meaning, because you are not ananya.</b> Is, you have to become aware of your whole. Kṛiṣhṇa’s description of bhakti is ananya. He says, “I will give you Ananya Bhakti,” He wants Ananya Bhakti, means when there is not the other, means when we are realized.<br>
.. Now Pūjā is the left-hand side projection. It’s the neutralization of the right side, very much. Specially for people who are very right-handed, atmosphere which is very right-handed, Pūjā is ideal for them. <b>Is the bhakti, is the devotion ... that you project.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So the ascent starts evolving. In that, the play of the Devī is the Navarātri – in your ascent – from ages. Navarātri that’s why is the most important Pūjā. <b>In Sahaja Yoga, Navarātri is the most important Pūjā I would say. Though we can say in modern Sahaja Yoga Sahasrār Day is, because that’s how you started getting your Realization. But if you go to the whole historical events of evolution you’ll find [that] Navarātri is the one which has brought you to Sahasrāra. Without the help of the Devī at different stages of your ascent, you could not have been in a position to receive your Realization. So all the steps that you took in the past are today worshipped and are used for thanking the Devī for what She did to bring you down here. So it’s like a thanksgiving. Without Her work nothing could have happened.</b><br>
So when we read about the Devī, about Her Incarnations: how She came on this Earth to save Her bhaktas, people who were trying to ascend, to cross this Bhavasāgara, how She worked hard, how She fought the devils, how She fought, She killed the demons single-handed, She took upon Herself the responsibility of making the people cross the Bhavasāgara.<br>
Guru gave you the strength to have dharma but She is the one who brought you out. Even those who were dhārmik could not do it because of the demonic pressure. She’s the one who fought single-handed with Her Powers of destruction. In Her Love, for you She fought. She brought you to this level. And then She took a milder form of Incarnation. Even during the time of all the Gurus She took the form of, as you know, Jānakī was the daughter of Janaka, then Fāṭimah was the daughter of Muhammad Sāhib and Nāṇakī was the sister of Nāṇaka. In those forms, these Powers sustained and nourished the Guru Tattwa.<br>
And later on, or sometimes simultaneously, They incarnated in milder forms to help human beings to rise. So today is the day of thanksgiving. As Guru Pūjā is a day of thanksgiving to your Guru, the One who has counseled you, the One who has told you about the Truth, the One who has taught you the Truth and has given you Realization. And the Devī Pūjā is a thanksgiving where single-handed, just like a very loving Mother, under Her sāṛī, She protected you, fought for you, fought with every enemy that is around, every sort of problems that existed and ultimately brought [you] into Sahasrāra level and then gave you Realization. It’s a real thanksgiving to the Mother.<br>
<b>So we can say Navarātri is like a Mother’s Day where you give thanksgiving to Her: which was just relentless, continuous working for Her children.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"You come up now to the Heart chakra. Heart chakra is divided into three parts. In the center of the Heart chakra resides Jagadambā Herself. But [in] the left side as I have told you resides Śhiva and His Power is Pārvatī. <b>When Pārvatī Herself separates Her identity with Her Lord and enters in the center to save Her children from the domination of the evil spirits, then She resides in the center and She is the Jagadambā. This is called as “Sacred Heart” in the Bible. She resides as Jagadambā. She has taken many Incarnations to save.</b><br>
Today there was Lalitā Pañchamī, they sang the song of Lalitā. The way She took Her Incarnations to fight the evil forces, to save the bhaktas from the domination of satanic and depraving personalities. She is there within you also, if not awakened She can be awakened. She is all the time there to save you from those satanic forces."</font><br>

Dear All,<br>
Jai Shri Mataji!<br>
Today on Panchami, we celebrate the 5th day of Navaratri.<br>
This day as Shri Mataji spoke in 1988, the Devi killed the rakshasas, chanda and munda, and the Devi was called Shri Chamunda.<br>
This day we also worship the Durga in Her form of  Shri Skandmata (The Mother of Shri Kartikeya). She is described as holding a lotus in one hand and the baby Shri Kartikeya in another.<br>
Shri Skandamata is the form of Devi who is fierce as well as very gentle and soft.<br>
On this day, the fifth night of Navaratri, we also sing Jogawa.<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"This song that you have heard has been composed in the year of 1600. And in this song the poet has sung for the rustic people, in their language. That, “Oh Mother, give us our Realization!” ‘Jogawa’ means the Yoga, the Union with the Divine and the Sahaja Yoga means spontaneous. It fills My heart to see how since long the seekers have been asking for this Union with the Divine. What a search! What a seeking!</font><br>
