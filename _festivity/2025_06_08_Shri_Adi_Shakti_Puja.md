<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we are worshiping Ādi Śhakti.<br>
I think this is the most important Pūjā, because it is the Power of Ādi Śhakti that has given you Self-realization, that has given you the Truth, that has given you the Power of Compassion and Love.</b><br>
That's the power that separated from Sadāśhiva. And this Power wanted Herself to create this Complete Universe: universes after universes. She's creating and loving. With Her love, She did this Great Creation, Creation of this world also.<br>
This is a specially selected planet, which was very beautifully brought in the center, between the Sun and the Moon, for the creation of, ultimately, the human beings.<br>
This is Her great work [done] with such love and affection, and with very great hope that Her children will know the Truth and will get the Ultimate Knowledge about themselves, and about everything else."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we are all going to worship Me, first time. It has been always the Pūjā of [an] aspect of Me or a part of Me.</b><br> 
Now, one has to know very clearly what is Ādi Śhakti. As we say, is the Pure Desire of God Almighty, of Sadāśhiva. But what is the pure Desire of God Almighty?<br>
If you see your own desires, come out of what? Not out of the Divine Love but out of carnal love, out of material love, of out of power love. Behind all these desires there is love.<br>
If you do not love something you will not desire it. So, these mundane types of love that you have, for which we spend so much of our time uselessly, actually they do not give you satisfaction, because that is not true love that you have. Just infatuation for the time being, and then you just get fed up with it, and from there you jump to another thing, to another thing, to another thing.<br>
<b>So Ādi Śhakti is the Embodiment of God's Divine Love, is God's Pure Love, and in His Love what did He desire? He desired that He should create human beings, who would be very obedient, would be sublime, would be like angels. And that was His idea: to create Adam and Eve.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Pūjā, as I have told you many a times, is not for My benefit, by any chance, take it from Me. I'm much better off without it. Because when the enthusiastic Deities start emitting vibrations with your im... asking. Because you are Saints, so They just, They are overenthusiastic. And They are sitting there, busybodies, you know [soft laughter]. They are sitting quietly waiting for a chance, you see, to emit vibrations, to save you, you see, They want to just rush.</b> They emit so much [laughing:] that They lose, `Just wait, just wait.' They want to save you, They want to give you, They're so anxious, in Their anxiety to save you. I like it, to see the way They are anxious. But [laughs] ... but you don't suck it and I have a problem there. Once They've given They don't want to take it back. You don't suck it, so it has to go to the atmosphere, it has to disappear somewhere. Is directed towards you and you don't take it, so where does it go? It hangs into My tissues, it pains Me.<br>
So, sucking should be more. Sucking should be more. And just before the Pūjā you should say: `Mother, make me such that I suck more of the Divine!' Just pray that, with sincerity from your heart, just say that."</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Love is the Message of Ādi Śhakti.<br>
Now you think about it. One Ādi Śhakti created the whole world.</b> How She must have done it. What She must have planned. How She must have organized. It is not a[n] easy thing. Only because She loved.<br>
Love is the expression that you are all there. That is why to be one with Her one should learn to love.<br>
Of course in that you have to know that you should forgive. If you don't know how to forgive and find mistakes of other people you won't help. What is your now job is, is to see that you are loving, no hatred for anyone, you don't think of hating anyone and hitting somebody.<br>
This has to work out."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>But many universes have been created by Ādi Śhakti, even before us.</b> And She has tried many other things also. Ultimately She has tried this: She has created Earth and then created us. Now how She has done that we'll see later on. Just now let us see how She assumes Her ... Her Power.<br>
<b>When She decides to create, She is endowed with Three Powers: She has Three Powers of God which are granted to Her.<br>
By one power, first of all, is the existence, the desire to exist, She desires to exist with God.<br>
The second power is to create and the third power is to sustain.<br>
First power is existence, second is to create and the third is the evolving power or sustainance [sustenance] power by which gradually you sustain something and you become something. These are the Three Powers She assumes.<br>
In short, we can say that She forms Three Powers of Mahākālī, Mahāsaraswatī and Mahālakṣhmī. These are the Three Powers She assumes within Herself.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So, in that reflection that you are Me, in that rekflection [reflection] that the Mother Earth is Me</b>, in that beautiful creation within you, you have to become very sensitive to the need of the world, what is the need of the world. <b>Today, if you fail, the whole thing will fail forever.</b> Only very few will be there. So the need for you is: to spread Sahaja Yoga because this love is not only for you. Is not to be enjoyed [only] by you, but is to be enjoyed by as many possible in the whole world.<br>
<b>So, today we have to decide that, as the children of Ādi Śhakti, we have to go all out, everywhere, every corner, we have to shout and we have to tell loudly what is the time in which we are living and what is the responsibility that you have to fulfill as Sahaja Yogis.</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"But in India people talked about Kuṇḍalinī since long ago, and [they know] that She is the Ādi Śhakti, reflected within us. Now you see she has already read it out to you that I will be in every one of them. Now understand that this <b>Ādi Śhakti is the Power of Love, of Pure Love, of Compassion. There is nothing else She has: only the Pure Love within Her heart. But this Pure Love is so powerful, is so powerful! That is the Love She has given to this Mother Earth.</b> Because of that, this Mother Earth, [in spite of] the amount of sins we may commit -- we may do anything -- is pouring out Her Love through these beautiful things to all us.<br>
Now, we have also this beauty expressed in every way of Her Love, through the galaxies you see, the stars you see.<br>
Now, if you want to see it from a scientific way, then science means ... it has no love in it there's no question of love. Even people talk of Yoga but they don't talk of love and compassion. When there is no love and compassion, there cannot be any divine spark in that person. Everything is non completely submerged in this Divine Love. Everything that is created on this Earth, everything that is created in this universe, and universes, and universes, is all because of the Love of the Divine Mother."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Now, uh for us uh-uh-uh to worship Ādi Śhakti ... I don't know also because there have been no prayers or anything about Ādi Śhakti. Up to Bhagavatī they have gone, but beyond Bhagavatī they have not gone, so I do not know what sort of Pūjā we will have, but let's try something. Maybe, <b>I think the meditation is the best way we can really achieve something.</b><br>
So we can go into meditation for about five minutes.<br>
