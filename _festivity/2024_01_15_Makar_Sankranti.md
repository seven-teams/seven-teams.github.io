<font color="DarkRed">"T<b>oday is Saṅkrānti. Saṅkrānti means that today there is something new going to happen.</b> Kuṇḍalinī has awakened within you and you have become new person compared to what you were before. But on the day of Saṅkrānti, you should know that you have to please the Goddess who is sitting within you. What should you do to make Her happy? You distributed sesame seeds and jaggery. That is for love. To increase the love between each other, we give sesame seeds and jaggery.<br>
Today the Sun left its place and, in its northward movement, came towards us. At this moment we should be very thankful to the Sun. It is by the grace of the Sun that so many things take place in our country. We have to do namaskār to the Sun today and His Power and His knowledge should come to us. I would say that all of you have become realized and vibrations are flowing through you. Now you should make use of these vibrations, establish the śhakti within you, establish the peace within you and show the world that this power is within us and we have to acquire it. We have to nurture this, improve this with your good qualities and truthful speech.<br>
Today is very special day because the Sun is particularly benevolent towards us on this day. And we should thank Him for all this. You have received a lot, there is more to come and you will get much more. We should increase it. All of you did so many Pūjās to Me. I am surprise to know what you want from all these Pūjās?"</font><br>

<font color="Chocolate"><b>Saṅkrānti means Power of the Sun. Sun power means self-confidence. Sun gives us heat and light. Now it depends on us whether to get scorched from the heat of the Sun or gain self-confidence from the light of the Sun and become radiant.<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is the day where we celebrate the change of the axis of the Sun and that He moves towards the Tropic of Cancer.<br>
Tropic of Cancer is the one which represents the motherhood, the motherhood of the Earth.</b> This Tropic of Cancer has passed through quite a big area of land while the Tropic of Capricorn has not. And the area through which it has passed it has created different beautiful manifestation of the motherhood qualities on this Earth.<br>
We celebrate this change because the Sun has now moved into the new dimension so that all over the world there will be the warmth of the Sun. "</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"To speak in a very sweet manner is a sign of good breeding, good culture and fear of God. <b>Those who fear God will never speak rudely to another person, because in another person also the same Spirit is shining</b> and why should we be sharp or angry with another person who is created by God Almighty as we are created.<br>
So this loving, beautiful relationship that we have with each other, after Sahaja Yoga especially, let us express in talking to each other sweetly. There are so many ways by which we could be sweet. There are little, little things if you do, you can create lot of sweetness, but you need not a sharp tongue, but a sharp memory."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"As we consider <b>Sun's appearance as a very great thing, it is much more important, that the Sun of Sahaja Yoga comes on this Earth</b>. Because whatever creativity is in this Universe, the creativity is nourished by the Sun. The Sun gives it the energy, and the Creative Power of the Paramachaitanya, its aspect of action, has got activated through Sahaja Yoga. Till now Paramachaitanya was not successful in any task. The reason was, that the Sun had not yet appeared in its courtyard. But now this Sun has risen in the courtyard of Paramachaitanya. And because of that you all have the light of it within you. Because of that light, your Kuṇḍalinī has awakened, and within you, the field of creation has fully blossomed. And this field of creation you all are developing, in a way that the whole world can benefit from it. And it's a very great and divine thing. This could not take place earlier. <b>In our country many Sages have expressed many ideas about, that such a day will come, when collectively this creation will get awakened.</b><br>
That creation has awakened now. And that's why this is not only an occasion for Earth's creation but a great occasion for Sahaja Yoga's creation also. This year specially is considered to be a very important year for Sahaja Yoga, and the light of Sahaja Yoga will establish very deeply in the people. When something starts to establish deeply, then we must understand that along with it, some other important events also take place."</font><br>

<font color="Chocolate">"<b>Now the Sun is so much respected in this country, that in early morning time all the people get up and say namaskārs to Sūrya with all His names and do a particular type of exercise to show that they are completely surrendered to the will of the Sūrya.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"For India, today is a very important day because the Sun is coming from the south to the north side.<br>
<b>The most important thing in Sahaja Yoga is that you have to change and that's what you should do to the Goddess with changed heart, full of love, affection and kindness.<br>
Therefore, hope you will spread Sahaja Yoga. It is very important because you know My vision is too big and you have to really work hard to fulfill My vision.</b> And to give Realization to people as many as possible. You have to think what is your mind doing. There are many people who are waiting to come in Sahaja Yoga. You should have the light of spirituality: you have to feel that you are spiritual, you have to grow it, and also make others grow.<br>
Sahaja Yoga is not limited with you. It's not meant for one individual, not at all for one person but for the whole world. We have Sahaja Yogis all over the world, but they don't spread Sahaja Yoga. They are satisfied with their own motives. This is not Sahaja Yoga. You must openly talk about and say about it. But Sahaja Yogis are very shy, they don't talk about Sahaja Yoga. They can do it, no doubt.<br>
The Sun changes its direction, everybody knows about it, everybody prays for it.<br>
People take bath in the River Ganges for purification. This is all right.<br>
<b>Now it is a time for purification, identification and also of understanding the importance of Sahaja Yoga.</b> I don't know how many people really understand the importance of Sahaja Yoga. If that is understood, one can do a lot of work in Sahaja Yoga. It is such a noble work, which you all have to do it collectively. And then you feel your life has a meaning, otherwise there is no meaning and no light in your life. So you have to work out in that manner which gives inspiration to others."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"So, today's special day, a very great day, let us ask that, when you are doing this Pūjā, ask: for new religions within you, `to be enshrined, to be sustained within ourselves.' And try to imbibe them. They will be permeating but you have to accept them.<br>
And [you] should know it's a big fight. And it's a very different type of a fight: of peace and love.<br>
That's why they say: `Speak sweetly, be sweet to each other.'<br>
Not to be sarcastic by any chance, nor to be harsh, but be sweetch [sweet]. Sweetness which is genuine: not outward and showy and formal, but genuine sweetness.<br>
May God bless you all."</b></font><br>
