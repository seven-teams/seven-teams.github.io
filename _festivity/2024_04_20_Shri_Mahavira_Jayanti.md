<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are going to celebrate the birthday of Mahāvīra.<br>
Mahāvīra is the Incarnation of Bhairavanāth, or you call Him as Saint Michael.</b> Now these two Saints as you know one as the Gabriel, Hanumāna, and another is Saint Michael. One is placed on the Piṅgalā nāḍī and another one, Saint Michael, on the Iḍā nāḍī.<br>
So, Mahāvīra had to go through lots of search. Of course He was a[n] angel, but came as human being and He had to find out the thing of the left side, and how the left side acts. It's a very complicated thing, left side, is much more complicated than right side. On the left side we have also seven nāḍīs, and these seven nāḍīs are placed one after another. They are described in books and given different names to them. Now these seven nāḍīs that are on the left side, as you know, they cater to our past. Say for example, every moment becomes a past. Every present becomes a past. Then we have past of this lifetime, and also we have past of our previous lives. Then all the past is built in within us since our creation."</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="blue">"Now, Mahāvīra also was one of Them, who ... who was born again and again, and He was Mārkaṇḍeya, and He was Kabīra.<br>
The way Kabīra lashes people, you can see that He is tremendous! <b>He is like Bhairava!</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"The ascetic life of Mahāvīra was of a very, very extreme nature. He was the one who was born in a ... uh ... clan of warriors, Kṣhatriyas. And then He was also married, also He had a daughter. And then He decided, because He knew He had to do the work of the Divine, He decided to take a saṃnyāsa. So He took uh the permission of His brother because His parents were dead. He was a king, so He gave up all His uh material wealth, everything and He beg ... became a complete saṃnyāsī. And the He left His family, His left His ... house, everything behind and went alone with a little bowl for begging alms. And there people who joined Him were very few, and He asked them that, "You have to also become ascetics," Munis.<br>
He was a Reincarnation of Saint Michael and He resides on the left side, on the Iḍā nāḍī. And He looks after the whole of it, right from Mūlādhāra onwards up to the Sahasrāra. So Saint Michael was born as Mahāvīra, meaning The Greatest Warrior. But when He was born, the whole place got lot of uh prosperity, that's why <b>He was called as Vardhamān, to begin with.</b>"</font><br>

</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>After they get their Realization, that He called as Kevalagyān: only the knowledge, only knowledge, means Pure Knowledge.</b> They will develop some Samyak Darśhan, means Integrated Personality and all the Collective Consciousness. He talked of all, all these things.<br> 
But as He belonged to the left side, He has described Hell very clearly. Fundamentally, basically there are Fourteen Hells according to Him. And is horrible to read all that, what He has described about Hell. Because He wanted to tell people that, 'If you do all these wrong things, you'll go to Hell.'<br> 
And He talked about, not about Form, Formly God, but Formless God, because He didn't want people to again start ritualism but get to right ... right to the position where they could get their Self-realization to cleanse themself.<br>
So you can imagine: how difficult, in those days at Mahāvīra, was even to be one of the candidates for Self-realization. It's frightening for you! <b>That's why I never had this uh Pūjā. Because to do all these things, first of all, and to become absolutely pure, then only He would give Realization.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"That's why, <b>I think, this Mahāvīra Jayanti is a very great thing for us to observe.</b><br>
Now, why was He called Mahāvīra? Because only a person like Him -- Vir means a person who is brave, who is chivalrous -- because only He could do this, so only He could enter into the being fully and could kill or, you can say, destroy those horrible rākṣhasas, devils, all these negative things that come to us.<br>
Now, as you know, we use left side very much for so many negativity that is torturing us, but if there is no help, say, from Mahāvīra, we cannot do it. You call the name of Mahāvīra -- you could call Him Saint Michael, you can call Him by any name, but Mahāvīra because He was a human being. All this works out because of Him and He's such a great identity."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Even though Saraswatī has created all the Swaras, so what! <b>But the emotions it contains, the bhakti it contains it is due to the blessings of Mahāvīr.</b> Mahāvīr has really worked hard for this because he scared people that if you go to the wrong way, you go to hell, and on taking this correct way you will be overwhelmed and you all are actually witnessing it. Like this <b>we all should increase our bhakti and growing bhakti in the work of Mahāvīr. I am happy that on this day of Mahāvīr Jayanti you all are doing Mahāvīr's work</b> ......<br>
In Sahaja Yoga we recognize Lord Mahāvīra as the Incarnation of Śhrī Bhairavnāth. He also incarnated as Imam Husayn. Saint Michael is the same who is also called Saint George [the Guardian angel of London]."</font><br>
