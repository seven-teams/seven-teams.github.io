<font color="DarkRed">"It is such a joy today, and the whole atmosphere seems to be bubbling with it as if the angels are singing. And <b>the specialty of Hanumāna was that He was an angel.</b> Angels are born like angels. They are angels, and they are not human beings. They’re born with the angelic qualities. But now, you all have become angels from the human beings. It’s a very great achievement of Sahaja Yoga. The qualities that are born with the angels are seen from their very childhood.<br>
So <b>in the left side, we have gaṇas, on the right side, we have angels. And translated in Sanskrit language or in any Indian language as Devadūt – means they are the Ambassadors of Gods.</b> So now you are the same, you are all angels now. Only thing you are not aware that you are angels while they were aware from their childhood. If you know that you are angels, all your qualities will start shining through, and you’ll be amazed that the quality of standing by the Truth at any cost is so easily managed for you because you have been given the right, you have been given the special blessings, the special protection from the Divine that if you stand for the right, and if you stand for the righteous, and if you stand for the Truth, all kinds of help to protect you will be given."</font><br>

<font color="SaddleBrown">"<b>Today we have come here to do Hanumāna’s Pūjā.</b>
Śhrī Hanumāna is a great character in our being and He runs all the way from Swādhiṣhṭhāna to your brain and 
He supplies all the necessary guidance we need in our futuristic planning or in our mental activities.<br>
<b>He gives us guidance and protection.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="SaddleBrown">"What to say about Hanumāna? <b>The more powerful and wise, he was equally devoted and dedicated.</b> Generally, such a powerful person becomes right-sided and considers himself so high that he would not listen to anyone else. But Hanumāna is a special Deity, a typical Deity full of qualities. There was a perfect balance between his devotion and power. How could he achieve this balance is a thing to be understood.<br>
In Sahaja Yoga, when we are enlightened, we get many powers. Then we have to keep balance. We love others and with the power of the love, we keep on doing our duties.<br>
Śhrī Hanumāna was very powerful. He had many Divine Powers in Him Navadhā, that is Garima, Laghima, etc. He could be as big as he wanted to be and as small as an atom. He had achieved all these powers. Without attaining balance and coming to the central path. Such a powerful person generally goes crazy.<br>
<b>Each cell of Śhrī Hanumāna’s body was filled with power and devotion.</b> Because of this specialty today we worship Śhrī Hanumāna all over the world.</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Hanumāna’s whole life was spent in serving Śhrī Rām. And He was such a dedicated bhakta of Śhrī Rām.</b><br>
Now here the contrast is also that Hanumāna had Navadhā, Navadhā uh-uh Siddhis, Navadhā Siddhis, Nine Siddhis: the Aṇima, Garima, Raguma [Laghima], and all sorts of things, that He could become small, He could become big, He could ... it so many things He had. Despite all these siddhis and the amount the [of] power He had, that Śhrī Rāma once asked Him that, “My s... My ah-ah-ah brother now, uh Lakṣhmaṇa, is being hit and He’s very sick. I mean, He’s just dying, so you go and get a particular kind of a sañjīvanī, a kind of a[n] herb, is which I want to rub on His head.” So He went there and He found He couldn’t find it so He brought the whole of the mountain on His hand and [laughing:] gave it to Rāma, “Now You select! I don’t know, I can’t find it.” [Soft laughter.]<br>
<b>That is the Hanumāna Śhakti! And with all that power, He was such a humble person and such a dedicated person.<br>
This is the sign of a powerful Sahaja Yogi. Anybody who is powerful has to be humble and nonviolent.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="SaddleBrown">"Now, this conscience, which is Śhrī Hanumāna, is the subtle form of Him, which gives us, is in Sanskrit called as ‘sat-asat viveka buddhi’, means, sat means truth, asat means untruth 
and viveka means the discrimination and buddhi means the intelligence.<br>
<b>So, intelligence to discriminate between the truth and untruth is given to us by Śhrī Hanumāna.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Hanumāna, when He was born, and when He grew up, He forgot that time, and He forgot His Powers. So He was to be reminded</b> that, “You are such and such powerful person. You don’t know what Your Powers are, You a... You ate of the whole of Sūrya. This You did in your childhood. You are born with this power, but now after growing You are ... rather be ... sort of uh forgotten it, and also You are uh You were afraid of using them, and it’s uh, sort of looks like in a domin... dominant [dormant] position. But it is there. If You just try to remember them, it will come up."<br>
<b>They have tremendous power these people have, tremendous power. But they have to assume, and stand on that.</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="SaddleBrown">"<b>We say that Sahaja Yoga is the work of Divine Love.</b> It’s right, whether we know it or not, Its power is innate. It is Divine Power. When a human being bows before someone and regards him higher, it is the expression of that Divine Power. But when a person is respectful to his guru then he gets blessed with the grace and power of the guru.
So the devotion and the power (bhakti aur śhakti) are not different things. It is one. We shall say that the right side is the source of power and the left of bhakti. Śhrī Hanumāna had in Him this harmony of bhakti and śhakti."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"I hope by today’s Pūjā, that enthusiasm, that venturesome nature will vibrate your Piṅgalā, and without feeling any ego about it, in the most humble manner as Hanumāna was, you will do the jobs.<br>
Obedience is the only thing that helps to carry out your work and you’ll become humbler and humbler.<br>
But if you think, ‘Oh I am doing this’ – then finished. But if you know that it’s done by the Divine – ‘Paramachaitanya is doing everything, I am just an instrument’ – the humility will be there and you will be an effective instrument."</b></font><br>
