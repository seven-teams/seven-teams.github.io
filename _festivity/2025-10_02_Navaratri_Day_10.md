<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Don't worry about anything, just know that I am the Ādi Śhakti. That all the Powers of God and Goddesses and all that are within Me and they are within Me and they are all looking after you. But if that recognition is not there, they are not going to recognize you either.<br>
So for today's Navarātri, I have to tell you that ... just try to keep in mind that today you are worshiping the Ādi Śhakti and not only Durgā. And you are worshiping Durgā and all these Goddesses to thank them because, if they had not saved you that time, you had been so frightened, you would have become bad people and would not have been here. That is why we are thankful to them for saving us and giving us this protection at that time when we were very helpless.<br>
May God bless you!</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today to see you on this Navarātri Day, so many people sitting to worship Me. So many people are here, so many Sahaja Yogis, it’s so remarkable, it is not My achievement, I tell you. It’s your seeking.</b><br>
Because I have been on this Earth many a times before – that you know. But we never had like this, so many came and got crucified, died, this, that – but I never had people of this caliber."</font><br>

<br>
<font color="Navy"><b>We should devote ourselves to that Devī<br>
Who resides at the center of our lotus hearts,<br>
Whose glory is like that of the rising sun,<br>
Whose face is pleasing,<br>
Who grants all boons and protection,<br>
Who is three-eyed, Who wears red clothes, and<br>
Who fulfills the desires of Her devotees.</b></font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now the tenth Navarātri today is to celebrate actually the Ādi Śhakti. So today we are really going to worship the Ādi Śhakti.</b> On one side the Ādi Śhakti is Mahākālī, on the other side She is Mahāsaraswatī, in the center She is Mahālakṣhmī, and also She is the Ambā, the one who is the Kuṇḍalinī. But She’s also beyond that. She’s Parāśhakti, She’s beyond all the powers because She is the Generator of Power, so She has to be beyond all that.<br>
<b>So today when we are worshiping Her, we have to worship Her in all these forms.</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now you enter into the Kingdom of God. Then the Śhakti makes you sit on different beautiful positions, and some are sitting in the Heart of God, some are sitting in the Sahasrāra of God, in the Kingdom of God.</b><br>
Now you should assume your power. On Navarātri now, you should understand that it has now crossed the limit and now we are on the tenth position, where you must assume. I have told you many a times, now believe that you are Sahaja Yogis. Believe that you are, you have entered into the Kingdom of God. You cannot judge God, you cannot say why She does that, why She does that, why He does that. You cannot say that -- that's different. But when you sit there, then it is not an assembly, it is not like a politician fighting, no; it is that you have entered into the Kingdom of God, blessed by God, looked after, protected, nourished, and made knowledgeable.<br>
......<br>
So Navarātri's -- <b>now, the tenth day of Navarātri, which is the most important for all of you, is where this Paramachaitanya has become active. And by its activity you should know it is become very powerful, and that now anybody who tries to be nasty with you, tries to trouble you -- "I don't have to worry at all." It will take care of it.</b>"</font><br>

<br>
<font color="DarkRed">"...... on this day of this Pūjā, <b>it's such a combination that it's the Dussehra, I am here and also you can call it the last day of the Devī Pūjā</b>. We have to see within ourselves, introspect, 'What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So today is Dussehra, is a very big day in India.</b> They say on this day Rāvaṇa was killed. He was the worst enemy of human beings, and he was killed. But whatever it is then, as a memory of that great man, Śhrī Rām, they celebrate today Dussehra. And on this day, they say, those who are duṣhṭas, means bad people or we can say negative, they are killed. Can you imagine? [Chuckles.]
So this day is regarded as a very important day in India, and they make a big statue of Rāvaṇa. You all know who was Rāvaṇa, ...... whom Śhrī Rāma killed. He was a horrible fellow and he took away the wife of Śhrī Rām, Sītā, by force. But she was such a chaste woman that he couldn’t touch her. He tried; he couldn’t touch her. He couldn’t achieve any power over her. On the contrary she was very powerful."</font><br>
