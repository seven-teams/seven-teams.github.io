<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Once you start doing this Sahaja Yoga, then you recognize it's how important is Sahaja Yoga that it gives a real meaning to the whole creation. In the eyes of God and Divine Power, that has to work out. That's the purpose of life. And surprisingly it is left to your will, not to My will. I have no will, I have no action. So, it is your will which is going to work it out. So, you have to dedicate. And now, you have to weigh yourself: `How much I am willed?' The seminars help you to see how much you really will that Sahaja Yoga should be successful. This is the second point.<br>
To make it successful, what should we do? We must understand the basics of Sahaja Yoga, and try to see within ourselves: 'Do we understand the basics and do we have those qualities by which we sustain those basics?'<br>
The first basic of Sahaj Yog is: that you have to become your Spirit.<br> 
So that your body emits the power of Spirit alone. This is the first basic of Sahaj Yog.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"I had a special purpose in coming to Gaṇapatīpuḷe, apart from that, it was a very beautiful place and very relaxing for all of you. Uh the reason is: I found this place had vibrations which will clear you out very easily, first of all. But you have to desire it, really, ardently. We should have that desire, otherwise the Kuṇḍalinī may not rise. That is very important point: that you have to desire your ascent, nothing else.<br>
Is not a place you have come for holiday or just for some sort of a relaxation or for some enjoyment or sleeping or anything. But you have come here for a penance, for a tapasyā, to clear out yourself completely.<br>
<b>This is a place of Śhrī Gaṇeśha’s temple which is not very much frequented by people and is still very-very pure. And I thought that Gaṇeśh Principle will be awakened in you which is the Source of everything.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Here, as we see in Gaṇapatīpuḷe, Śhrī Gaṇeśhana ... uh <b>Gaṇeśha is in is ... Its complete, matured form</b> so that we develop also our Mahāgaṇeśha within ourselves, and our eyes become pure, powerful and divine.</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we came to Gaṇapatīpuḷe, it has a great significance, among the Aṣhṭavināyak [eight swayambhus of Śhrī Gaṇeśha]. It is the place of Mahāgaṇeśha.</b> Mahāgaṇeśha is Pīṭhadiśh [Governor of all Pīṭhas] and sitting on this Pīṭha, he looks after [protects] all the Gaṇeśha Swayambhus. He has the knowledge of all the Auṃkāras, as he has attained the Guru Tattwa [Guru Principle].<br>
If we see in the surroundings, the ocean, so beautiful and clean is washing the feet of this Gaṇapati, because the ocean represents the Guru Tattwa, and with that Guru Tattwa, he washes the feet of Śhrī Gaṇeśha and that is how it should happen with all the Sahaja Yogis. Gaṇeśha Stuti is done and then Śhrī Gaṇeśha is established and thereafter with the Mahālakṣhmī Tattwa you have to become Mahāgaṇeśhas."</font><br>

Dear All,<br>
Jai Śhrī Mātājī!<br>
To begin this year the traditional Gaṇapatīpuḷe Seminar, let's all together welcome Śhrī Mātājī with our open hearts by performing Āratī to Her and by refreshing our treasured moments we have spent worshiping Her in Gaṇapatīpuḷe.<br>
This year the Celebrations will continue until December 29 with the main Pujas on December 25 (Christmas) and 29 (Śhrī Adi Guru Dattatreya Jayanti).
Wish you all many spiritual accomplishments during the Seminar.
