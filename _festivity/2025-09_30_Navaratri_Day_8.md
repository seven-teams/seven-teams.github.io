<font color="DarkRed">"<b>But this Pūjā is to be done with full understanding, and with full recognition that it's a great fortune.</b> Even the Devas are jealous of you, all the Ṛiṣhis are jealous of you, so many people are jealous of you. The greatest advantage for you, greatest fortune. Make full use of it.<br>
And they are very simple things that can please, very simple. You know your Mother can be pleased with very, very simple things. It's like that only. It's how much heart you have put into it, is the point.<br>
I think tomorrow we should have the Pūjā, today we have understood about it. It is more to be felt and understood and realized than to be thought about. Because you'll go into thoughtless awareness. It is more source of triggering."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So today on this day of Aṣhṭamī, which is a very powerful day, <b>you assume that power within yourself that, 'I can fight all these horrible diseases within myself. And for others I will have compassion and love</b>. I will have not other.' This is the point we miss always. They think, 'Mother is giving lectures to others not to me.'<br>
And that compassion will bring forth the beauty of Sahaja Yoga."</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Sahaja Yoga is the Power of Compassion and Love of God Almighty.</b> But it's not just talk, just not giving you a lecture or a sermon, but it is actualization of the experience of this Divine Love. It is Spirit-oriented, not money-oriented, nor is power-oriented.<br> 
All the religions have failed outside because they are not Spirit-oriented. Now, of course, they are challenging us and saying all kinds of wrong things about us because they are frightened that they will be exposed.<br>
But Truth will prevail now. The time has come for Truth to prevail.<br>
It is surprising that people don't understand that Truth is Love and Compassion. If you really love somebody, you know everything about that person, that is how the Divine Love is, which knows everything about everything.<br>
It is the knowledge that you get when you fall into the Ocean of Love, an Ocean, you fall into the Love's Ocean.<br>
One has to know that Truth is what Truth is, you cannot change it, because it is absolute. You cannot transform it, you cannot sell it. You cannot pay for it. It has to be really understood that if you have to know the Truth you will know because the time has come, and that you are the human beings at the epitome of evolution."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>The Power of Compassion is the Power of God, which is the All-pervading Power</b>, which acts, which thinks, which understands, which connects, which redeems, which completely transforms you. That is what is compassion is."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"You have to see that all the negativity goes away, around us, around the universe.<br>
<b>So first we sing the praise of the Goddess; when She destroyed every negative, satanic incarnation of Mahiṣhāsura.</b><br> 
And when he was killed, all the Gods praised Her for saving them from the ... from the destruction, and that happened long, long time back -- it was ten thousand years back. So this is the praise of the Gods of that so that, whatever is the negativity, through those mantras will go away, because it surrounds us -- you see that, all of them have been there coming; from ten thousand years they have been coming. But this is the way you can throw them out of the present into their proper places."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Because to fight negativity in modern times is a very difficult task. You cannot kill anyone: if you kill somebody, then may be that such a person is a brother or a sister or something of somebody. Or such a person would be himself or herself a seeker.<br>
So best thing is to separate like a contagious disease, keep that person out, no sympathies. And get the person cured and enjoy the life, otherwise that person is not going to be helped.<br>
......<br>
<b>So to help Me out, you should not take any sides with negativity. That's how you can help Me the most. This is what it is the Navarātri, the Pūjā that I give you powers to fight the negativity. That's how you cure people.</b>"</font><br>
