<font color="DarkRed">"It's better to tell you after Realization that, "I am the Holy Ghost -- no doubt. I am the one about which Christ has talked."<br>
I have told them, I had never said this on -- from a platform and I told -- they have been telling Me, "Mother, You must say that once." I said, <b>"In America I'll declare it." So, today I declare that, "I am the Holy Ghost, I am the Holy Spirit, who has incarnated on this Earth for your Realization."</b><br>
May God bless you!"</font><br>
