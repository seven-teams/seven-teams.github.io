<font color="DarkRed">"Had a very nice Pūjā in Pune which I had to perform on the thirteenth because it is the date called <b>Akṣhaya Tṛitīya, means un-destructible [indestructible] third day of the Moon. That's actually nobody knew, but it is the Pūjā of the Kuṇḍalinī.</b> That day everybody felt very, very clear. Very clear. Pūjā was hardly for about half an hour, the real Pūjā of the Kuṇḍalinī. But everybody felt extremely clear and beautiful.<br>
So, that sort of Pūjā we should do tomorrow also, if possible, so that we'll have the feelings of Sahasrāra completely opened out because even if Sahasrāra is opened, the rest of the chakras, if they are caught up then you have problems. It's better to clear out all the chakras and then the Sahasrāra. So, tomorrow we'll do the Pūjā in that fashion and I hope it will work out very well for all of you."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we have gathered here to worship the Ādi Kuṇḍalinī and your own Kuṇḍalinī</b>, both of them because your Kuṇḍalinī is the reflection of the Ādi Kuṇḍalinī. We have understood a lot about Kuṇḍalinī and also we know that through Her awakening only, through Her ascent only, we have ascended into a very higher realm of consciousness. It’s not only that we have risen to a very higher realm of awareness but that it has granted us so many powers that, never before in the history of spirituality people had this power of awakening of Kuṇḍalinī."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So first, your vibrations must improve, to receive. If the reception is not good what's the use of any Pūjā or projection? So first of all we, sort of, prepare our instrument, or prepare our projecting instrument. That preparation is done by praying to different Deities, as we call that: a Kuṇḍalinī Pūjā. By praying to My Kuṇḍalinī you improve your reflection. Because then the vibrations from Me start flowing into yours and they awaken it. This is the projection as far as you are concerned.<br>
Once the instrument is all right, then you project outside. And now how do you project? By worshiping the Goddess as the Protector of the whole Universe, praising Her different attributes, even Her Face, Her Hands, everything has a meaning. Praising Her Powers. By saying that, by repeating that, you echo in your projection Her Powers ......"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"For a large-hearted man the whole world is the universe, the whole thing is within, the whole thing is yours. When such a heart you experience within yourself then Kuṇḍalinī just shoots off because, as you know, the Sahasrāra is the Heart chakra. No question of Sahasrāra catching if you have a large heart. And <b>to keep the Sahasrāra open – is just develop that sense, that wisdom, that: ‘Nobody’s mine, everybody belongs to God. Who is mine? Whatever God wants, let Him do.</b>’<br>
......<br>
So this is what it gives you discretion, and Love is Truth. So to this Kuṇḍalinī, which is nothing but, is the River, as yesterday they described Nirvaj, which doesn’t accept any compensation. The River of that Pure Love which has awakened us with such love, kindness, and tenderness, we should try to use that power within ourselves to be like that because our job is, She has given us Realization for the emancipation of the whole world, not only our own. So everyone has to give Realization to others otherwise their Kuṇḍalinī will settle back. Talk about Sahaja Yoga. <b>Sahaja Yoga is not part-time, it is not a side issue, it should be always with you. Wherever you get a chance you have to talk about Sahaja Yoga, you have to work it out, you have to give Realization, otherwise no use.</b><br>
May God bless you all."</font><br>
