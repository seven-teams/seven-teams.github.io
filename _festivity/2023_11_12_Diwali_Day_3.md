<font color="DarkRed">"It was to celebrate the coronation of Śhrī Rāma also, that is to say, symbolically, to celebrate the establishment of a kingdom which has a benevolent administration.<br>
......<br>
<b>So today is a special day to celebrate the Kingdom of God on Earth.</b> As we have ... used to pray, ``Thy kingdom come [......] on this earth" and it has come today on this mountain and we are here to celebrate the coming of the Kingdom of God as we have been praying for ages. And <b>the blessings of Kingdom of God is that you get drenched in joy -- joy which has no duality, like happiness and unhappiness</b>. Is an experience of Absoluteness and just that joy is sufficient, you don't want any food, you don't want to sleep, you don't mind where you are, just in joy drenched completely. There's no place for unhappiness, we have no heart for it."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"Śhrī Rāma's crowning or any other aspect of Śhrī Lakṣhmī here now becomes your own crowning, that is now you have entered into the Kingdom of God and once you are there then automatically as the citizens of God's Kingdom you are blessed and as you become the lotuses then you start spreading your fragrance all around. Now you do not keep this joy to yourself but you become generous about it and you go all out to give it to others."</b></font><br>

<font color="MediumVioletRed">"<b>Then the fifteenth day is the day when the Moon is absolutely missing from everything. Is absolute darkness, where you put these lights to suggest that: `There are lights, now let Lakṣhmī come within us.' So, there is no spot that should be left which is dark, so everywhere the Lakṣhmī resign ... resides, and give us the glory of Her blessings.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Lakṣhmī is the Goddess, is the power within us, by which we balance, lead a very balanced life, by which we are satisfied.</b><br>
Now they have made a beautiful picture of this Lakṣhmī also one should understand this power -- is a Lady, is a Mother and She stands on a lotus. Now these are all symbols which suggest that these symbols are carved out with such deep significance. She stands on a lotus. Means imagine, who can stand on a lotus? And She's a very healthy woman, very healthy woman and She stands on a lotus. It means that, that She is never putting pressure on anyone.<br>
......<br>
Then, it has got two red, <b>pink flowers in the hand, that are lotus flowers again.<br>
Now the lotus is regarded as a very holy flower in India, because it is so receptive to everything that is crude and funny.</b> First of all it is born in the mud. Just think of it, in the mud, in the filth, where the horrible smell is coming out, the lotus is born. And the one lotus gives the fragrance, the beautiful fragrance to the whole atmosphere, and kills all that's filth and everything, and covers the whole pond with its big, big leaves so that it looks a beautiful pond. That's what is the lotus for.<br>
But this lotus is a pink lotus, means pink, you know, is the sign of love. <b>Pink is the sign of love. So such a person has to have tremendous love and that softness of the lotus.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"For <b>your good luck, you should say let us say for your good luck, saubhāgya, for your good luck</b>. Is given to the ladies, always given to the ladies. Because in India the women are regarded as the śhakti and women who lead a married life and who have been mothers, who have been daughters and also wives and things like that are respected very much as only it is believed that <b>only the respectable women when they exist in any country the Gods also reside there. If they are not respectable the Gods don't reside there</b>."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Am-ṛu-ta. <b>Amṛuta means the thing that does not die. If in this world the Lakṣhmī exists as your wealth.</b><br>
Now the wealth that does not die, which is that wealth? Is the Spirit. So, the Grace of the Spirit is the Amṛuta Lakṣhmī. Grace of the Spirit is the Amṛuta Lakṣhmī. The rest of the things all will die out. And whatever is done through the Spirit, to please the Spirit, is the Amṛuta Lakṣhmī.<br>
For example: loving others. Loving others has a different meaning in the symbolic way as you people understand this thing. Loving means giving. Doing without any expectation: just doing it, and enjoying.<br>
The greatest is giving vibration[s]. That is Amṛuta: vibrations do not die. That's the Lakṣhmī: they are giving Amṛut."</font><br>
