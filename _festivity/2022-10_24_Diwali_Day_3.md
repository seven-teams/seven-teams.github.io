<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is a great day of Diwālī.</b> That means today is the great day of [unclear putting up] lights of your heart together to make a greater light for the world to move in a proper direction. It’s a day of great joy, and those who join in this, are spreading also great joy. But the problems are there, as they say, but for us, there is no problem because there is no darkness, we don’t see any darkness anywhere, we see lights, and lights, and lights.
Then what is the thing missing, missing is our sincerity. We have to be very sincere with ourselves because it is not just a borrowed love or a borrowed joy, but it is from within the source, it’s flowing, flowing, and flowing. So that is to be awakened, and that love should flow, and our small petty things like jealousies and competitions and all those things which spoil us must be washed away. And it can be washed if your heart is full of love.<br>
Today is a day of spreading love, light of love so that everybody feels enlightened and happy and forgets these petty problems."</font><br>

Then the fifteenth day is the day when the Moon is absolutely missing from everything.</b> Is absolute darkness, where you put these lights to suggest that: `There are lights, now let Lakṣhmī come within us.' So, there is no spot that should be left which is dark, <b>so everywhere the Lakṣhmī resign ... resides, and give us the glory of Her blessings.</b>' "</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Śhrī Lakṣhmī is the Goddess of well-being and wealth. She is the wife of Śhrī Viṣhṇu and the mother of Kāma, the God of Love.<br>
She is also called Myriam, because She was born from the ocean, which is the very source of wealth.</b> Even if human beings impoverish more and more the Mother Earth, taking from her all her raw materials, she still gives infinitely more resources.<br>
Śhrī Lakṣhmī is standing on a lotus. <b>Her right hand protects and Her left hand gives blessings.</b> She incarnates the wealth but also the glory of wealth. It is the first opening to our spiritual search. We first look for material wealth, but soon we understand that we need something else to reach the complete bliss. "</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Then the fifteenth is that darkest night. That's the darkest night when there is no Moon. Absolutely that's the day when they celebrate this Diwālī.</b> But symbolically, in India also, Śhrī Rāma returned to Dvārika ... to this place on that day, and was crowned on that day. So the significance of Diwālī is expressed in this manner: that this is the day when Narakāsura [Tārakāsura] was on doubt the martyric, they have all gone to Narak, they have gone to the Hell, and the people now are safe from them and they are celebrating the joy, this thing.<br>
And that is the time when Christ was born. That's why lights are being put in the night, 'cause He was born at twelve o'clock in the night.</b></font><br>

</p>

<p>Śhrī Rāma's crowning or any other aspect of Śhrī Lakṣhmī here now becomes your own crowning, that is now you have entered into the Kingdom of God and once you are there then automatically as the citizens of God's Kingdom you are blessed and as you become the lotuses then you start spreading your fragrance all around. Now you do not keep this joy to yourself but you become generous about it and you go all out to give it to others. Generosity at another level, at a lower level is transformed into this Universal Love. Whatever you gain, whatever joy, satisfaction, vibrations, knowledge, all that you want to give it to others. You want to spread it because now you got the reality and you don't want to keep it to yourself, you think it is very important that everyone in the world should know about reality.<br>
This is significant in putting these lights, that now you are the lights. It is the darkest night today, tonight is the darkest night, in the same way these are the darkest days, this is the Kali Yuga and it is the core Kali Yuga, the worst time where the worst things are happening, human beings are going to the worst level and at this time we have to put Sahaja Yoga before them. You know what is the ordeal one has to go through to break the hard nuts of the brains of people, but it is working, it has clicked already. ......<br>
Now you have to enlighten many lights, we call it Dīpawali, Diwālī is dīpāwali, means the rows of lights, and by celebrating this Diwālī with so many of you I'm sure we'll have such a torch of light which will go around the whole world. Just remember you are not a small drop, now you have become the Ocean and you have to spread. Now you are sitting on your thrones and assume your powers. You have all the powers within you, you have to just manifest it."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Such a beautiful lotus, I am sitting in a beautiful lotus.
 In the same way, is reflected in your heart as a beautiful lotus.</b> Feel that lotus, how beautiful, how delicate. 
It’s pink because pink is the lotus which invites everyone, a sign of generosity, of invitation. Pink color attracts all kinds of insects, everybody.<br>
So lotus is pink and it invites everything, open to everything, not frightened of everything.  
You can make people see what a spiritual person is. <b>You are the reflector of Sahaja Yoga, not Me. You have to reflect Sahaj Yoga.<br>
For such people are always in joy and wisdom.</b>"</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Lakṣhmī is the Goddess, is the power within us, by which we balance, lead a very balanced life, by which we are satisfied.</b><br>
Now they have made a beautiful picture of this Lakṣhmī also one should understand this power -- is a Lady, is a Mother and She stands on a lotus. Now these are all symbols which suggest that these symbols are carved out with such deep significance. She stands on a lotus. Means imagine, who can stand on a lotus? And She's a very healthy woman, very healthy woman and She stands on a lotus. It means that, that She is never putting pressure on anyone.<br>
......<br>
Then, it has got two red, pink flowers in the hand, that are lotus flowers again. Now the lotus is regarded as a very holy flower in India, because it is so receptive to everything that is crude and funny. First of all it is born in the mud. Just think of it, in the mud, in the filth, where the horrible smell is coming out, the lotus is born. And the one lotus gives the fragrance, the beautiful fragrance to the whole atmosphere, and kills all that's filth and everything, and covers the whole pond with its big, big leaves so that it looks a beautiful pond. That's what is the lotus for. But this lotus is a pink lotus, means pink, you know, is the sign of love. <b>Pink is the sign of love. So such a person has to have tremendous love and that softness of the lotus.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>You know that today is the Pūjā of Śhrī Lakṣhmī.</b> Here nobody performs Lakṣhmī Pūjā. So, it must be understood that today is a very important day. <b>Lakṣhmī gives you everything. She is Mother. She gives everything, all blessings, all comfort, and most important is that She enlightens your inner being.</b><br>
So somehow you recognize Lakṣhmī. Lakṣhmī doesn’t mean money. You have to understand that She is a Goddess, and you have to respect money like a Goddess. In our country, people do a lot for the sake of money; wrong things that are very bad. But you have got a responsibility to recognize Lakṣhmī as Devī, and worship Her and understand that you cannot make fun of Lakṣhmī. Lakṣhmī blesses you and will go on blessing you. Such evil people are a few only, and you should be contented that Lakṣhmī resides in your being and has accumulated many moments of joy and comfort for you. You are going to get all that and have already got it.<br>
...... I am sure that everyone will worship Lakṣhmī, and in the Lakṣhmī Pūjā, one should understand all forms of Lakṣhmī and what Her nature is. We cannot understand Her, and if we cannot understand Her, we will follow the wrong path. So it should be understood that She is Devī and that She is your Mother, and that She can do anything for you because She is very powerful and very affectionate, She doesn’t give you any problem.<br>
If you get trapped somewhere, She will save you. Such is the blessing of Lakṣhmī."</font><br>
