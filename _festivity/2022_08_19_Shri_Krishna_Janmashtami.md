<font color="DarkRed">"Today we are celebrating here in this holy land the birthday of Shrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br>
Shrī Kṛiṣhṇa is the ultimate of the fatherhood, that I described you before, who came on this Earth and illustrated the ultimate of that. So on this Earth, the highest fatherhood is Shrī Kṛiṣhṇa’s awareness.<br>
But in the Kingdom of God, we can say in Heavens, or even above everything else, resides Sadāshiva who does not take incarnations. He is one of the aspects, Shrī Kṛiṣhṇa is one of the aspects of Sadāshiva which is the Father. And the Ādi Shakti or the Holy Ghost is the other aspect of Sadāshiva which is His power. So when Shrī Kṛiṣhṇa incarnated on this Earth, an aspect of this Ādi Shakti came on this Earth as Rādhā."</font><br>

<font color="blue">You are the Father, yet You are the friend.<br>
You are the revelation of Ultimate Fatherhood.<br>
You manifest Śhrī Sadāśhiva (Lord God Almighty).<br>
Ādi Śhakti's Creation is for Your play.<br>
You are the integrated brain of Divinity.</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"But one has to realize that the message of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was to surrender.<br>
Now the surrendering that we think in the gross way is like an enemy surrenders to another enemy. So, when the word surrender is spoken, we build up our barriers by thinking that, 'Now, we have to surrender, leave something to the other party.'<br>
But when Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa talked about surrender, He was saying that, 'Surrender your enemies to Me so that I will get rid of them.'<br>
Now, the worst enemy that we have is our ego. And with ego starts all kinds of other problems, because it is the biggest barrier for our growth. And the ego starts, as you know, from the Viśhuddhi chakra and can be sucked into Viśhuddhi chakra away. Now let us see how this Viśhuddhi chakra made is. All the vowels that we use come from Viśhuddhi chakra."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"With the understanding that today is the day -- in the night about twelve o'clock, now it must be about twelve o'clock in India also, about that, so it matches -- He was born at this time in the night, because it was real night symbolically, under horrible circumstances He came. At a time then, when His own birth was very dangerously placed, He was saved, and then in His very childhood He killed rākṣhasas. But all this He did because He was an Incarnation."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"What fruits you have, Śhasyaśhyāmalāṃ [part of line 4 of `Vande Mātaram']. Beautiful country you have, is Gokul itself, Vṛindāvan itself. I'm very happy I could come again. This is the first time that, Janmāṣhṭamī, I'm here first time. And today I'm wearing a sāṛī that Rādhā used to wear this kind, is all hand and dyed, is made with tying up every knot, thousands of knots like the thousand chakras. And what is our brain? Is nothing but Virāṭa itself. Brain is the place of Virāṭa, so the whole central nervous system is guided by this brain and the brains of the universe is America."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"They had to work together many a times, and with the Principle of Viṣhṇu, the Principle of Mahālakṣhmī has acted to help the ascent of the people. So the Principle of Viṣhṇu is for your ascent, for the evolutionary process of human beings. Through this Advent and through the Power of Mahālakṣhmī, we have become human beings from amoeba stage.<br>
This is a spontaneous working for us, but for the Principle of Viṣhṇu, He had to go through various Incarnations to evolve. As you know there have been <b>Incarnations of Śhrī Viṣhṇu as a fish to begin with and went on till it came to the state of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, where they say that He has become complete</b>."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"To overcome all kinds of nonsense of religion, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa’s Advent was there. Is a very important Advent, but I don’t know how many people understand that. He came to show that it’s all Līlā, is all the Play of God. What is there to be serious? What is there to be ritualistic? You cannot bind God in any rituals. That’s why He came on this Earth, to tell you that you should not try to bind yourself by rituals which are nonsensical. This was His teaching soo many years back, He taught this six thousand year back, but still, if you-you see, in every religion there are so many rituals going on.<br>
So when the Incarnations died, people started rituals, funny stuff."</font><br>
