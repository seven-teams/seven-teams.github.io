<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is the eighth day of Navarātri, but it is great day for Sahaja Yogis because it is the most important period.</b> That is, the seventh center we have crossed and we are on the eighth center. We need not think of the Goddess what She did on the eighth day, we have to think today what we have to do within ourselves.<br>
After crossing the seventh day, after crossing the seventh chakra -- that is the real ascent in your spiritual ascent. What are we to do on the eighth one?<br>
It's so Sahaja that today should be Aṣhṭamī, because that is the day the Goddess killed so may evil doers, and demons and rākṣhasas. She did it on Her own, alone. Now these evil forces are manifesting in human beings. They have spread out. They are within us. So we all have to fight those forces within us. The war is within ourselves, is not without. First when you ascend the seventh chakra, when you are on the eighth step, you have to remember first you have to fight those forces within ourselves."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"...... today we do, is a very great Pūjā of Aṣhṭamī [eighth day]: is the day when the Goddess killed nine rākṣhasas together with Her eight hands. <b>So today is a very special day for which a very special attention is needed.<br>
It's only at the behest of the bhaktas that the Goddess took Her form and killed all these rākṣhasas.<br>
Also with Her eight hands, She killed Mahiṣhāsura.</b> That's why She's called as Mahiṣhāsuramardinī.<br> 
She's called as Nava Chaṇḍī, one who has killed nine chaṇḍas, means nine rākṣhasas She has killed.<br> 
So is a very important day and very vital and very deep."</font><br>

So this is the praise of the Gods of that so that, whatever is the negativity, through those mantras will go away, because it surrounds us -- you see that, all of them have been there coming; from ten thousand years they have been coming.

<font color="DarkRed">"Now you want to give Me a sāṛī. In Marathi it is called as 'pot zakaych', means they're covering the womb of the Goddess, the stomach of the Mother. 'Because She's put us there, She has given us birth, so we must give Her something to cover it,' is a very humble way of saying it. Now you give Me a sāṛī -- I don't know when I'm going to wear all these, but whatever it is -- just give Me a sāṛī with a feeling, and maybe I may never wear it, I may wear it also. <b>But the progeny will see what you have given to your Mother. I'm not going to carry it with Me, nobody's going to carry the matter with them. But it had a purpose, it had a meaning, it had emotions behind it. It was given in a Pūjā when so many people gathered, you gave to your Mother.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"We have to today understand that, 'Why do we do Devī Pūjā? What is the reason for this Devī Pūjā? What do we get out of it? What are we supposed to achieve in our contents within ourselves?'<br>
The first thing is that Kuṇḍalinī is the Devī. She's the reflection of the Ādi Śhakti. So when you worship Devī, first you worship also your own Kuṇḍalinī by giving Her credit because She has given you this Realization. It's much deeper understanding than normally people have about the Devī Pūjā because they are not realized Souls. Their Kuṇḍalinī not is awakened. <b>So normally when they do Devī Pūjā it's for the purpose of getting Realization so that the Devī should be pleased -- prasanna -- and should give them Realization, or must get our chance to get to somebody who will give them Realization.</b> But you are at a different level now. So it's more of a thanksgiving to your own Kuṇḍalinī and to Ādi Śhakti, glorifying that whatever has happened so miraculously is because of the Kuṇḍalinī which was within you, which was reflected by the Ādi Śhakti.<br>
But one has to know that only we are realized Souls is not the point, only that we can feel the vibrations is not the point, that we can give Realizations to other is also not the point. Then what is it? Very important -- it's the content within us. What do we have within us is the point. These are all the expressions of what we have within."</font><br>
