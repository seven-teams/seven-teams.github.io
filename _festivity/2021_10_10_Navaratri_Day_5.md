<font color="DarkRed">"But many universes have been created by Ādi Śhakti, even before us. And She has tried many other things also. Ultimately She has tried this: She has created Earth and then created us. Now how She has done that we’ll see later on. Just now let us see how She assumes Her ... Her Power.<br>
<b>When She decides to create, She is endowed with Three Powers: She has Three Powers of God which are granted to Her.</b> By one power, first of all, is the existence, the desire to exist, She desires to exist with God. The second power is to create and the third power is to sustain. First power is existence, second is to create and the third is the evolving power or sustainance [sustenance] power by which gradually you sustain something and you become something. These are the Three Powers She assumes. In short, we can say that <b>She forms Three Powers of Mahākālī, Mahāsaraswatī, and Mahālakṣhmī. These are the Three Powers She assumes within Herself</b>."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Navarātri is like a Mother’s Day where you give thanksgiving to Her:<br>
which was just relentless, continuous working for Her children."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>You see God’s creation.</b> He has created you and He’s not the one who is going to destroy His own creation. You don’t do anything. You just don’t do anything.<br>
You see, this is the wrong impression human beings have got. What they do is a dead work. Now see, the flowers are dead so you have arranged them. The tree is dead so you have made the furniture, that is all.<br>
Dead to the dead. Any living work can you do? Any living work? Nothing. Only after Realization, you can do it, by awakening the Kuṇḍalinī. Then you can do it. Then you are entitled to become the master."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Mahāsaraswatī made the Antarikṣh [Universe, space] first.</b> In this, the earth element is special. The Earth is placed in between the Sun and the Moon so that all kinds of a living organism can grow there easily. From this living organism gradually evolved human beings.<br>
But we should know our own great power. That power is what we call creation power, it’s also called creativity. <b>This creation power is the blessing of Saraswatī by which many arts have been generated. The evolution of art is due to the blessings of Saraswatī.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"You come up now to the Heart chakra. Heart chakra is divided into three parts. In the center of the Heart chakra resides Jagadambā Herself. But [in] the left side as I have told you resides Śhiva and His Power is Pārvatī. <b>When Pārvatī Herself separates Her identity with Her Lord and enters in the center to save Her children from the domination of the evil spirits, then She resides in the center and She is the Jagadambā. This is called as “Sacred Heart” in the Bible. She resides as Jagadambā. She has taken many Incarnations to save.<br>
Today there was Lalitā Pañchamī, they sang the song of Lalitā. The way She took Her Incarnations to fight the evil forces, to save the bhaktas from the domination of satanic and depraving personalities. She is there within you also, if not awakened She can be awakened. She is all the time there to save you from those satanic forces.</b>"</font><br>

I meditate on the incomparable Śhrī Mahāsaraswatī who holds in Her Eight Lotus-like Hands<br>
the Bell, Trident, Plough, Conch, Mace, Discus, Bow and Arrow; who is<br>
Effulgent as the Destroyer of Śhumbha and other Asuras, who issued forth from<br>
Pārvatī's body and is the Substratum of the Three Worlds.<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"If there is the Father and the Son there has to be a Mother. Because of that, the whole time the motherhood has not been respected. <b>But Mother is the power behind every creation.</b><br>
......<br>
So like this instrument has to be connected to the mains, you are also to be connected to the mains. As ... as this instrument has no meaning without this connection, we have no meaning without our connection to the Divine Power. <b>So it is a myth if you go on taking the name of God and calling Him and nothing works out because you are not connected.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="Sienna">"This song that you have heard has been composed in the year of 1600. And in this song the poet has sung for the rustic people, in their language. That, “Oh Mother, give us our Realization!” Jogawa means the Yoga, the Union with the Divine and the Sahaja Yoga means spontaneous. It fills My heart to see how since long the seekers have been asking for this Union with the Divine. What a search! What a seeking!"</font><br>
