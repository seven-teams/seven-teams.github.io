<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we have assembled here to do Pūjā to Buddha.</b>
As you know Buddha was a son of a king. And one day He was shocked to see a very poor man, thin man, walking on the street, very unhappy person, and He felt very sad about it. Then He saw one person who was very sick and about to die. Then He saw a man who was dead and people were carrying him to the cremation ground. This all upset Him very much and He started thinking about it and seeking what is the reason for all these happenings in human beings. Firstly, why do they become so miserable or sick, or, why do they die so miserably? The reason He found out in His search. He went round the whole world,
I should say, in the sense: He read Upaniṣhads, He read ... went to many gurus, went to many places of spiritual education, Benares, everywhere He went. And ultimately, He was sitting under a banyan tree when suddenly His Kuṇḍalinī was awakened by Ādi Śhakti and He got His Realization. Then He realized that the reason for all this is the desire.
<b>In Sahaja Yoga, we have now understood that all other desires are not pure desires. Firstly, whatever desires are fulfilled, we are not satisfied by it, first thing. And secondly, all these desires have a repercussion.</b> So what is the pure desire? That, you all know, is the Kuṇḍalinī. <b>Kuṇḍalinī is the power of pure desire, which fulfills your pure desire to be the Spirit, to be Buddha, to be enlightened. Buddha means a person who is enlightened.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"The Pūjā to Shrī Buddha is being performed<br>
today to open this chakra.<br>
At the level of the Āgñyā chakra there are thoughts. Because you are all<br>
connected with the same Divine Force there can be no difference of opinion."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today we have decided to celebrate the Buddha Jayanti, it’s the day of Buddha’s birthday. In the whole map of time, Buddha came to this Earth at a time when it was so important for Him to come. That time, especially in India, we had two types of people: one, who were very ritualistic, trying to be extremely strict and disciplined; and the another were the people who were too much conditioned and were full of so-called devotion to God. So these two types of people were occupying the area of seekers. So it was necessary to neutralize these two styles of seekings."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Buddha was one of the very Great Incarnations in the sense that He was the son, one of the sons of Rāma who incarnated on this earth, Buddha, to occupy the highest life on this earth. So He had to take saṃnyāsa because without that He could not show that. But there was no need for anybody else to take saṃnyāsa. But in His case mistakes, I mean, why there were some mistakes about things, because when He tried all these tricks of saṃnyāsa, going here and there He never realized that this is all not needed.<br>
He was so tired and fagged out, that suddenly, spontaneous, the Primordial Mother Herself gave Him the Realization because He was so tired."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today’s Pūjā is very important because I feel Western countries have gone off with their ego, and they need Buddha very much, and they like also this so-called Buddhism very much, because you see, they can then just hide behind that camouflage. “We are Buddhist, you see.” They’ll worry about Afghanistan and they’ll worry about lama. They’ll worry about all other people, because, “You see, we are Buddhist.” But there’s no truth in it, no truth.<br>
Sahaja Yogis have to establish that truth, that dedication.<br>
So Buddha has said: “Buddham śharaṇaṃ gacchāmi.” “I bow to all those who are realized Souls.” “Dhammam śharaṇaṃ gacchāmi.” “I bow myself, to my dharma,” that is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma. And then lastly is: “Saṅghaṃ śharaṇaṃ gacchāmi.” “I bow to collectivity.” "</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>When you say, “Mother, we surrender to You,” that just means that you give that horrible ego a complete holiday</b>, it means that. That is how this ego disappears. I think all your, your ... just now, your Agnyas are opened out, most of you, somehow. And then you’ll laugh at everything; you’ll make fun of yourself; just enjoy everything.<br>
<b>May God bless you.</b>"</font><br>
