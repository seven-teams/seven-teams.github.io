<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is a special day, as you know: we are worshi-pring [worshiping] the Goddess, who came on this Earth nine times before, to kill all the demons and all the negativity, and relieve all the bhaktas to worship Her.</b><br> 
All Her work has ... is already been described.<br>
Despite that, they find new type of devils, new type of negative people, have come back. Perhaps it had to be.<br>
......<br>
This had to be! Maybe, after all eh is Kali Yuga, and the drama of Kali Yuga would not be performed unless and until they are there. So-o, to complete this drama, they came.<br>
But this time is going to be a very different type of war: is going to be the war of the peaceful people.<br>
And the peaceful people are the most successful people in every walk of life, even in the war.<br>
It did not work out before."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"And that is why, <b>today is the day when the Virgin, Gaurī, sat down to worship Śhiva</b>. She made a Śhiva Lingua and was sitting and <b>putting Her sindūr on that: "That you look after this, which is the mark of my Union with you. I leave it to you, to look after" -- to Śhiva. "You look after me. I surrender to you." With this, that's how Gaurī your Kuṇḍalinī surrenders to the Spirit: 'Now You look after this connection.</b> I forget everything else. I leave it into Your hands. Lift Me up. You raise Me up. I forget all that was Me before. Everything I have dropped out. No other desire. But just lift Me higher and higher. Make Me Yourself. The rest of it is not important. All other manifestations of this, desires are over. Now, I am absolutely surrendered to You, My Spirit. Lift Me higher and higher. Higher and higher, away from all the things that were not the Spirit. Make Me complete Spirit, full Spirit.'</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>The Devī incarnated on this Earth to kill the demonic personalities who try to destroy all the good qualities of women.<br>
We also have those demonic personalities within us and they are to be destroyed -- not physically, but mentally.</b><br>
How you accept them and how you deal with whatever they try is very surprising.<br>
You must understand that the goodness of a person is very important. If you are trying to be nasty or dominating then you'll be definitely destroyed. That's why this Devī has come on the Earth. <b>That is the assurance of this Devī, the Goddess.</b>"</font><br>

<p style=" text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"But Goddess Herself has done so many things for us already, within us, though we are not aware of it. Is said that, <b>"Yā Devī sarvabhūteśhu"</b>: "All those whom You have created," means mostly the human beings, "What do You do? As what do You exist inside the human beings?"<br>
Now, just introspect if you have these qualities within you or not, because they are given to you by the Goddess, by the Śhakti within you."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Now one has to think, 'Why such an importance is paid to a Virgin? Why a Virgin is respected ... to that extent? What are the Powers of a Virgin?' That She can bear a child of that magnitude that was Christ, that She could create Śhrī Gaṇeśha out of Her own body, that She could protect innocent, dynamic force of Her children who are egoless, who have not known what is ego.<br>
So this Great Power and Force resides in a person who has lots of puru [many, abundant] puṇyas, who has done lots of good things in previous lives, who has always understood that <b>Virginity is a power higher than any other power and would save the Virginity and Chastity with all Her effort and care.<br>
As you know that, within our body, She is placed as Kuṇḍalinī.</b> [It] means She is the Virgin. She is untouched. <b>The desire to become Spirit is without any blemish: nirmala. There is no blemish. I[t]s waiting is pure.</b> There's no other desire, but to be one with the Divine. All other desi... desires are finished.<br>
It's a very difficult subject for Me to talk about in the Western country. It's embarrassing. I do not want any one of you, whether men or women, to develop any guilt in your mind. Because that is one thing is the greatest blemish as you know, at a later stage this guilt works in the opposite direction. It is of no help. <b>But when we understand that we have these problems, we have to be humble about it. Not guilty but humble.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>You must pray to God and ask what you want.<br>
Ask for, 'Complete satisfaction in my heart, joy in my heart, bliss in my heart, so that the whole world becomes blissful.
