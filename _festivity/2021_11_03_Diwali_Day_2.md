<font color="DarkRed">"It’s a very, very great day today, I should say, where the evil has been suppressed. Their evil that spreads its power all over is only because of two factors. One is that you are not knowledgeable, you are still blind, and you follow things which are not right but you think are powerful.<br>
This illusion creates not only problems but absolute destruction.<br>
Now we’re going, coming to Sahaja Yoga: you know all the knowledge, where is s-subtle knowledge, very subtle. Is not superficial knowledge. It is very subtle. And because they don’t know this subtle knowledge, they fall into the wrong path of, I should say ignorance, and then they try to oppose the people who are doing good.<br>
<b>But above all is the Power of God. All this drama is played to prove the existence of that Great Power. It has all worked out so well. And for all of you, Sahaja Yogis, it’s a very great achievement that you can see the play. Many people who have achieved so-called success cannot see that point, but you can see it because you are spectators.</b> Though all the world is a part and parcel of that drama, you are outside and you can see it so clearly."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>On this day of Diwālī, I want to tell you all that the meaning of Diwālī is that the Hell is full of darkness and you all are enlightened.</b> You are expected to fight wherever there is darkness and let them know that they are wrong deeds. By doing this our country will improve and you have to do this. We have been performing Pūjās and rituals but the Śhakti [Divine Power] which is there within us, is there to oppose all that is not truthful. Many people do not know that making money is a sickness. They will go straight to Hell. I am telling you all this because no one has said it like this before. <b>On the day of Diwālī, I am telling you that we are going to light lamps and celebrate happiness in our hearts.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So there are so many aspects for this that, after Rāma had killed Rāvaṇa, another satanic force, this Diwālī was celebrated. Also, this was celebrated much earlier, when Narakāsura was killed.<br>
And this is how we express our joy and happiness, our gratitude to God that He has protected us always with His Power, with His Śhakti and has destroyed all the rākṣhasas and all the evil forces of this world.<br>
<b>This is the time of Thanksgiving. On this day we have to go to our elders and give thanks to them for whatever they have done for us. To all those people whom we have to give thanks, today is the day when we have to ask God to bless all these people.<br>
For us also, to be very jubilant, I am very happy, is a day because now I feel from tomorrow Sahaja Yoga is going to take new strides.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So what do we do to remove the darkness of the night is to put lights. In the same way, people should be enlightened.<br> 
There should be light in the heart of people. Once they’re enlightened, this darkness from which we are suffering because of our ignorance will be finished and we’ll have the Absolute Knowledge.<br>
So this is a new age that they are talking about is here right now, here, that it is going to work out in such a manner that it will be all enlightened personalities together, and they’ll know what is light is, what is Real Knowledge, Gyāna.<br>
So ours is a Path of Knowledge: Knowledge that is Love, Knowledge that is Compassion. This is what we have to understand, that we have come into another area, arena, where all the skirmishes and the troubles of Kali Yuga cannot enter.<br>
...... <b>With the darkness in the heart, darkness in the mind that you don’t know where are you, what are you doing, and what you should be doing, just like going amok you go on hitting each other. This is what is Kali Yuga, and the one who recognizes it and gets out of it is the Sahaja Yogi.</b> Otherwise, you are just like other people if you are still indulging into the same periphery, in the same circles of imbalance.<br>
...... So <b>you are all enlightened souls. For Me, that’s the Diwālī. If the people are enlightened that’s the Diwālī: that they remove all the darkness of Kali Yuga and you all enjoy the beauty and joy of Kali Yuga. It’s very, very symbolic I should say, that Diwālī has already started. We have many lights, and we have to get more lights – not because it is short of light; why are we taking more lights, why do you want? Because all must be saved.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Sahaja Yogi is a special character of a soldier who fights for the Truth.<br>

In this Diwālī Day, I bless you all from My heart and I want you to respect yourself and understand what is the position of your being in this l... something ... organization we can call or a, in this Movement of Sahaja Yoga, and how are we working it out.<br> 
The attention should move from all this nonsensical, mundane things to your Self.<br>
It should be a very dynamic force that should work out. And I am sure next year it will be very different.<br>
We’ll have all the beautiful blessings of the Divine. We must do it collectively, understandingly.<br>
May God bless you!"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Then the fourteenth day is very important, because that is the day the Goddess as a power, as a power, because it was Kārttikeya who killed Narakāsura, the devil.</b><br>
And he was one of the worst of all, could not be killed.<br>
So Śhiva and Pārvatī were married for this special purpose to produce this powerful Śhakti Putra, means the Son of the Śhakti, known as Kārttikeya.<br>
And He was just born to kill this horrible devil, called as Narakāsura. And He killed.<br>
<b>That is the day, fourteenth day. It is something like Halloween, that day.</b><br>
<b>Because that is the day they opened the gates of hell and put all the devils into Hell.</b><br> 
And that’s why that day one has to rest in the morning time as long as possible. So that let all the devils be put in nicely because some of them might be hanging around still.<br>
It’s better to allow them to get out. I mean in the realm that you are you do not feel much their existence.<br>
But if you were in the realm of subconscious area or Collective Subconscious, people see even some of the spirits and also can feel their existence, they see the black spots and all that.<br>
So that day is very dangerous, but because Narakāsura was killed, people celebrated.<br>
That celebration is expressed next day, which that day is the day of Diwālī they say."</font><br>
