<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is the birthday of Śhrī Guru Nāṇaka.</b> It is being celebrated throughout the world with so much of zeal that I have not seen in India. For the first time, it has been advertised in so many papers and by different means.<br>
Guru Nāṇaka always talked of Sahaja Yoga. “Everything else,” He said, “is just showing off.” About religion, He said that “Observing fasts, going on pilgrimage, etc., are just meant to show off. Now you have to discover the power that is within you and establish it.” Guru Nāṇaka kept on repeating the same thing again and again.<br>
...... Guru Nāṇaka always talked of the Spirit. He explained it very clearly, but no one heeded what he wrote. They will just put a finger on the couplet and read it out. Could we understand him this way? If we go through his writings properly and absorb it, then the whole śhabda jālam [web of words], in which most of the people are caught, will come to an end. See the condition of Sikhs! Without looking within and experiencing the innate energy, how could one follow Sikh religion? Only this is the teaching of Guru Nāṇaka, this is what is called ‘Sikh’ [learning]. All the Saints of that age had the discretion to know who is a Saint and who is not. All the gurus incorporated their poems and experiences in Guru Grantha and that is why Guru Grantha is revered so much. Only the renowned gurus contributed to it. They were so spiritual that they did churning of all the religious Scriptures and put the substance in Guru Grantha.
That is what we do in Sahaja Yoga. <b>We do not follow any particular Saint or Incarnation; we respect all of them and strike a balance.</b></font><br>

There is One and only One God who is transcendent as well as immanent.<br>
True and Eternal Name. Creator and Person. Without Fear and without Enmity.<br>
Timeless Form, Unborn, Self-existent.<br>
Realized by Divine Grace.<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today is a special day of Guru Nāṇaka’s birthday.<br>
Uh, we have celebrated one Guru Pūjā uh-uh-uh ... and the, as you know that Guru Nāṇak was also the Incarnation of the Primordial Master, the same Spirit came on this Earth. And He’s the One who tried to re-establish the work of Muhammad.
Muhammad was the Incarnation of the same Spirit, the Primordial Master. He came on this Earth to establish the religion.<br>
We all belong to One Religion which believes in expanding our ourne ... awareness to the new perception of collectivity: from human level to the higher level, where you can perceive and manifest the Divine Power. This is the religion we are following.<br>
<b>All the religions were established on this Earth to create the seekers. You are the seekers: you are the Men of God. Now, all of you have to become Prophets. And to become Prophets, today’s Sahaja Yoga has taken the form of Mahā Yoga. All of you have to become Prophets.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen"><b>"May God bless you all, this day, in the name of Nāṇaka<br> 
I bless you all with that great spirit of mastery,<br>
which you all should become – the Great Prophets who are going to change all the men of God into Prophets.<br>
May God bless you!"</b></font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"You have to educate yourself spiritually and Guru Nāṇaka prophesized just like William Blake that the Men of God are going to come during Kali Yuga, and there will be many Prophets who will be transforming Prophets, who will be transforming people into Prophet State – He had prophesized. They have all prophesized about you. Now you have to prophesize about those who are going to be Prophets."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Guru Nāṇak was not a human being, He was not only a Paigambar [Prophet] but He was the Reincarnation of Ādi Guru, the Primordial Master, He was a Divine Personality. Of course, the people who were there at His time were so useless and gross people that they actually tortured His life and nobody followed Him. After His death is a different point. He also has said that it is the Primordial Mother who has created the Universe."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Is a great thing we are worshiping today Guru Nāṇaka, that's Me, that may you become Great Guru Nāṇakas.<br> 
All of Them were created by Ādi Śhakti.<br>
 All these Gurus were created by Her.</b><br> 
And today I say that you all become as great as Guru Nāṇaka, as great as Moses, as great as Sāī Nāth, as great as Nāṇaka, Janaka, Muhammad.<br> 
All [of you] have to become as great as all these Great Incarnations.<br>
Just desire, have earnestness in you and alertness to achieve it."</font><br>

He who looketh not in wandering to tombs<br>

Or sitting in a posture of meditation;<br>
Religion consisteth not in wandering foreign countries<br>

Abide pure amidst the impurities of the world."</b></font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Guru Nāṇak Dev</b> has imagined the entire universe decorated as a prayer-platter on the altar of the Almighty. The starting verses of the Āratī are as follows:<br>
<font color="DarkGreen"><b>Gagan mein thaal, rav chand deepak bane, taarka mandal janak moti dhūp malay aan lao, pawan chavro kare sagal ban rāi phulant jyoti kaisi Āratī hoye, bhavkhandana teri Āratī.<br>
Anhat sabad bajant bheri kaisi Āratī hoye, bhavkhandana teri Āratī.</b></font><br>
Means: The sky is the prayer-platter, the sun and the moon are the lamps, the stars and the constellations are the pearls and jewels. The air coming from the sandalladen Malay mountain are the incense, air is the fan, entire flora of the Earth are the flowers ...... oh ...... what an Āratī is it! O destroyer of fear!</font>
