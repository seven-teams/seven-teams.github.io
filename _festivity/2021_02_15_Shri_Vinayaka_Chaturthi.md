<font color="DarkRed">"Only thing you should know that there is a Power All-pervading which exists all around, which thinks, which understands which coordinates. We do nothing. Human beings have this ego for nothing at all. They really don't do anything. For example, what do we do is to making a chair. Just a tree is there. We make it into a chair -- a dead into a dead. Any living thing do we do? Can we transform a flower into a tree? You can't. Billions and billions of such things are done every moment on this Earth and is done through this Divine Power of God. We have to feel that, we have to become that. <b>We have to be instrumental. God has specially made this instrument in such a way that ultimately you get connected to the whole. Once you get connected you start feeling your working on collectivity.</b> Your awareness becomes different and from your hand Cool Breeze starts flowing and energy starts flowing. And you can feel another person through this Cool Breeze. You can feel it, what centers there are catching. You can see on the hands we have shown. When these centers are enlightened how these sympathetic centers on our hands, you can feel it and you can find out what's the matter with another person. What center is catching, where is the problem, what we have to do. It's an integration of a person, completely because these, all the centers represent our different beings. When the Kuṇḍalinī passes through them, She pierces through them just like a thread through many pearls and integrates. But when She enters through this path, then she enters into this awareness, this dynamic awareness of which we become an instrument, which starts flowing, you can feel it."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"I have said a lot about Śhrī Gaṇeśha and His importance in our life.<br>
He is the giver of wisdom. But this wisbom ... wisdom comes from our innocence, innocence that is innate within us. As children, we are innocent, but as we grow we start exerting ourselves in a manner that we start losing our innocence.<br>
We lose it in two ways. Once we have lost our innocence, we cannot believe that others could be innocent. Another is that we think innocence is not important.<br>
Innocence is the sustainance [sustenance], is the basis of spirituality. If a person doesn’t have innocence, we [he] cannot rise in spirituality.<br>
<b>That’s why the first job of Sahaja Yoga is to establish Śhrī Gaṇeśha within you, to awaken Him. As soon as the Kuṇḍalinī awakens, you must know that Śhrī Gaṇeśha comes into being. Without His awakening within you, Kuṇḍalinī cannot be raised.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"You are sitting on it.<br>
<b>You have to vow that: ‘I will establish my Gaṇeśha.’ Don’t worry about others! Your attention on others is wrong. ‘I’ll establish my Gaṇeśha, and let this Mother Earth give me the full strength to establish my Śhrī Gaṇeśha.’</b><br>
This is very important because, unless and until your Śhrī Gaṇeśh is established, you cannot be connected to the whole, nor can you have the enjoyment of your Spirit."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"I come to you as a symbol of your Mother, but the first Son who was created was Śhrī Gaṇeśh. And then, when the Mother Earth was created as a symbol of motherhood, She created many Śhrī Gaṇeśhas in this universe. In the cosmos, the star which is called as Mars, is Śhrī Gaṇeśha. <b>All these symbols were created for you, the Sahaja Yogis to recognize them. To recognize all these symbols is easier if you are a realized Soul. But we have had so many great realized Souls in the past, of very high quality and they recognized, they found out the symbols of Śhrī Gaṇeśha, long time back.</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"A person who is not innocent cannot worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha. In His right hand He has got a paraśha [paraśhu] you must know that, a terrible instrument, you see, with one stroke He takes out your head, like guillotine it is! Those who are not innocent, play games, try tricks, gossip, indulge in filth, He cuts them off. Innocence is a very sharp thing! It does not have any compromise, which you can see in the life of Christ.<br>
With His trunk, He throws people left and right and throws them out. He sees for a while, and if people remain still half-baked they are thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.<br>
<b>No one should think that you have got Realization, you can be in the Sahaja Yoga if you do not take to Innocence. Innocence gives you complete sincerity, and Gaṇeśha is the judge, and He is the one who throws you out of the periphery like a tangent you get out of Sahaja Yoga.</b> And when you get out of Sahaja Yoga, you start going down and down and down, and then you may develop horrible diseases of the Mūlādhāra chakra. Those who are hit by Him are the worst; if you have come near him, be careful!<br>
Face yourself, see yourself, note yourself."</font><br>
