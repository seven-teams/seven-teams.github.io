<font color="DarkRed">"So, the New [Year] Day comes to remind you: `Doesn't matter, whatever has happened has happened, is finished. Today a new day has come to you again for you to promise again. Again start your journey, know the sun has come. And now be refreshed, the newness bring[s] the freshness of life.' And then you again start, greater enthusiasm on the New [Year] Day, with new ideas, with new promises, with new vows and with greater understanding about Sahaj Yog."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Whenever a new year starts, then a new thing, a new concept, a new understanding awakens inside a human being. It automatically happens. <b>Whosoever started the concept of new year must have been a great visionary so that on this occasion symbolically, inside human beings a new ambition, a new thought, a new revolution should awaken.</b> Like today many new years have come and gone, new ambitions came, new concepts came and finished."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So today is a day of a new year and we should think why do we have new years -- what is the need to have a new year? We want something new that you start something afresh to ourselves, to others, to your Mother, to your Guru. That you have to get out of the clutches of ignorance and darkness. That you have to get out of the bondages of ego. That you have to become absolutely a free glorious personality. And that you have to fight the superego influences and all the bad conditionings should be thrown as torn clothes and should wear new beautiful clothes of Sahaja Yogis.<br>
Let all the people, let all the Sahaja Yogis raise their voices from the top of their houses and top of their mountains, the top of their higher positions. Broadcast to the whole world, inform the whole people that you have found the Truth and everybody has to find the Truth, otherwise there is no escape. That you have found the joy and that everyone has to find it and everybody must work to get to it."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today I was thinking that uh <b>we’ll do the Pūjā to Mahālakṣhmī, would be better, so that we’ll understand what is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma is.</b><br>
As you know, the Mahālakṣhmī Principle lies within all of you, in the center. And once you are fed up with the falsehood, and also with the hypocrisy of people, you start seeking the Truth within. That’s how a new category of people are born, who are called as seekers – sādhakas. They are very different from others. They don’t care for any material gain or any power, position. They want to seek the Truth. And this category is the one you are, and that’s why you have come to Sahaja Yoga."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>Jaya padma palasākṣhi, jaya twam Sri pati priye,<br>

<font size="+1">Glory to the one who has eyes like lotus flower petals.<br>
Glory be to the one who is dear to Śhrī Viṣhṇu.<br>  
Glory be to Mother Mahalakshmi, who makes us cross the ocean of this world.</font><br>

Salutations to You, Goddess of Devas,<br>
Salutations to You, beloved of Hari,<br>
And salutations to You, the Treasure of Mercy.</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is a great day when we are celebrating Mahālakṣhmī’s Pūjā.</b> You must be knowing that today is the day of Mary, Mother of Christ, who was Mahālakṣhmī.<br>
Mahālakṣhmī’s Incarnation is very important for Sahaja Yoga. First She establishes our dharma by which we become righteous, we become religious in the real sense. After the light of Realization, we cannot do anything that is not dharma. As you know what is dharma is, and the maryādās, the boundaries of our behavior. This transformation takes place automatically. I don’t have to tell you, “Don’t do this, don’t do this,” like Ten Commandments. You, yourself, establish your dharma and you enjoy your virtues. This happens, as you know – already has happened to all of you – with the Grace of Mahālakṣhmī. Then She starts bestowing blessings on you."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"You must understand that, ‘We have to be alert, very alert.<br>
And <b>Mother depends on us, on our own<br>
personalities, that the way we are going to develop ourselves, our children, our husbands, our society of Sahaja Yoga,<br>
the whole of Vishwa Nirmal Dharm.’</b><br>
Is the woman who makes the society.<br>
The whole universe is in the hands of a woman who creates children."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>Thank You</b> for letting us participate in the salvation of mankind.<br>
<b>Thank You</b> for giving us the joy of introducing a yearning seeker to Your redeeming Motherly Love.<br>
<b>Thank You</b> for inviting all of us to the court of the Goddess.<br>
<b>Thank You</b> for establishing the Kingdom of God on Earth.<br>
<b>Thank You</b> for accepting our offerings and prayers.<br>
<b>Thank You</b> for showering Your blessings endlessly upon us.<br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Every year a new year comes and keeps coming. But people do not understand the feeling of creating a new year. They only understand that on the New year day they will wear new clothes and celebrate. They never think that a new year is coming and what new thing we must think of. Whatever has been going on, it goes on day after day.<br>
In Sahaja Yoga when we are so collective, then we must think what new thing we must have in Sahaja Yoga. You have gone quite deep in meditation. You understand meditation and you have also established a certain state. But in a new year what new aspect you should take, we must put out attention towards this. We must think what are the problems of our country and also the problems of the world, and how can we solve them. For this, I think wherever a Sahaja Yogi has interest he should put attention on that."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today you have to take a vow because it’s a new year’s day, such a great day when we are here to say that even if we have to give our lives we give it for Sahaja Yoga because one life can save thousands. Then why not do it? One life has Christ saved so many of us with our Āgñyā chakra. <b>Sahaja Yoga no doubt is fun and joy. But it is sharing.</b>"</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"So, <b>for today’s New Year, let us vow within ourselves, that the selfishness or the self-centeredness or the smallness in you is finished.</b><br>
Now the drop has become the ocean.<br>
Live like an ocean and like a lion.<br>
Don’t roar at others, I mean [be] generous and don’t be afraid of anything. Everything is taken care of, but believe that everything is taken care of. Sometimes you might feel you are let down, sometimes you’ll feel, “Oh, this should have happened.”<br>
Do not desire for anything! Whatever is your desire is not correct, that’s all. If the desire is correct and is deserving, it will happen – hundred percent!<br>
<b>So all the best, and the greatest year, and happiness and joy.</b>"</font><br>
