<font color="DarkRed">"Now, as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned, the basic thing is Kuṇḍalinī. And <b>the Kuṇḍalinī, as I have told you, is the pure desire. Again it, listen to it carefully: pure desire. That means all other desires are impure. There’s only one pure desire. And that is to be one with the Divine. One with the Brahma, one with God,</b> that’s the only pure des... desire. All other desires are impure. So, train your mind gradually to achieve that desire as the main thing. If you train your mind in that fashion, then you can develop pure desire, so all other desires will negate, gradually. All right.<br>
Now, this desire to be one with the Divine is the purest and the highest. And to achieve that, what have you to do? <b>To achieve that you have to keep your Mother pleased, very simple.</b> Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya has said that “You don’t bother about anything, just keep your Mother pleased.” You have to be simple person, not try to be cunning with Me or clever with Me, I know everyone very well. Try to tell yourself that, ‘I should say things, I should behave in a manner that will please my Mother.’ Supposing you are in Sahaja Yoga and you are doing wrong things, it is not going to please Me at all. So, ‘How to please Mother,’ that you should try to see for yourself, what kind of a thing pleases Me the best. I am also a very simple person. So I want a simple-hearted person, who is simple-hearted."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"Kuṇḍalinī Śhakti is the Power of Desire of Bhagavatī.<br>
She is easily awakened just by the Wish (Saṅkalpa) of Bhagavatī.<br>
A person of very high order has to put in great efforts for it."<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>It’s an individual journey towards God when you meditate. And when you reach there, then you become collective.</b> Before that it’s an absolute individual journey within, absolutely individual journey. You should be able to see this that, in this journey, nobody is your relation, nobody is your brother, nobody is your friend. You’re absolutely alone, absolutely alone. You have to move alone within yourself.<br>
Don’t hate anyone, don’t be responsible. But in meditative mood you are alone. No one exists there, you alone. And once you enter into that Ocean, then the whole world becomes your family, the whole world is your own manifestation, all the children become your children and you treat all people with equal understanding.<br>
The whole expansion takes place when you enter inside your Spirit and see through the eyes of the Spirit. There’s such calm, such peace, such bliss exists within you.<br>
You have to be ready for that journey. That journey is alone in your meditativeness. And the more you find something in your meditation the more you want to go and distribute it to others."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"When you are in complete thoughtless awareness, and the Kuṇḍalinī is on the Sahasrāra, if you ask any question to yourself then you get your answer in thoughtless awareness and that is 100% correct, because that is the answer of God, that means through the Spirit."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Sahaja Yoga, as I have told you, is not for one person, it is not for one country, it is for the whole universe. That’s why I said, now, we have established the Religion of Sahaja Yoga, is what we call the Universal Nirmala Religion [Vishwa Nirmala Dharma]. And this religion doesn’t have any faith in the low-level caste system, low-level racial systems, low-level political systems, and low-level economic systems. It has its own understanding of the Divinity and it works with that."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"Now, we always try to relate Sahaja Yoga from our own terms, not from the terms that belong to God. 
God is what He is, He cannot change Himself. You have to change. So whatever we think about God, we want to put on that."</b></font><br>
