<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b> I should say tonight is the Christmas eve and we are all here. We have to understand that now we have really entered into the area of Jerusalem and where you are built in such a way that we can understand the Great Incarnation of Christ. So far He was never understood because It was a very subtle Incarnation and that has made people go much away from Him, from the Principle of which He was made, the Innocence.<br>
<b>So today we have to remember how He incarnated on this Earth, the innocence, the auspiciousness which was filled by Ādi Śhakti, to begin with when She started to create this universe, that He was the Embodiment of all that which was so necessary before the creation started.</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Music is very important for Sahaja Yoga as you know that, through music, the vibrations spread very well and one can go very deep into your own meditation through music."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"From His childhood to His death He was jolly person, He was happiness, He was joy. To make you all happy, to give you the light of happiness by enlightening your Source of Joy, that is your Spirit in your heart. That He came on this Earth – not only to save you – first to give you happiness, to give you joy. Because human beings in their ignorance and in this tomfoolery, are unnecessarily beating themselves and destroying themselves. When nobody asked you to go to pubs to get into trouble; nobody has asked you to go to races and become bankrupts; nobody has asked you to go to horrible gurus and get into troubles. But you seek your destruction morning till evening. Then He comes there, like a morning flower, to make you happy. First to make you happy, to give you joy. You see any child ... You see any child at least I know Myself, I don’t know about the funny people here I mean, for them flowers also look like thorns, I mean I don’t know how they manage that stuff. But you see a child anywhere, any child, such a joy-giving thing it is. And this is the Child of the Divine – that comes on this Earth as a Child – is the most joy-giving thing. And that’s why Christmas for all of us, for the whole Universe, should be a festival of great joy. For He brought light for us by which you could see that there is someone called as ‘God’. There is someone, who is going to remove this ignorance. This was the first beginning.<br>
<b>So, for us, it is necessary to be first joyous and be happy and relaxed, and not to take anything that seriously as we take. Because divine life doesn’t make you serious.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"We are creating a beautiful manger for Christ, to create the peace on Earth. We have to be peaceful!<br>
To be peaceful one has to be humble.<br>
<b>This is the message of Christ: humble.</b><br>
If we become humble, peace will come.<br>
Humble is a good word, I don’t know if it explains what it means.<br>
<b>Humble means not asking for your own comfort but comfort of others. When others are before you, that is humility.</b>"</font><br>
