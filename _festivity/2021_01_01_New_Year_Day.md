<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, again, is a New Year’s Day, every new year comes, because we have to take to something that is new. It has been so arranged that the Sun has to move for 365 days and again a new year has to come.</b><br>
Actually, the whole solar system is moving in a spiral way. So, there is definitely a higher, higher state of this solar system. Every year it is rising higher in a spiral way. So it is not only that, it is because 365 days have passed because it has moved a step forward higher than what it was. Now, we can see that in awareness, human beings have definitely risen much higher than what they were, say, about 2,000 years back, but the first system that started, the whole universe was the first model, you can say was created, and that model has to be perfect and that was a perfect model which then started perfecting the rest of it.<br>
So that is the perfect model which is in the Principle of this Ascent and that is working out this ascent. Now the perfection of the rest of the universe takes place in various directions.<br>
But today we have to consider the Mahālakṣhmī Principle. Now Mahālakṣhmī, as I told you, is a perfect principle, is a perfect principle, it’s perfect. It is born as perfect, will remain as perfect, will be always eternally perfect so that it is not necessary to be corrected."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So, the New [Year] Day comes to remind you: ‘Doesn’t matter, whatever has happened has happened, is finished.<br>
<b>Today a new day has come to you again for you to promise again.</b><br>
Again start your journey, know the sun has come.<br> 
And now be refreshed, the newness bring[s] the freshness of life.’<br>
<b>And then you again start, greater enthusiasm on the New [Year] Day, 
with new ideas, with new promises, with new vows and with greater understanding about Sahaj Yog.</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Today I was thinking that uh <b>we’ll do the Pūjā to Mahālakṣhmī, would be better, so that we’ll understand what is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma is.</b><br>
As you know, the Mahālakṣhmī Principle lies within all of you, in the center. And once you are fed up with the falsehood, and also with the hypocrisy of people, you start seeking the Truth within. That’s how a new category of people are born, who are called as seekers – sādhakas. They are very different from others. They don’t care for any material gain or any power, position. They want to seek the Truth. And this category is the one you are, and that’s why you have come to Sahaja Yoga."</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"So, for today’s New Year, <b>let us vow within ourselves, that the selfishness or the self-centeredness or the smallness in you is finished.</b><br>
Now the drop has become the ocean. Live like an ocean and like a lion.<br>
Don’t roar at others, I mean [be] generous and don’t be afraid of anything.<br>
Everything is taken care of, but believe that everything is taken care of.<br>
......<br>
Don’t worry about anything else but worry about the Sahaja Yoga that has to be established all over the world.<br>
Very great work one has done."</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we are going to worship Mahālakṣhmī Principle within us.</b><br>
As you know very well that Mahālakṣhmī Principle resides in the central path of our being, through which Kuṇḍalinī has to rise. But Kuṇḍalinī enters into our body through the left side. In the sense that is the residual power of creating everything, left side, right side, and then She enters into our sacrum bone.<br>
So, in the Mahālakṣhmī temple, in Kolhapur, they sing a song of Kuṇḍalinī Ambe that, “Oh Ambā, please rise,” “Kuṇḍalinī, please rise.” In the Mahālakṣhmī temple, they have to do it because through Mahālakṣhmī channel only She rises.<br>
Now the Mahālakṣhmī Principle within us starts manifesting when our Lakṣhmī Principle is complete. Mahālakṣhmī Principle is to ascend above all material seekings."</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>This Mahālakṣhmī Principle when manifests in your Sahasrāra, then there are no words that one can express how it brings a divine light in you.</b> You know you are knowing the Truth, you know it very well. You know what is reality. You are so knowledgeable. Still, you don’t look down upon people who are ignorant. So in Sahasrāra it manifests compassion, tremendous compassion. Now one may say how can brain have compassion? But the Kuṇḍalinī comes out of the Heart center. That Heart center enlightens your heart and the first thing that shows in you is the feeling of tremendous compassion. You don’t worry about yourself, you do not think about yourself, you all the time you are thinking about others’ Realization.<br>
And as soon as you start paying attention to that, that person gets all right. You are on solid grounds and you are so confident but at the same time we are extremely humble, kind, and gentle."</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"So today the <b>first and the foremost vow is</b>, as I told you, that we have to get cleansed up in such a way that we become free of ego and superego. 
We should get rid of our ignorance and darkness.<br>
<b>And the second vow as I have said</b> that you have to become the light to remove the darkness and ignorance of others.<br> 
......<br>
And I request you to join hands with Me, with full determination and complete attention and the heart of a lion."</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"And you all know about the importance of Mahālakṣhmī. That Suṣhumṇā nāḍī is the channel for Mahālakṣhmī. But this Principle of Mahālakṣhmī is only possible to manifest in us when our Principle of Lakṣhmī is satisfied.<br>
......<br>
<b>So the Principle of the Divine works through Mahālakṣhmī.</b> It’s a vicious circle that you have to get to a point where your Lakṣhmī Principle is satisfied and then only you start seeking, and that seeking comes from the Mahālakṣhmī Principle within us.<br>
So Sahaja Yoga grows in the middle path, in the middle section of the society. Very rich will seldom come to Sahaja Yoga, and if they come only, they’ll just take few advantages of it, and they won’t understand the depth of it. In the same way the poor cannot come. So these are like the two shores of one river that is flowing in between, and if we start expanding it, then we will definitely shower the blessings of the Divine on all both the shores, and I’m sure lots of people who look today to be poor, and who appear to be rich, will definitely become Sahaja Yogis."</font><br>

It is such a blessing for all of us to worship Our Divine Mother as Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī on this auspicious New Year Day. Her wish is to see all Her children in a thoughtless awareness state by establishing Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī Principle within and spread this heavenly joy to as many as possible.<br>
On this New Year Day let us all make a vow at Her Divine Lotus Feet that we are going to keep our goals to build Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī within, by which we can strengthen the power to exhibit this Vishwa Nirmala Dharma to the whole world.</font><br>
