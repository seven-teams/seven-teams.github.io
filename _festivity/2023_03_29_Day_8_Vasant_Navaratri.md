<font color="DarkRed">"<b>It's an individual journey towards God when you meditate. And when you reach there, then you become collective.</b> Before that it's an absolute individual journey within, absolutely individual journey.<br>
You should be able to see this that, in this journey, nobody is your relation, nobody is your brother, nobody is your friend. You're absolutely alone, absolutely alone. You have to move alone within yourself.<br>
Don't hate anyone, don't be responsible. But in meditative mood you are alone. No one exists there, you alone. And once you enter into that Ocean, then the whole world becomes your family, the whole world is your own manifestation, all the children become your children and you treat all people with equal understanding.<br>
The whole expansion takes place when you enter inside your Spirit and see through the eyes of the Spirit. There's such calm, such peace, such bliss exists within you.<br>
You have to be ready for that journey. That journey is alone in your meditativeness. And the more you find something in your meditation the more you want to go and distribute it to others."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Now, as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned, the basic thing is Kuṇḍalinī. And <b>the Kuṇḍalinī, as I have told you, is the pure desire. Again it, listen to it carefully: pure desire.</b> That means all other desires are impure. <b>There’s only one pure desire. And that is to be one with the Divine. One with the Brahma, one with God</b>, that’s the only pure des... desire. All other desires are impure. So, train your mind gradually to achieve that desire as the main thing. If you train your mind in that fashion, then you can develop pure desire, so all other desires will negate, gradually. All right.<br>
Now, this desire to be one with the Divine is the purest and the highest. And to achieve that, what have you to do? <b>To achieve that you have to keep your Mother pleased, very simple.</b> Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya has said that “You don’t bother about anything, just keep your Mother pleased.” You have to be simple person, not try to be cunning with Me or clever with Me, I know everyone very well. Try to tell yourself that, ‘I should say things, I should behave in a manner that will please my Mother.’ Supposing you are in Sahaja Yoga and you are doing wrong things, it is not going to please Me at all. So, ‘How to please Mother,’ that you should try to see for yourself, what kind of a thing pleases Me the best. I am also a very simple person. So I want a simple-hearted person, who is simple-hearted."</font><br>

O Chaste Lady, residing in the Sacrum bone, whose creation is the chakras, and who knows all the secret techniques of the path to Self-realisation;<br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So She is the Redeemer and She connects you to God.</b> In the sense, She is the bridge. And the Kuṇḍalinī rises over the bridge. And Kuṇḍalinī is the Mahākālī. Now we have a temple in India which you have visited of Mahālakṣhmī in Kolhapur; and there, when they sing, when they worship Mahālakṣhmī at that time they say “Udho, udho, Ambe.” That time they say: <b>“O Ambe, the Kuṇḍalinī, You rise.”</b><br>
But Kuṇḍalinī is the potential of all the three powers: Mahākālī, Mahālakṣhmī, Mahāsaraswatī because it is the Primordial Desire. Because She is the Holy Ghost, you see, so She contains all these three powers in it. Like Ādi Śhakti has all the three powers of Mahākālī, Mahālakṣhmī, Mahāsaraswatī."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Now, in the Mahālakṣhmī channel, we have to talk about Gaurī. Because Gaurī is the one which is the Kuṇḍalinī. So they have to talk that’s why they say “Ude, ude hey Ambe.” They say in the Mahālakṣhmī temple. Why because, in the Mahālakṣhmī temple only they have to say that now you rise, we are ready, we are prepared, we have got the Mahālakṣhmī Principle within us and now you can rise,’ the Kuṇḍalinī and that’s why the āvāhana."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we have gathered here to worship the Ādi Kuṇḍalinī and your own Kuṇḍalinī, both of them because your Kuṇḍalinī is the reflection of the Ādi Kuṇḍalinī.</b> We have understood a lot about Kuṇḍalinī and also we know that through Her awakening only, through Her ascent only, we have ascended into a very higher realm of consciousness. It’s not only that we have risen to a very higher realm of awareness but that it has granted us so many powers that, never before in the history of spirituality people had this power of awakening of Kuṇḍalinī."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>First of all, I think this is the most important thing to understand about your own Kuṇḍalinī, as Self-realization is Self-knowledge. And the one who gives you Self-knowledge is this, your own Kuṇḍalinī</b>, because when She rises She points it out what are the problems on your chakras. Now, we say that it is pure desire, but we do not know what purity means. It means your chaste desire. It means it has no lust, greed, anything in it. That power is your own mother and is settled in your triangular bone. She’s your own mother. She knows everything about you, it’s like a tape recorder. She knows everything about you and She is absolutely the knowledge – because She’s so pure. And whatever chakras She touches, She also knows what’s wrong with that chakra – beforehand. So She’s quite prepared, and She adjusts Herself fully so that you do not get a problem by Her awakening. If any chakra is constricted, She waits and goes on slowly opening that chakra. Now, this Kuṇḍalinī is the Primordial Power which is reflected within you. And within you, in a human being it is like many strands of energy. So it’s like a rope and these energies are all twisted together to form this Kuṇḍalinī. In a human being these strands are three into seven – that is twenty-one – raised to power 108. But when your Kuṇḍalinī rises, one or two strands out of this come up and pierce the fontanel bone area – only one or two. Because it has to pass through the innermost nāḍī, known as Brahma nāḍī. It’s all a spiral throughout because Kuṇḍalinī is a spiral and these nāḍīs are also – are like a spiral like this. So the innermost nāḍī is the Brahma nāḍī. The outermost nāḍī is the right side and the second innermost is the Iḍā nāḍī."</font><br>
