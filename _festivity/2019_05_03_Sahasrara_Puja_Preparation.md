<font color="DarkRed">"<b>We have to create the great day for us to be proud that we belong to this Great Religion of Truth.</b><br>
There has been no religion so far which is the Religion of Truth. It practices something and preaches something and it has nothing to do with the Incarnation. You have to do something that people should say we can see our Mother in this person.<br>
......<br>
Now you are grown-up people, you have to become responsible for this Mahā Yoga and for this Great Dharma that we have established. The Dharma that Integrates all the Dharmas. The Dharma that purifies anybody who comes near. It’s the Ocean of all the Rivers. All the rivers flow to this Great Ocean of Vishwa Dharma.<br>
So we have to mold ourselves to fit into the new pattern, the new rhythm, the new music of divine flute. Unless and until that happens, I do not think that Western people have much chance. <b>If you have come for Sahasrāra, be prepared.</b>"</font><br>
