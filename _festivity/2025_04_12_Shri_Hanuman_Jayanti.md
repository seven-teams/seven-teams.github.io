<font color="DarkRed">"Today we are celebrating Hanumāna's Jayanti [birthday].<br>
What to say about Hanumāna? The more powerful and wise, He was equally devoted and dedicated.<br>
Generally such a powerful person becomes right-sided and considers himself so high that he would not listen to anyone else.<br>
<b>But Hanumāna is a special Deity, a typical Deity full of qualities. There was a perfect balance between his devotion and power.</b> How could he achieve this balance is a thing to be understood. In Sahaja Yoga, when we are enlightened, we get many powers. Then we have to keep balance. We love others and with the power of the love, we keep on doing our duties.<br>
Śhrī Hanumāna was very powerful. He had many Divine Powers in Him Navadhā, that is Garima, Laghima, etc. He could be as big as he wanted to be and as small as an atom. He had achieved all these powers. Without attaining balance and coming to the central path."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we have come here to do Hanumāna's Pūjā.</b><br>
Śhrī Hanumāna is a great character in our being and He runs all the way from Swādhiṣhṭhāna to your brain and He supplies all the necessary guidance we need in our futuristic planning or in our mental activities. <b>He gives us guidance and protection.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"It is such a joy today, and the whole atmosphere seems to be bubbling with it, as if the angels are singing.<br>
And <b>the speciality of Hanumāna was that He was an angel</b>.<br>
Angels are born like angels. They are angels, and they are not human beings. They're born with the angelic qualities.<br>
But now, you all have become angels from the human beings. It's a very great achievement of Sahaja Yoga.<br>
The qualities that are born with the angels are seen from their very childhood.<br>
So <b>in the left side we have gaṇas, on the right side we have angels. And translated in Sanskrit language or in any Indian language as Devadūt -- means they are the Ambassadors of Gods.</b><br>
So now you are the same, you are all angels now. Only thing you are not aware that you are angels while they were aware from their childhood. If you know that you are angels, all your qualities will start shining through, and you'll be amazed that the quality of standing by the Truth at any cost is so easily managed for you, because you have been given the right, you have been given the special blessings, the special protection from the Divine that if you stand for the right, and if you stand for the righteous, and if you stand for the Truth, all kinds of help to protect you will be given.

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are worshiping Śhrī Hanumāna. So we should think that He resides within us. He controls our right side -- the Piṅgalā channel -- and gives us zeal.</b> As a result heat is generated. But his path is such that the heat [power] and devotion should go side by side. So the heat, the energy acts on right side but without the balance of Śhrī Hanumāna this heat gives birth to many diseases in us, such as liver problem, bronchial asthma and heart attacks. When this heat goes downward, Śhrī Hanumāna tries to control it, but when the heat goes out of his control then many incurable diseases emanate from it.<br>
......<br>
<b>Anger is not the Power of Śhrī Hanumāna.</b> There is absolutely no need to get angry with others. If you respect Śhrī Hanumāna, you have no need to get angry. <b>Śhrī Hanumāna never gets angry with anyone. But we human beings are infuriated over silly things. Ego plagues us. Śhrī Hanumāna had no ego at all. Generally right-sided people are ego-oriented.</b> Human beings have so much of ego that I cannot understand! When I try to see through them, there appears to be no cause for this ego. "</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"You should understand that Śhrī Hanumāna is the ideal before you. Lord Gaṇeśha is also there. He was innocence incarnate. He is as innocent as a small child. But he is very wise and discreet. Śhrī Hanumāna is balanced and full of love and joy. At the same time He is power incarnate.<br>
<b>Sahaja Yogis should understand all these things and his life and character should be well balanced. When angry, you should watch silently.</b><br>
I think I never get angry.<br>
Without getting angry every thing works out.But people could not control their anger. In the fit of anger they start abusing."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Hanumāna is the Deity for your air</b>, for your breathing, and when you try to suffocate Hanumāna within you, you get the trouble of His disappearing from that center or you can say He sleeps and you get these two troubles: of one is asthma and also sometimes you might get choking."</font><br>

O Protector of Heaven and Earth, please reside in my heart.
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Now, <b>He's the one who protects also all the Deities, He protects</b>.<br>
Now, there's a difference between Śhrī Gaṇeśha and Him. The Śhrī Gaṇeśha gives energy, śhakti, but the one who protects is Śhrī Hanumāna.<br>
So you'll find that when Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa was the chariot[eer] of Arjuna then on top of the chariot was sitting Hanumāna, not Śhrī Gaṇeśh. Hanumāna was sitting there looking after Him.<br>
Also in a way that Śhrī Rāma Himself becomes Śhrī Viṣhṇu, so He has to look after Him.<br>
He is an angel as you know, according to Christian, we should say, according to Bible, that He is the angel called Gabriel. Now, Gabriel is the one who brought the message, because He's always a messenger, to Maria and surprisingly the words He used were "Immaculeta Salve." That's My name. My first name is Mātājī Nirmalā Devī, means Immaculeta and surname is Salve. He said those words to Her. And today also I was surprised when it came to giving Me a present they found a tea set and dinner set which is called as 'Maria'.<br>
So Maria has to do quite a lot with Hanumāna all Her life. That means Maria is the Mahālakṣhmī. Mahālakṣhmī being the Sītā, Sītā, then Rādhā, Hanumāna has to be there to serve Her."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"I hope by today's Pūjā, that enthusiasm, that venturesome nature will vibrate your Piṅgalā, and without feeling any ego about it, in the most humble manner as Hanumāna was, you will do the jobs.<br>
Hanumāna, imagine, He was given a beautiful necklace of gold -- with big, big balls for Him to wear -- by Sītā. And He opened all of them one by one, He said, "There is no Rāma in this, what will I do with this gold?" So She said, "Where is Rāma?" He opened His heart and showed it, "See, Rāma is here."<br>
If Rāma is there, you cannot have ego. So, so much of dynamism and so much of humility -- what a combination it was. And that's what you have to just manifest. The more you'll work, the more you'll assert yourself, you will find that humility is the only thing that helps. Obedience is the only thing that helps to carry out your work and you'll become humbler and humbler. But if you think, 'Oh I am doing this' -- then finished. But if you know that it's done by the Divine, 'Paramachaitanya is doing everything, I am just an instrument,' the humility will be there and you will be an effective instrument."</b></font><br>

You are the most effective instrument for Śhrī Ādi Śhakti because You are nothing but obedience, humility, and dynamism.<br>
You make all the Sahaja Yogis join Your company to do our Holy Mother's work and transform the whole world. </font><br>
