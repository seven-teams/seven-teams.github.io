<font color="DarkRed">"She came on this Earth, many a times, to kill the people who were doing wrong things, who were trying to kill good people. She has done Her level [best] to do that, and today we are celebrating Her birthday.<br>
You all know so much about it, that I need not tell you, but what you have to know is that: <b>She came on this Earth to save you from all kinds of troubles. For Her you were important, very important, because you were doing Devī Pūj. And so we are celebrating today this Devī Pūjā, with all our heart, because whatever ill people did to you, She came to destroy them. So today is a very great day for you to thank Her: thank Her for Her protection and for Her understanding as to what you have been tortured for.</b><br>
I'm happy you are all here to celebrate Her birthday, and to be surrendered to Hers so that She can always, always, protect you, and give you Her blessings.<br>
So may God bless you all, your children, your families, and that you bring great joy er [and] protection.<br>
It's very kind of you to have come today, so far away. I'm very happy to see you. Moreover, you have got tomorrow also that you can celebrate.<br>
Today we are not going to have any questions and solutions. We are just going to worship the Goddess, that's all.<br>
<b>I request Her to protect us from all kinds of problems that are facing us.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>God is the witness and She is doing the play and She creates those chakras. In the chakras She places all these Deities to govern.</b><br> 
Now, there is the existence, there is the creation, creative force, and there is the evolutionary force, all inside the Virāṭa State.<br>
Now, this is at the Vaikuṇṭha State, we say, because this state is on this first reflection. It is not in us, or we cannot feel it, the Vaikuṇṭha State, because it is in the first thing.<br>
Then another state was created, then third was created, but the fourth one is the Bhavasāgara: is the state at which all of us were born. First, in the fourth state. Now, can you think of a four strata personality which is facing a mirror? Now, which is the first one [that] shows? Is the topmost. And that's why the topmost shows is the Bhavasāgara. But if you can go deep down into your state, you can feel all the other three. But first of all, the one which you can see and feel it, is the Bhavasāgara. So, you are born in the Bhavasāgara. At this state you are at the Bhavasāgara State. At this Bhavasāgara State, now, you are created and you have to evolve. <b>At this time the Mahālakṣhmī Power acts to evolve you.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Now you have had nine Pūjās here and out of these nine Pūjās have we improved more, have we got more? Did we fill ourselves more with greater love, with greater joy, with greater understanding and with greater satisfaction?<br>
This is the last day, so you have to think like that, then tomorrow is the day of jubilation. Because we have done what? That is what. So today you should go and make a complete picture of yourself. What have I got in these nine days? What have I got? Let us see, have I got this? Have I got that? All these things, you should just within yourself see and then enjoy that you have got all these things. It is the victory. Tomorrow is the day of victory. That you have become victorious about yourself and about your ignorance. You have won yourself and you've won over the ignorance, the darkness of ignorance. This is what is tomorrow's message."</font><br>
