<font color="DarkRed">"<b>The birthday of your Mother, and all such celebrations have a very deep significance because on such occasions</b>, special vibrations flow in the atmosphere. When all the celestial bodies, the Eternal Personalities, Gods, and Goddesses, sing the praise, and that’s how the whole atmosphere is filled with mirth and happiness. Human beings also express their gratitude. <b>Expression of gratitude and love is done in different, different ways in different countries, but the substance remains the same and the forms change.</b><br>
The substance is like the ocean which flows continuously towards the shores and the ripples which touch the shores are again repelled back, and a nice pattern is formed. It is such a spontaneous thing and is so beautiful, creates such a beautiful pattern in the atmosphere. All these waves when they weave together the pattern of love they soothe human beings, they enchant human beings and the whole thing is very blissful.<br>
On such occasions, a special type of feelings develop, which we cannot express in words so the expression could be in any form. But the main thing is the expression. God has expressed Himself by Creation, by creating this Creation. While the Creation has to express its gratitude by glorifying Him, and this play must go on eternally. It’s the most beautiful play. Those who indulge into this play lead an eternal life.<br>
That life is unending, never breaks and binds the whole universe with its beautiful music."</font><br>

...... we can say that God created this Earth, just to please His own children, just to make them happy, just to make them enter into the Kingdom of God, to give all that what He has got.<br>
So He had to create this creation in such a way that He could create His own image, reflect it and make it enjoy itself."</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today all of you have decided to celebrate My Birthday, for that I am thankful.<br>
Birthdays increase your age from one side and decrease your life from the other side. But in Sahaja Yoga, it is [the] opposite.</b> When it is your birthday you should understand there is growth in our spiritual tree [level] and it has been growing regularly. Though our life is decreasing but the light of our spirit will keep on increasing and the rays of light will enter within us and make us divine.<br>
So till we are alive this light of Spirit will keep on increasing in our soul."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>On My birthday today, I request you all to grow with Me. Grow in age. It means that you should become mature.</b> You have become one-pointed. So that is all right. This one-pointedness means that you have the chakras and the enlightenment of each one chakra. To raise the Kuṇḍalinī whereby it passes through the chakras and goes into the Sahasrāra, just think what a great thing it is. No Saint, Sage, Ṛiṣhi, Yogi, or any Incarnation has done what you people are doing. So much power has come within you. But we should have the endurance to bear this Power. The greater the voltage we can bear, the greater the voltage that will come within us. We can increase this voltage tremendously. And this year has come with a special significance. That’s why I have said all this to you, that how you can blossom fully your life, from within and outside."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>I’m telling them about Love, All-pervading Love of God Almighty. He’s created this whole thing. The whole atmosphere is there. The whole feeling is there of love.</b> But it’s possible only for people who are innocent, like children. If you are very mature in your hatred, no one can save you. You’ll have ten arguments to show that your hatred is justifiable. Then you’ll go to any extent to justify it.<br>
We had people in our country, which is a very, supposed to be a very sober country, a very peaceful country, we had people who just believe in killing – kill this, kill that. So even in this country, which didn’t believe in all these things, indulged into all kinds of violence since long. But basically, we are people who believe in peace, because without peace no growth can take place.<br>
There has to be complete peace. <b>If there is peace in your heart, if there is peace surrounding you, you grow into a beautiful nation. Not out of fear, not out of pressure, but from inside, if you are person who has complete peace within the heart, not that he is not afraid of anything, but he emits peace, he gives peace. Anybody who goes near such a person, gets the peace, the feeling of peacefulness.</b><br>
You all are Sahaja Yogis. You all have got your Realization, that is, your Spirit is now emitting vibrations of peace and joy. Wherever you are, you will emit peaceful vibrations. You will create peace. You’ll find out ways of creating peace, how to establish peaceful atmosphere. It’s very important that we have to grow in such a manner that we create peace and give peace to others and become examples of it."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>In Sahaja Yoga, to worry about anything is not Sahaj. Because it is the Paramachaitanya that does the worrying. We should have only one worry. That I should be in meditation. I should be in joy and there should be no lacking in this joy. And I may always be carefree.</b><br>
Seeing devotion, service, and love, I am pleased. But you should do your service to the Self also. Think about yourself also. Decorate yourself too and look after yourself also, that you are a jewel. Search for it fully. We are from different countries following Vishwa Nirmala Dharma. Though we come from various countries, in reality we live in only One World and that is the Kingdom of God. And we are living in joy and happiness, where we are giving joy to everyone. What a great thing it is. You are like the flowers in a garden, looking at which, great poets gets inspiration and seeing which brings joy to everyone. You are the flowers from whom I have such hope. I want that you people should do something unique and special, in each village, in the towns, whoever you can. One day will come when many Sahaj Yogis will be seen everywhere."</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So today I am asking for two things from you. It is a funny thing that Mother has to ask for a gift.</b><br>
The first gift you have to give is that you should express peacefulness through your own character. But it does not mean that you should be people who are timid or people who are morbid or who tolerate nonsense. No, but the people who are peaceful resistance. You are not afraid of anything. You are not going to bow down to anything, compromise with anything, but you have that sort of a temperament you should develop and express – is very important.<br>
And the second one is that this peace and all this should express your love? Love to others."</font><br>
