<font color="DarkRed">"Marriage gives you now a lever to be dhārmik, to be moral. This teaches you how to respect the chastity of others and your own chastity. We have to teach ourselves. You know how much damage has been already done by having bad marriages, divorces. We have to teach ourselves, we have to bear up a little bit, we have to educate, re-educate and improve ourselves and not to say that, 'I am such and such, what can I do?'<br>
You have to bring glory to the system of <b>marriages because it is the system established by God Almighty. Is not established by human beings, is a wrong idea.</b> It is established by God Almighty to have an auspicious occasion where such an auspicious thing is taken, [so] the sacredness of this is to be maintained and has to be done in such a way [that] it is a very decent relationship.<br>
All the culture, all the beauty of gracious living flows through happy married life. Not vulgar, not showing, not cheap, but a dignified, enjoyable, cheerful, welcoming, giving companionship. "</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"It is that you apply a mixture of turmeric and oil and all that to the body.<br>
To the boy first, and then it is applied to the girl so that they feel better on the body and on the face and they feel soothed down.<br>
But it’s a kind of a very jubilant thing, means now they are in for marriage, they are being now painted for [laughing:] marriage you can say ..."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Marriage is meant to give joy, is meant to give cheerfulness, happiness and all the blissful things that we can think of achieving through our combination with two human beings, we can say. It's a very close and a private relationship which has to be respected. It is not to be in any way dishonored or indiscreetly squandered away. Those who cannot respect their partners in life will never be respected anywhere else. Those who ill-treat or in any way sp... try to spoil the image of their partners are harming themselves.<br>
......<br>
Marriage is the bondage that keeps the society in its own beautiful bondage of Mother's Grace."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Now, the first ceremony is ... she is the Gaurī, and she is a kanyā, she is the virgin, you see. And so she worships Me as a virgin which is called as Gaurī Pūjan, is done in every wedding marriage, that Gaurī is first worshiped as a virgin because She should give Her blessings to the bride of her chastity and also the blessings that she will remain always loyal to her husband. And she praise[s] at the Feet of Gaurī that, 'May call the marriage ceremony nicely and everything should be done very well.' This is the essence of it that, 'Let it pass, my married life be all right.' Because Gaurī Herself worshiped Śhiva like this."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"We have to prove to the world that marriage is a divine institution and by this divine institution if you have been put together it's also a Divine Plan. And through this Divine Plan many things are going to work out. So those who are getting married today are helping Sahaja Yoga very much.<br>
I have already told you there are many Saints who want to be married. And nowadays that you see this world full of horrible people. We need so many Saints to be born and so the Saints will be born in case you have good married time, happy married life and enjoyable life."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"First is Agni Devatā because before the Agni, before the fire you are [have] promised. And the fire has a capacity to cleanse everything, to bring it to its real value, to bring it to its principle. That's why you are doing it before the fire. So first we have to worship the fire so that the fire is purified itself and that its Kuṇḍalinī is awakened.<br>
......<br>
And once the fire goes to its essence, because you are all Saints and realized Souls, it will burn away all that is bad and will bring the real value, the Principle of Marriage in you."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Is important to understand that’s marriage is a very important thing in Sahaja Yoga. Because the basis of society is a family. And our society should have very good families. That’s why we are paying so much attention to these weddings, that they should make good families.<br>
......<br>
Again and again I am telling you that it’s a very very beautiful moment when you are getting married. It’s a very beautiful time. You cannot fathom the joy at that time. And if at that time you have missed the point, that I can’t help it. Later on also try to improve your understanding. Is not a mental thing to get married, is not an emotional thing to get married: in Sahaja Yoga it is spiritual. And so, please, try to understand you have to respect each other because you are Sahaja Yogis. And others should be respected who will show you what are the seven conditions you have to go through."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī</b>: Now the <b>kanyādān is to give the girl to the boy</b>. All right is the point. The hand of the girl is given to the boy. Now. 
What you have to do is to put the boy’s hand like this and the girl’s hand has to be put by the mother into the boy’s hand from the back. 
Mother and father both. First the boy has to do and now put the hands – now.<br>
<b>Śhrī Mātājī</b>: Not too much, little bit, yes when this mantra is said, slowly. Go on pouring the water now. Start. [Mantras are recited.]<br>
He’s saying, "I’m giving this daughter to you because you must take to Brahma," means the vibrations as you call it, the Brahma Śhakti, 
"and that you must grow into it and you must create children in the same way and that you should have children of very high quality.
 That’s why I’m giving you my daughter to you."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"There's a difference between the other marriages and Sahaja Yoga marriage in which we understand that marriage has to be a special, as they call Yagñya, means a special type of a holy alliance in which you have to lead a very Sahaj life with your wife and to understand her. She is also Sahaja Yoginī. So you must respect her and you must love her, and she should really understand that you are her caring, loving, gentle husband. You must show all concern about her because she is a Sahaja Yoginī. She is not an ordinary woman, and with that respect I am sure you'll be able to lead a very beautiful Sahaj married life."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"I wish you all very great love, prosperity and joy and that you all develop in Sahaja Yoga in a very
great love and understanding, forgetting what is ... what was your past, what was your religion, what was
your uh caste, what was uh your country – everything forget.<br>
We are all really human beings and now we are realized Souls, so there is no difference like this. And
all of you should prosper in such a manner that other people should see you and try to follow in. It’s a big
responsibility, very big responsibility, I hope you understand and realize.<br>
Thank you.<br>
May God bless you."</font><br>
