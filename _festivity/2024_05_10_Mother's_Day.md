<font color="DarkRed">"[Mother's is] a very special institution ... ... especially in this country [Italy], they have such respect for their mothers.<br>
<b>Mother is the Source of Love.</b><br> 
In the Qur'ān they asked Muhammad Sāhab, Whom should we bow after Allah?" So He said, "To Mother" -- "To the Mother." Then again they asked Him, He said: "Only the Mother." Again they asked Him, He said: "Only the Mother."<br>
I'm sure He must have said about the Divine Mother, because worldly mothers may not be complete mothers, perhaps. They are a[n] embodied, or, we can say, examples of Mother's Love, of the Divine Mother's Love, but they are human.<br>
So they can be conditioned, influenced or could be egoistical, especially if they are living in a particular country for a long time and have no idea of Divine Love.<br>
In Divine Love there is no expectations, it just flows, it doesn't think how to judge a person or what to do for a person, it just flows."</font><br>

<font color="MediumVioletRed"><b>Thank You</b> for descending from Your heavenly abode, Mātā Dvīpa, to bring light into the darkness of Kali Yuga.<br> 
<b>Thank You</b>, Śhrī Mātājī, again and again.<br
<b>Thank You</b> for delivering Sahaja Yoga to a confused and self-destructive humanity.<br
<b>Thank You</b> for revealing the meaning of creation and evolution to us.<br
<b>Thank You</b> for revealing the actual existence of God to us.<br
<b>Thank You</b> for giving divine meaning to human existence.<br
<b>Thank You</b> for revealing the reflection of the Viśhwarūpa within the human body to us.</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today is ... I like the day when it is the Mother's, I should say, Mother's Day also. Because I think only a Mother can work it out that way. One has to have a lot of patience with people.<br>
......<br>
But mother's position is different. She'll go on struggling and fighting for her child. She'll fight it out to the last to see that the child gets all the benefits and this patience and this love and this forgiveness is innately built in in a mother, because her attitude is very different. Not any achievement, not any big name or what you call a sort of an award or anything. It is just she does it because she is a mother. And that is what is the sign of any mother, if she is a real mother, at least for her own children, she will go all out, she will work out everything for day in day out and to save the child from disaster. But Sahaja Yoga is a much bigger family and for that you really had to be worked out through the Mother's Principle. You cannot take any other principle.<br>
......<br>
So, in your own way, when you are doing Sahaja Yoga, there also you have to be a mother. <b>More mother's quality than the father's quality, that there's no ambition, there's no competition, there's no jealousies, nothing.</b> Just you want your children to come up and to grow into their spirituality. If that is the only attitude we have then you'll be amazed how satisfied you'll feel, because this is a very, very joy-giving thing, to see people growing in spirituality. Not only talking about it, not only reading about it, but actually happening, actualizing within yourself. So this quality is very helpful and that really helps every Sahaja Yogi to be patient, to be kind, to be humble."</font><br>

<p style="color:MediumVioletRed; text-align:center;">
May I this day be what You'd have me be.<br>
May I this day say what You'd have me say.<br>
May I this day be part and parcel of the whole<br>
And may my thoughts be of a realized soul.<br>
May I this day have love for all mankind.<br>
Mother, be in my heart and in my mind.<br>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Now, [the] Principle of Mother is in every, every Scripture, has to be there. Now the Mother's character is that She is the One Who is the Womb, She is the One Who is the Mother Earth and She is the One Who nourishes you. She's ... She nourishes us, you know that. And this feminine thing in a one ma... in every human being resides as this Kuṇḍalinī, as you have seen. And when She rises, She gives you this new awareness which becomes compassion, which is flowing, which becomes soothing, nourishing Energy of Love. And that's what today people are saying feminist go this thing and all that. That's again a pendulum -- a man becoming a woman, woman becoming man -- all these problem you have had because of this. But when you move spirally upward, then where do you move? You move, become a personality full of compassion, of love, of universal understanding, through Collective Consciousness. And then you rise up to a position where you become universally conscious. So that is what should happen to you. And, if that happens, then we should say that your motherly qualities within you have risen. And that's what we have so far neglected. You do not become a woman but you become motherly. First the Father, then the Son, and now the Mother! All right? "</font><br>

<font color="MediumVioletRed">The Mother is everything — She is our consolation in sorrow, our
hope in misery and our strength in weakness. 
She is the source of
love, mercy, sympathy, and forgiveness. And this Earth is the Mother of the trees and flowers. 
It produces them, nurses them, and weans them.
The trees and flowers become kind mothers of their great fruits and
seeds. 
And the Mother, the prototype of all existence, is the Eternal
Spirit, full of beauty and love. </font><br>
