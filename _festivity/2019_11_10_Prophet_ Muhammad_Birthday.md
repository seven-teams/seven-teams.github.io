<font color="DarkGreen">"Vaidya Sāhab has told you about Muhammad Sāhab, I have to tell you that He was My Father. And He was the Incarnation of Dattātreya Himself. He was not an ordinary person. Though the people tortured His life. Every moment that He lived, they tortured Him.<br>
And Hazarat ʿAlī is a very-very Great Incarnation where only once, only once Brahmadeva has incarnated and He has incarnated as Hazarat ʿAlī.<br>
So, these people are so great! You cannot criticize Them. They are so great -- every word that They have spoken is a Mantra. Everything They have told you about this Namāz, which is nothing but Kuṇḍalinī jāgṛuti [awakening]."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"Today, as we know that, this is the day of Muhammad Sāhib’s birthday. And we have to understand that all these Incarnations came at different times. They all came at different times. And They came as a continuous process of evolution of man. No question of conflict or anything with them. No question. You see, human beings can’t understand, because they create conflict, they are built for conflicts with this thing closing down, you see. So They just came on this earth, nobody’s property. They came as Incarnations on this Earth, all of Them."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"After that Muhammad Sāhab, who was His Incarnation. And when He was asked that -- ``Bhāī [Brother] there must have been others also before you," then He replied, ``Yes, there a Muhammad." Then again He was asked who was before him. He replied, ``There was one Muhammad." Muhammad means Praise, the One who is praised, the One who deserves to be praised and is the One who is Redeemer of the world. They were all Muhammads, they were all Dattātreyas, who came on Earth regularly."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkGreen">"Mother is the Source of Love. In the Qur'ān they asked Muhammad Sāhab whom should we bow after Allah? So He said ``to Mother" -- ``to the Mother."<br>
Then again they asked Him, He said: ``Only the Mother." Again they asked Him, He said: ``Only the Mother."<br>
I'm sure He must have said about the Divine Mother, because worldly mothers may not be complete mothers, perhaps. They are a[n] embodied, or, we can say, examples of Mother's Love, of the Divine Mother's Love, but they are human."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkGreen">"Muhammad Sāhab has said that: ``At the Time of Resurrection your hands will speak." What does that mean? No Muslim wants to think about it. He doesn't want to understand what Namāz means. Namāz is nothing but raising of the Kuṇḍalinī."</font><br>
