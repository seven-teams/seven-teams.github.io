<font color="DarkRed">"So, this special thing is that we are worshiping a Deity on the right Āgñyā which makes you think too much, first of all, and also it makes you aggressive, and also it makes you a very right-sided. By this worship, you will become very mild, very gentle, very beautiful people and you’ll be able to see things much more clearly.<br>
Now, this right side gives you a kind of a[n] ego which troubles everyone, but you could never feel the trouble till you get into a very serious state. It gives you the overactivity of the brain and conscious mind works too hard. For that you are, you are not very hard working people, but you can see, first of all, that your mind is more active than your body. So, this Āgñyā chakra has to be controlled by Buddha, and that’s why we do Pūjā today."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today we have decided to celebrate the Buddha Jayanti, it's the day of Buddha's birthday. In the whole map of time, Buddha came to this Earth at a time when it was so important for Him to come. That time, especially in India, we had two types of people: one, who were very ritualistic, trying to be extremely strict and disciplined; and the another were the people who were too much conditioned and were full of so-called devotion to God. So these two types of people were occupying the area of seekers. So it was necessary to neutralize these two styles of seekings."</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"When Lord Buddha came on this Earth, He found the problem very intricate about God: everybody was talking that they know God and everybody's God was different, and in the name of God they were raising wars. So, He decided that, 'Don't talk of God anymore now because everybody wants to talk at Him. Better not talk of God at this moment when they are not knowing about their Spirit.'<br>
So He just talked of the Self, the Spirit. What He says: "Buddham śharaṇaṃ gacchāmi." [As Marie has no reaction in translating:] "Buddham śharaṇaṃ gacchāmi," "I surrender myself to Buddha," Buddha means the one who knows, the one who has the knowledge -- it's a realized Soul.<br> 
In Sahaja Yoga also, we go step by step. First of all, we have to know our Spirit, not through mental projection but with a spontaneous happening, which is a living happening. They think that human beings cannot do it."<br></font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen"><b>Shri Mataji, salutations to Thee again and again.<br>
Thou art the Primordial Splendor of God, the Ādi Śhakti and Mother of the Devatas.<br> 
Thou art the roots of all action, the success in any action and the sole and only Doer in the countless universes of Thy creation.<br>
Thou art Śhrī Mahāmāyā, the Mother of the Ādi Ahaṅkāra, the Primordial Ego of God, the Prince of Kapilavastu who became, by Thy Grace, the Buddha. </b></font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today's Pūjā is very important</b>, because I feel Western countries have gone off with their ego, and they need Buddha very much, and they like also this so-called Buddhism very much, because you see, they can then just hide behind that camouflage. "We are Buddhist, you see." They'll worry about Afghanistan and they'll worry about lama. They'll worry about all other people, because, "You see, we are Buddhist." But there's no truth in it, no truth.<br>
<b>Sahaja Yogis have to establish that truth, that dedication. So Buddha has said, "Buddham śharaṇaṃ gacchāmi." I bow to all those who are realized Souls. "Dhammam śharaṇaṃ gacchāmi." "I bow myself, to my dharma." That is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma. And then lastly is, "Saṅghaṃ śharaṇaṃ gacchāmi." "I bow to collectivity."</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So the Buddha's main thing -- `Buddha' itself means Bodh, from Bodha. And the Bodh means, `to know the reality on your central nervous system' is the Bodha.<br> 
You all have become now Buddhas without giving up anything, because whatever He gave up was all nonsense. It was a myth. If it was a myth ....... But still one has to know that we have to have that Principle of Buddha within ourselves. And what is that Principle of Buddha is that we have to do Tapaḥ. "</font><br>
