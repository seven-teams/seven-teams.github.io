<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we are worshiping Ādi Śhakti.</b><br>
I think this is the most important Pūjā, because it is the Power of Ādi Śhakti that has given you Self-realization, that has given you the Truth, that has given you the Power of Compassion and Love.<br>
That’s the power that separated from Sadāśhiva. And this Power wanted Herself to create this Complete Universe: universes after universes. She’s creating and loving. With Her love, She did this Great Creation, Creation of this world also.<br>
This is a specially selected planet, which was very beautifully brought in the center, between the Sun and the Moon, for the creation of, ultimately, the human beings.<br>
This is Her great work [done] with such love and affection, and with very great hope that Her children will know the Truth and will get the Ultimate Knowledge about themselves, and about everything else."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Pūjā, as I have told you many a times, is not for My benefit, by any chance, take it from Me. I’m much better off without it. Because when the enthusiastic Deities start emitting vibrations with your im... asking. Because you are Saints, so They just, They are overenthusiastic. And They are sitting there, busybodies, you know [soft laughter]. They are sitting quietly waiting for a chance, you see, to emit vibrations, to save you, you see, They want to just rush. They emit so much [laughing:] that They lose, ‘Just wait, just wait.’ They want to save you, They want to give you, They’re so anxious, in Their anxiety to save you. I like it, to see the way They are anxious. But [laughs] ... but you don’t suck it and I have a problem there. Once They’ve given They don’t want to take it back. You don’t suck it, so it has to go to the atmosphere, it has to disappear somewhere. Is directed towards you and you don’t take it, so where does it go? It hangs into My tissues, it pains Me.<br>
So, sucking should be more. Sucking should be more. And just before the Pūjā you should say: 'Mother, make me such that I suck more of the Divine!' Just pray that, with sincerity from your heart, just say that."</font><br>

<b>Binatī Suniye Ādi Śhakti Meri</b><br>
O Ādi Śhakti, please listen to my request<br>
<b>Pūjana kā adhikār. dījiye</b><br>
Please give me the authority to do Your Pūjā<br>
<b>Śharaṇāgat. hai hṛiday. pujārī</b><br>
Your worshipper is surrendered to You from the heart.<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"But many universes have been created by Ādi Śhakti, even before us. And She has tried many other things also. Ultimately She has tried this: She has created Earth and then created us. Now how She has done that we’ll see later on. Just now let us see how She assumes Her ... Her Power.<br>
When She decides to create, She is endowed with Three Powers: She has Three Powers of God which are granted to Her. By one power, first of all, is the existence, the desire to exist, She desires to exist with God. The second power is to create and the third power is to sustain. First power is existence, second is to create and the third is the evolving power or sustainance [sustenance] power by which gradually you sustain something and you become something. These are the Three Powers She assumes. In short, we can say that <b>She forms Three Powers of Mahākālī, Mahāsaraswatī and Mahālakṣhmī. These are the Three Powers She assumes within Herself</b>."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>You perhaps do not realize that all the Deities who reside in you and who are controlled in your Sahasrara are not at all interested in people who are not completely surrendered to me. I do not know how to convince them. They only look after those who take my name and accept that I am the Adi Shakti. This is the only way you can progress. What can I do? Even the people who are cured by me have to keep the protocol otherwise the Deities sleep and they go back to their previous position.</b><br>
So far I have not said this to anyone because I thought there was no need. Those who were wise realized it and those who are foolish have lost their chance in Sahaja Yoga.</b>"</font><br>

Thou Art the Primordial Splendour of God,<br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"But today is the day, I declare that I am the One who has to save the humanity. I declare I am the One who is Ādi Śhakti, who is the Mother of all the Mothers, who is the Primordial Mother, the Śhakti, the Desire of God, who has incarnated on this Earth to give Its meaning to Itself, to this creation, to human beings, and I'm sure through My Love and Patience and My Powers, I am going to achieve it.<br>
I was the One who was born again and again, but now in My Complete Form and Complete Powers, I have come on this Earth, not only for salvation of human beings, not only for their emancipation, but for granting them, the Kingdom of Heaven, the Joy, the Bliss, that your Father wants to bestow upon you."</b></font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Love is the Message of Ādi Śhakti.</b> Now you think about it. One Ādi Śhakti created the whole world. How she must have done it. What she must have planned. How she must have organized. It is not a[n] easy thing. Only because she loved. Love is the expression that you are all there. That is why to be one with Her one should learn to love. Of course in that you have to know that you should forgive. If you don’t know how to forgive and find mistakes of other people you won’t help. What is your now job is, is to see that you are loving, no hatred for anyone, you don’t think of hating anyone and hitting somebody. This has to work out."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>Thank You, O Śhrī Ādi Śhakti, for the seeking which brought us to Sahaja Yoga.<br> 
You now lift up humanity into the omega of the Last Judgment.<br>
We pray that Śhrī Ādi Śhakti’s love continues to protect all the saints and seekers around the world.<br>
Śhrī Ādi Śhakti, Your work is greater than any.<br>
You created the pithas, the chakras, nature and humanity, and its subtle workings.<br>
May the complexity of Your work humble us down completely.<br>
Your love gives power to the bandhan, which directs the vibrations.<br>
Your power of Kuṇḍalinī brings freedom that is divine. It is the only true freedom.</b></font><br>
