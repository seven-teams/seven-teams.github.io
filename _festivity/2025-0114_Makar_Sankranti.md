<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is Saṅkrānti. Saṅkrānti means that today there is something new going to happen. Kuṇḍalinī has awakened within you and you have become new person compared to what you were before. But on the day of Saṅkrānti, you should know that you have to please the Goddess who is sitting within you.</b> What should you do to make Her happy? You distributed sesame seeds and jaggery. That is for love. To increase the love between each other, we give sesame seeds and jaggery.<br>
Today the Sun left its place and, in its northward movement, came towards us. At this moment we should be very thankful to the Sun. It is by the grace of the Sun that so many things take place in our country. We have to do namaskār to the Sun today and His Power and His knowledge should come to us. I would say that all of you have become realized and vibrations are flowing through you. Now you should make use of these vibrations, establish the śhakti within you, establish the peace within you and show the world that this power is within us and we have to acquire it. We have to nurture this, improve this with your good qualities and truthful speech."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Is the day of revolution. <b>Saṅ-krānt means: saṅ means, you know, auspicious, krānt means revolution. Today is the day of holy revolution.</b><br>
I have told you about the rebellion, that in rebellion we move in a pendulum from one to another end as a result of inertia.<br>
But through the ascent, when we achieve a higher state, it's only possible when there is a revolution. And revolution takes spirally: the movement has to be spiral to land up at a higher position.<br>
<b>So this is the revolution, which is the holy revolution.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today is the day they give you a sweet thing to say that: `You must s-speak sweetly,' which is very important for Western people. That when you are doing and organizing, you become heated up, there's tension and you develop the temperament which is dry, emotionless, you know the heart goes into a tantrum. At that time, they say that, 'You take the sweet.'<br>
This sweet is a heated thing because now the Sun is moving towards the other side. That time, also they, to give it a balance, they say: `Speak very sweetly. Use sweet words, use sweetness. Bring sweetness in your language.' Which is very important, you understand that.<br>
And this is one of the religions we have to accept: that we will not use harsh words to each other, and then later on to others.<br>
First of all to each other. There are very [many] people who will be kind to others, because others will eat them off, but unkind to their own Sahaja Yogis.<br>
Because it is a universal happening. It's the whole thing is ... is working out universally.<br>
<b>Even if you organize, you organize for the whole. Those who are organizing, have no business to be harsh. And those who are not organizing, has [have] no business to be slow. We must move with the same speed, with the same understanding.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"I am talking about the revolution within ourselves. <b>In this revolution you are very much helped by your own mother, the Kuṇḍalinī. And you evolve in a very sweet manner, in a spiral ascent to land up as realized Souls."</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Most of the festivals are based on the situation [position] of the Moon, but this is the only festival which goes according to the state of the Sun. So this is how Sūrya Nārāyaṇa [The Sun God] has much importance in our country. People go to take [a] dip in the Ganges River and perform different types of worships. However this day is very significant.</b><br>
We have to decide as to what is to be done on this day, what work is to be performed. We bow before the Sun, offer [make] offerings and express our gratitude lo it. But what special work we could do, particularly the Sahaj Yogis?<br>
The Sun has its place at the Āgñyā chakra. You all know it, and think of the future with your Āgñyā chakra. So it is very essential to set the Āgñyā chakra right because it affects the Sun. The impact of the Āgñyā chakra is that with it we get angry with the people, start misbehaving with them, get enraged and all the faith is shaken. Āgñyā is very significant area which we must know about. II is the place of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ told us to forgive everyone. Forgiveness is very essential. But how to forgive? Many people say that we wish to forgive but we are unable to. To forgive one has to be forgiving. One has lo think that everyone will have to face his deeds. What have we to do with it? What one says will recoil back on him, why have we to get involved? With such detachment if you forgive everyone, then the Āgñyā chakra will be all right. Obstruction in the Āgñyā chakra stops the Kuṇḍalinī to ascend and to remove this obstruction we should know how to forgive. Every moment we keep on thinking as to who has tortured us and how. Instead we should think that we have to forgive. <b>The moment we forgive, you will be surprised, the Kuṇḍalinī ascends immediately. Our purpose is to raise our Kuṇḍalinī, why should we be angry? Getting angry is human nature, not divine, it is human nature.</b>"</font><br>

"<b>So today is a great day. This saṅkramaṇa that has started requires serious effort. We cannot play about with that. It's very great emergency. I can feel in the atmosphere the emergency. All the Gods and Goddesses are there to help you to work it out. You are in ... on the stage and you have to create that great drama of revolution.<br>
We have to show to this world that it's only the Spirit that can save the world, nothing else. And so, from today we start our journey towards that subtlety and that sensitivity, which you can feel, with which you can feel Nirānanda. Nirānanda, your Mother's name is Nirā, and at Sahasrāra you feel the ānanda, the joy of Nirā.<br>
May God bless you all.</b>"<br>
