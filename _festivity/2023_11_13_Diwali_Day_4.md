<font color="DarkRed">"Now the Mahālakṣhmī. <b>Mahālakṣhmī is the evolutionary state.</b> In the evolutionary state, when the evolutionary state starts, then the Mahālakṣhmī starts asserting Herself and that comes when your well-being is established fully. I mean, if you are still worried as to how to get a cup of tea for yourself, you cannot get to Mahālakṣhmī state.<br>
So, once that is little bit established and you feel that peace within yourself and that dignity, then the Mahālakṣhmī's Power starts acting on you. And the Mahālakṣhmī Power is that it really makes you the light. You have now become the light. Don't have to have any lights. You are the light. When you go anywhere, when people see you they take guidance from you. They use you as a torch which guides them. They will come and consult you and ask you how to do it. It is you who are the light.<br>
So, this is what it is. <b>One has to know that Mahālakṣhmī Tattwa is represented here as the light. And, you see these lights when enlightened, even a small light, how it reacts and how it shows. And now, you have become the light, you see. Even this light can do it. You see, I put My hand to it and it recognizes and knows that because it is now enlightened. It is put before the Photograph, it's enlightened. It works that way. Now what about you? You are the light now; you are the Diwālī of God.<br>
Diwālī means the, the rows of lights. So, you are going to make this beautiful mansion of God full of Diwālī light. You have entered into the Kingdom of God and you have to enlighten it. So you are the decoration of God on one side, you are the glory of God and also, on the other side you are the guide, guidelines</b> - you are like the torches, you can say, you are like the, what you call them, which are used by ships those ...<br>
......<br>
You have to become lighthouses."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"...... <b>Mahālakṣhmī gives us dignity. And that's how we start understanding the value of human dignity</b>. We should have also the idea of human dignity that we cannot insult human dignity, like people who are nagging others all the time. It's against or all the time asserting themselves about something making everybody's life miserable. It's against human dignity. You have to decorate another human, you have to make it beautiful, you have to make it enjoyable and happy, make everyone happy, not to nag all the time. And if you nag that's not a Gṛuhalakṣhmī; that is not a Gṛuhalakṣhmī. You should not nag, `Do this, do that, stand up, what are you doing, stand this side, do, go that side.' It's all a nonsense. You leave the person to be; <b>the human dignity is the most important thing</b>. But respect everybody. And that's possible because now you have the Mahālakṣhmī Principle. Those who do not have the dignity also will get it from you because you are dignified now. "</font><br>

<font color="Orchid">"<b>Satya Lakṣhmī. That is, that you get the awareness of Truth</b>, but apart from that, the awareness of Truth is there but to put the Truth forward in a gracious manner. Not to, `Now this is the Truth -- have it!' -- Not like that! You don't have to hit people with the Truth, you have to put it in a flower and give it to them. <b>That is Satya Lakṣhmī.</b> Of course, the all Lakṣhmī Tattwas are the parasympathetic powers within us but they are actually expressed in our brain. <b>Brain is the Virāṭa, is the Viṣhṇu when He becomes the Virāṭ, the Akbar.</b> So all His Powers, are, specially these powers, are in the brain. So, the brain itself spontaneously behaves in such a manner that people think that this is a special type of a personality.</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Eh ... <b>is the day of Mahālakṣhmī Pūjā nights, not only of Lakṣhmī Pūjā</b>. There's a difference between the two.<br>
Mahālakṣhmī is one of the powers of the Three Powers, Main Powers, of Ādi Śhakti. As you know Mahālakṣhmī, Mahāsaraswatī, Mahākālī. Now these powers have powers at a material level also, at a subtler level also. So Mahālakṣhmī Power is achieved after Lakṣhmī Power ......"</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So the whole idea of celebrating today the Lakṣhmī's Day is to understand that in us She has become the Mahālakṣhmī.</b> By that we have so many powers of which we are not aware, I mean we do not know that we are realized Souls. Some of us, we do not know and that we have those powers within us that we can permeate into others. We can project our personalities to others. We can find out what's wrong with them. We can find out about ourselves. We can go into ourselves, we can go into -- our permeation is like water is moving, is flowing all the time. And this is a very important thing that we should be aware of: our powers that we have achieved.<br>
Then we will start respecting ourselves then the Rājalakṣhmī comes in and then the Gṛuhalakṣhmī comes in and everything comes within when we become aware of what we have achieved of our self-esteem, of our dignity.<br>
So it gives us dignity, Mahālakṣhmī gives us dignity. And that's how we start understanding the value of human dignity.<br> 
We should have also the idea of human dignity that we cannot insult human dignity, like people who are nagging others all the time. It's against or all the time asserting themselves about something making everybody's life miserable. It's against human dignity. You have to decorate another human, you have to make it beautiful, you have to make it enjoyable and happy, make everyone happy, not to nag all the time."</font><br>

<font color="Orchid">"<b>Yoga Lakṣhmī. The Lakṣhmī's power which gives you Yoga. Is Lakṣhmī [who] supports your power of Yoga by giving you awareness. The power by which you take to Yoga is all combined as Yoga Lakṣhmī.</b><br>
Like your affluence: you are not satisfied and you want to have Yoga. The dissatisfaction you get till you have got Yoga is coming from the Yoga Lakṣhmī.<br>
<b>So, Yoga Lakṣhmī is: the power which gives you or takes you to your grace, by which you go to Yoga. That's Yoga Lakṣhmī. Means the kind of a satisfaction that you seek is manifested in you through this power of Yoga Lakṣhmī.</b><br>
And then once you have achieved your Yoga, you get the Grace. Lakṣhmī is the Grace. So, you get the grace of a Saint.<br>
You should have the grace of a Saint. You should look like a Saint! You are a Saint! I think better write it on your mirrors: ``We are Saints. We are `Men of God.' We have to behave like Saints. We are Saints." You are! No doubt! You are, "Men of God," no doubt, but you have turn your faces this way.<br>
So, this is the Yoga Lakṣhmī.<br>
For example, a person who has got Yoga Lakṣhmī doesn't quarrel like a madcap. If he quarrels or dominates someone in a foolish way, then he's still lacking that Lakṣhmī point. There's a grace about it: whole way of talking and ... How you talk to a Saint?"</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="Red">"...... [in] Sahaja Yoga we believe that the Lakṣhmī must became [become] Mahālakṣhmī. A man has to become greater man: mahā mānav. What does that mean? That She has to become the Mahālakṣhmī.<br>
<b>Mahālakṣhmī is a Deity which makes you absolutely satisfied with whatever you have. Complete satisfaction.</b><br>
......<br>
...... when the Mahālakṣhmī Principle shines in you, then you do not want any more. You want to give it to others, and you want to enjoy your generosity. That is the first sign that you are moving now from Lakṣhmī to Mahālakṣhmī. "</font><br>
