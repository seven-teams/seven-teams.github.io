<font color="DarkRed">"Now Diwālī has the significance that on Diwālī Day, what we do, we put lights all over. So that we put Sahaja Yoga everywhere. But does the light know about itself? Does the candle knows about itself?<br>
She enlightens everything but she doesn’t know. Like the moon, which is giving moonlight, does it know itself? Does he enjoy? Nothing. In the same way, it happens that on a Diwālī Day you are – what you are doing – is enlightening people, you are enlightening them, you are doing all this for them, it’s a good idea.<br>
You must do it. But also know that you have to become the lamp yourself which doesn’t know yourself. So there are two messages. The first one is that we have to enlighten the world, we have to enlighten others. This is the first one. Then we have to become that which is the light itself and light itself doesn’t know."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Now today is the Pūjā – as you know there are five days they celebrate Diwālī. The first day is the thirteenth day where it is the gṛuhalakṣhmī’s day, that is the day when the gṛuhalakṣhmī is worshiped. But a gṛuhalakṣhmī has to be worthy of the worship, and then some utensil is given to the gṛuhalakṣhmī. Some sort of a utensil is to be given to the gṛuhalakṣhmī as a present. That is the day Lakṣhmī was born, Lakṣhmī was born out of the Mother Earth. Out of the, we should say, Mother Earth but She came out of the sea after the churning, so that is the birth of the Lakṣhmī. She’s the giver of wealth, wealth which is material as well as spiritual."</font><br>

<font color="BlueViolet">"Gṛuhalakṣhmī is the Deity of the Family, the one who’s the Deity of the Family ...... <br>
The Deity of the Household, if She resides in you, then you are Gṛuhalakṣhmī, otherwise you are not."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"The first day of Diwālī is called as ‘Dhanatrayodaśhī’, is the thirteenth day of the Moon. Because that day is the first day when Lakṣhmī, the first ... was born on the thirteenth day. That means She was born as a Gṛuhalakṣhmī, as a housewife. Now there are eight Lakṣhmīs, which she will read it now and I will tell you later on what is the meaning of them. Just one of them is Gṛuhalakṣhmī.<br>
So the first is the form of a Gṛuhalakṣhmī. She is born as a Gṛuhalakṣhmī to begin with. That means the awareness of human beings also, started really getting into evolutionary process when they started their family life. When they were vagabonds moving about, then the awareness was just like animals. Though they had become human beings, but they were like animals. Then when they established their families, then the Gṛuhalakṣhmī started working and that’s how the first Advent of Gṛuhalakṣhmī was felt. So She is the first Lakṣhmī who was born, and that’s why on that thirteenth day is the day of the Gṛuhalakṣhmī, of the housewife. And so one has to go in the market and buy some utensil or something that she uses for cooking in the house. In India on the thirteenth day, everyone goes and buys a pot or say ... we can say,
what you call, a cooking utensil or something. Or they may buy a sāṛī or something or gold or something for the gṛuhalakṣhmī. That is the day of the housewife. So, to reach the Lakṣhmī one has to understand that motherhood is very important. The motherhood as a gṛuhalakṣhmī is important."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today women have gone weaker so the men have also become weak and powerless. Till the purity and loving mother like qualities develop in a woman the Gṛuhalakṣhmī Śhakti does not get awakened in her. But she should be wise. Gṛuhalakṣhmī has to be wise and intelligent. So we can say that when this Mahākālī Śhakti gets cool and peaceful it becomes Gṛuhalakṣhmī.
We believe in the Power of Fāṭimah as perfect Gṛuhalakṣhmī and she should sit on the Throne of Gṛuhalakṣhmī. By this Power of Mahākālī a woman can correct her children. She keeps her character pure and we are witness that the pativrata, women’s devotion towards her husband cannot be destroyed by anything because it is her śhakti. People and negativities are afraid of pativratā women. Also, the husbands should understand that the power within them is from the śhakti, their wife."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So the ladies of these place have to be good housewives, it’s very important. They have to be the Gṛuhalakṣhmīs. The one who is the Goddess of the household.
...And Gṛuhalakṣhmī is a very powerful institution. In India it is regarded as the highest, in a way. More than any prime minister or more than any highest position. The Gṛuhalakṣhmī’s position in the spirituality is regarded as the highest. Because, you see that it is said that a Satī, a Gṛuhalakṣhmī is higher than Yatis, Yatis is means are realized Souls of a very high level, Avadhūtas.<br>
......<br>
Women as in you know that we call them is the embodiment of śhaktis. But the Gṛuhalakṣhmī is the most powerful Śhakti. And She is the power of tremendous love, and compassion and forgiveness."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"...... there are Nine Lakṣhmīs which are described, navadhā, nine, which get completely manifested in a human being. One of them as we call as Gṛuhalakṣhmī. Gṛuhalakṣhmī means the family. The wife becomes a very wonderful person.<br>
She doesn’t object to things, she doesn’t react, but she’s very sensible and she builds up all her children in a beautiful manner. On the contrary, where she is not a Gṛuhalakṣhmī, she takes pride in working out something like men. [This] means – to her, her job is important, her bank balance is important. But the real bank balance of a Gṛuhalakṣhmī is her family and her children. If she doesn’t have that, she will be just thinking that she is very great, she can compete with this man or that man.<br>
Women don’t understand that their greatest capacity is to love. How is it that Lakṣhmī is a woman and all the Goddesses are women? And what is the quality of these Goddesses is to bestow blessings on people of their own nature, of their own qualities."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Because as I have said that that men and women are like two wheels of a chariot, one on the left, one on the right. The left cannot go to the right and right cannot go to the left. So we have to understand that our role is much more important than of the other. Like the men have an important role, as well as the women have even more important role. To be a mother itself is a very big thing. Why God has given you the motherhood? Because God thinks you are like the Mother Earth, that you look after, nourish the child, nourish the family, do all these things."</font><br>
