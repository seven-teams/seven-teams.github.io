<font color="DarkRed">"Then the day of the New Year comes in afterwards, because in India in the north, that's the time people finish their crops and they found that day was very good to celebrate the New Year. And, that is actually more, sort of, we can say is a social thing in India, we need not use that, what ever suits us. You can have your own New Year. Because in the south, say in Maharashtra they have another New Year, as I told you where Śhālivāhana in his dynasty started another calendar and they celebrate that.<br>
So all these things are nothing is rigid about anything, one must know. Nothing is rigid. Rigidity comes from ignorance.<br>
It's all for you, for your joy and happiness. <b>The whole festival system is for your happiness and not for the happiness of the time or date. It's for you, so it should be adjustable according to your needs and understanding. And also according to your national way you live. They should be no addiction to any particular type of culture, a particular type of ideas. It's all for you. All these festivals are for you, not for Gods. They don't have these festivals. It's only for you people these festivals are there. And when you celebrate them, that's only for your joy and your happiness. And that's how you should celebrate in a way that gives you the greatest amount of happiness. And the festivals, all the festivals of the world must be celebrated. The more you are festive, the happier it is.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Eh ... <b>is the day of Mahālakṣhmī Pūjā nights, not only of Lakṣhmī Pūjā</b<. There's a difference between the two.<br>
Mahālakṣhmī is one of the powers of the Three Powers, Main Powers, of Ādi Śhakti. As you know Mahālakṣhmī, Mahāsaraswatī, Mahākālī.<br>
Now these powers have powers at a material level also, at a subtler level also. So Mahālakṣhmī Power is achieved after Lakṣhmī Power, as they say."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today, we are going to worship the Mahālakṣhmī which I think is very much worshiped in this country where they worship Her as Maria and also there's a swayambhu of Maria, ......<br>
<b>This is the principle by which you have risen to this state. The central path of your ascent is created by Mahālakṣhmī Power for the Kuṇḍalinī to rise.</b><br>
......<br>
Coming to the point of Mahālakṣhmī, we have to understand what does it do, what its help is that this Mahālakṣhmī channel or the Mahālakṣhmī's Powers have created within us a proper balance, a proper route for Kuṇḍalinī to rise.<br>
Left and right has been balanced and She is the one who creates and makes a wider Path for Kuṇḍalinī to rise. This is the Path of Compassion and Love.<br>
Through that compassion and love She creates this Path because She knows that if the Path is not wide enough the Kuṇḍalinī cannot rise. Ultimately, one reaches a state where you start seeking and when you start seeking, your Mahālakṣhmī Principle has been awakened. That is awakened and sometimes it is very strong. Then you start seeking in a mad way. I am sorry to say that many are already lost in seeking, but there are so many who have now come to the right path and to the right ascent."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"...... <b>Mahālakṣhmī gives us dignity. And that's how we start understanding the value of human dignity.</b><br> 
We should have also the idea of human dignity that we cannot insult human dignity, like people who are nagging others all the time. It's against or all the time asserting themselves about something making everybody's life miserable. It's against human dignity. You have to decorate another human, you have to make it beautiful, you have to make it enjoyable and happy, make everyone happy, not to nag all the time. And if you nag that's not a Gṛuhalakṣhmī; that is not a Gṛuhalakṣhmī. You should not nag, `Do this, do that, stand up, what are you doing, stand this side, do, go that side.' It's all a nonsense. You leave the person to be; <b>the human dignity is the most important thing</b>. But respect everybody. And that's possible because now you have the Mahālakṣhmī Principle. Those who do not have the dignity also will get it from you because you are dignified now."</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So what is the Principle of Mahālakṣhmī? Is that first is of sacrifice.</b><br>
Sacrifice their own children on the Altar of Truth. Of course that is not needed in Sahaja Yoga. You are all blessed people, you don't have to sacrifice anything whatsoever. But if you do not develop your children into proper ways, they will hold you responsible and they will say, "Why did you not give us a full scope to develop?"<br>
......<br>
So this Mahālakṣhmī Principle has to grow among men, as well as in women. We have families now and this has to work out, that, do the whole family people sit down and meditate? Do we teach our children the proper protocol of Śhrī Mātājī? Like a lady bringing a perambulator in the hall -- is absurd! I mean, can you bring a perambulator in the church? This is more than a church. Do you realize whom are you facing? <b>And this is what you have to tell your children because this is the greatest time. This is the greatest time when you are here, the greatest time of spirituality, of the complete manifestation of the Powers of the Goddess, where your children have to be the real flowers of beauty.</b< Please don't try to cover them up with their souls dying out there under the cover of so-called love for them.
