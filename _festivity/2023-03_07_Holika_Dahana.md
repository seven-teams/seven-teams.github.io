<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, the great day of Holikā Dahana</b>, where the symbolism of this occasion is that the satanic forces were burnt by the innocence of Prahlāda. And that is what we have to remember, that when the Sahaja Yogis take to innocence and complete dependence on to their vibratory awareness, which is the indication of God’s Manifestation through them, they are completely protected, and even a satanic person like Holikā could not burn him [them].<br>
And this is the day today, we have to recognize that, as Sahaja Yogis, we stand no dangers in life. We are fearless people, but we are humble people, loving people, and anxious to save as many as possible. To raise the whole humanity into another awareness, in the process of your evolution, you have to achieve ghaṭ, for which you have to work hard."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"Sahaja Yogis all over the world are doing very important work. They are doing very vital work of God of giving Self-realization. This is the need in this Time of Resurrection.<br> 
Everyone must help in every way possible to deepen and expand the experience of Divinity so that all the human race could be saved and glorified as the great children of God Almighty."</b></font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkGreen">"Śhrī Rāma incarnated before Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. He was Maryādā Puruṣhottama and as such lived a very austere life. As a result of the austerities practiced by the King Himself, the whole society turned sober and serious. The element of joy and gaiety was completely missing. In Dwāpara Yuga, when Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa incarnated, He wanted to put an end to this extreme seriousness prevalent in the society. He thought of having a festival in which everyone could laugh heartily and have fun and joy. So the festival of color Holī, was started with this purpose. People, however, took undue liberties and misused the festival to the extent of defaming it. I had also to tell that “I do not play Holī at all.”<br>
The myth behind it is that there was a demoness named Holikā. She was the sister of Hiraṇyakaśhipu, the father of Prahlāda. Since Prahlāda was the devotee of Lord Viṣhṇu, his father, the demon king, used to harass and trouble him. Hiraṇyakaśhipu wanted to kill Prahlāda. Holikā had the boon that fire won’t burn her. Hiraṇyakaśhipu asked Holikā to take the boy Prahlāda in her lap and sit on the burning pyre, thinking that she could not be burnt. But to his surprise Holikā was burnt to ashes and no harm done to the child devotee of Śhrī Viṣhṇu! It was a significant incident which proved that it is sin to be cruel, arrogant and aggressive. Despite her boon, Holikā was burnt down and no harm done to the innocent child – devotee!<br>
Such is the myth and traditionally we burn Holī every year. There lies a lot of truthfulness in all our traditions. We have to understand that misdeeds, cruelties and troubling others are evil tendencies. Right-sided people develop these devilish traits in them. We should not allow such thoughts to dominate our brains and should give no significance to them. We should love all. It is very important to understand otherwise we shall all be demonic like Holikā. Now right-sided people develop this problem. It is a big lesson for them. No harm was done to the innocent child Prahlāda. God Almighty saved him, but this demonic woman, who got a boon as a result of her severe penance was reduced to ashes. One should understand that all these demonic tendencies are destructive. We should give them up and be generous and loving towards all. Quarreling and fighting with each other are not virtues. These are demonic tendencies.<br>
We should not take to these evil traits, we are Sahaja Yogis. <b>We are special people, we have incarnated to change this world, to transform it completely. We should put our attention on that. We are very highly placed, higher than all others. We have to save this world from falling to these tendencies.</b> These are much in vogue these days. It is unworthy to say these abhorrent things and to be cruel and dominate others. It is unnecessary in Sahaja Yoga.<br>
You are powerful enough. You have such powers within you that if someone endeavors to trouble you, you will be protected like Prahlāda. No one could destroy you. You are so much protected! No such thing could destroy you."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"You should have faith in God that is the main thing which people don’t understand what it means to have faith in God. 
That He is almighty, He does everything, He looks after everything, why should we worry?"</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>As you know, on the Day of Holī, Holikā was burnt.</b> Agni [God of Fire] had a very big blessing and task, because Agni Devatā had given Holikā a boon that in any circumstance, she will not burn, that death could come to her in any form, but not by fire. And after giving this boon, he regretted a lot because she took Prahlād in her lap and sat in the fire. And Agni Devatā had a big dilemma, that ``I have given this promise to her, that I will not burn her and how can I fulfill this promise? <b>And Prahlād, is Himself innocence personified, He is Himself an Incarnation of Śhrī Gaṇeśha</b> and how can I burn Him? Nobody can burn Him. And He is also beyond my powers. He is formed from my power." So he thought, ``What is this ego? that in front of such a Great Power what can I talk about my power? I have no such power which can face Him. His Power is so great that I cannot burn Him whatsoever I may try. But at this time I have a very big dilemma in front of me.""</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"I think we have had a nice time in this Holī, and we should always have such a nice time. Always with Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa’s blessings, you all should enjoy your Holī. But the greatest Holī is within yourself when you fill yourself with all kinds of colors.<br>
Your nature should be such that everybody should enjoy that color. That color that is within you, color of beauty – not artificial, just showing off, just giving something without any love."</b></font><br>

<font color="MediumPurple">"Then the</font> <b>colors</b> are, the <font color="brown">colors</font> <font color="MediumPurple"><b>are all representing your chakras</b>. These are all the chakras as you know. Every chakra has</font> got <font color="MediumPurple">a</font> different color. <font color="MediumPurple">So what happens? These colors just get distributed in the air, in the atmosphere. During Holi time you [Unclear know you] are representing those colors which are completely permeating into the atmosphere. So this is another thing when you play colors. When you color another person, you are just expressing that these, your chakras will be blessed.</font> <font color="DarkRed"><b>Red color is of the Mūlādhāra.</b></font> <font color="MediumPurple">All those colors that you use here are of different chakras. So just you are making the whole expression of your love that let it be you become completely filled with red color, means innocence, means innocence. Because as a child in the womb of the mother just sees the red color of the mother, color of the blood.</font><br>
<font color="MediumPurple">So like that, you see different colors are spread on the face. And</font> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>abhira is the green color of the Guru Tattwa</b>.</font> <font color="MediumPurple">Like that all these colors have got significance that they are the colors of your chakras which you are spreading all over to your friends, to your other brothers and sisters who are Sahaja Yogis. So it has that symbolic expression that you are spreading your – actually the essence of your chakra, the basis of your chakra,</font> <font color="bluee">the colors of your chakra, the fragrance of those chakras to other Sahaja Yogis.</font><br>
<font color="MediumPurple">You just permeate, permeating. I don’t know in Hindi language if there is a better word like in Marathi ‘ud-har’, udahr. ‘Udhar’ means just ... [Hindi.]<br>
...</font> <font color="DarkRed">red color, is the sign of innocence.</font> <font color="MediumPurple">So Kabīra</font> says that, <font color="MediumPurple">“You put me into such a color. Oh, the one who is going to color me is the One.” Rangaraj is the one who colors things. So He says, “Oh Rangaraj, make me so that the whole thing becomes red – innocence, fills me up with complete innocence.” And innocence is the one he has asked for to be filled in. And same is with Shrī Kṛiṣhṇa that He played with all these different colors to show that there are different</font> chakras <font color="MediumPurple">within us apart from the red and the others that are there. All of them play a part to create a beautiful joyful personality."</font><br>
