<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are going to celebrate the birthday of Mahāvīra.</b><br>
Mahāvīra is the Incarnation of Bhairavanāth, or you call Him as Saint Michael. Now these two Saints as you know one as the Gabriel, Hanumāna, and another is Saint Michael. One is placed on the Piṅgalā nāḍī and another one, Saint Michael, on the Iḍā nāḍī."</font><br>

<b>Auṃ Twameva sākṣhāt Śhrī Mahāvīra sākṣhāt Śhrī Ādi Śhakti Mātājī Śhrī Nirmalā Devī namo namaḥ!</b><br>
O Divine Mother, You are verily Śhrī Mahāvīra! Salutations to You! 
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>In Sahaj we very much respect and understand Mahāvīrjī and we also accept that He is the Incarnation of Śhrī Bhairavnāth and not only this he took birth many times and later also came as Hasan and Husayn.</b><br>
In Bible, Bhiaravnāthjī is addressed as Saint George and some refer him as Saint Michael. It is very surprising that London which we understand as Heart has Saint George as its angel. That is! They accept Bhairavnāth so it’s correct. Because if Śhivjī resides in heart then having Bhairavnāth is important. There are so many things which if we read with understanding then they are all interconnected and how is their relation automatically established. In Sahaj Śhakti you get overwhelmed and you enjoy it and this makes Me happy. God has created this universe for you so you should enjoy it, what else do you want. In you, there are many powers and you use them and you have also shared it with others. In this way, the family of our Sahaj should grow. We should save as many possible, most important our children. We should take care of them because a wrong type of culture has started and the children are getting affected. So we should pay attention to it and to them and take care of them. When they are established in Sahaj then they will not go around."</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">So we have to thank really very much Mahāvīra, who has given us this power to remove our left-sided problems, who has given us this light in our hand, which He Himself vibrates and He Himself tries to throw some light on the obscure things about Me also. Because of Him only, we can get cured of so many physical and mental troubles.<br>
<b>You know that the left side can be easily cured if you use three-candle treatment. That shows Mahāvīra is only fond of light. He doesn't like darkness</b> and His idea is, I think that way, is to now fully go all the way to clear the left side as far as possible, to help Sahaja Yoga to establish in countries where I find still lot of this negativity is there -- a lot of it. </font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"The ascetic life of Mahāvīra was of a very, very extreme nature. He was the one who was born in a ... uh ... clan of warriors, Kṣhatriyas. And then He was also married, also He had a daughter. And then He decided, because He knew He had to do the work of the Divine, He decided to take a saṃnyāsa. So He took uh the permission of His brother because His parents were dead. He was a king, so He gave up all His uh material wealth, everything and He beg ... became a complete saṃnyāsī. And the He left His family, His left His ... house, everything behind and went alone with a little bowl for begging alms. And there people who joined Him were very few, and He asked them that, ``You have to also become ascetics," Munis.<br>
He was a Reincarnation of Saint Michael and He resides on the left side, on the Iḍā nāḍī. And He looks after the whole of it, right from Mūlādhāra onwards up to the Sahasrāra. <b>So Saint Michael was born as Mahāvīra, meaning The Greatest Warrior. But when He was born, the whole place got lot of uh prosperity, that's why He was called as Vardhamān, to begin with.</b><br>
But His asceticism was there because of the Brahminism that was so prevalent in those days, and people were absolutely drowned into it. "</font><br>

<b>Auṃ Twameva sākṣhāt Śhrī Vardhamāna sākṣhāt Śhrī Ādi Śhakti Mātājī Śhrī Nirmalā Devī namo namaḥ!</b><br>
O Divine Mother, You are verily the One who makes us progress and evolve! Salutations to You!

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Now Mahāvīra also was one of them, who was born again and again and he was Mārkaṇḍeya and he was Kabīra, the way Kabīra lashes people you can see that he is tremendous, he is like Bhairava and the Power of Bhairava, Kabīra has used in his language, but for Hindi poets it is Sadhukaddi [vernacular dialect of Hindi+Punjabi+Māravāṛī in medieval North India] and they have made fun of it."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So today I am saying this, <b>that this left side which is music, art which has this emotions (bhāvanā) shows it.</b><br>
Even though Saraswatī has created all the Swaras, so what!<br>
but the emotions it contains, the bhakti it contains it is due to the blessings of Mahāvīr.<br>
Mahāvīr has really worked hard for this because he scared people that if you go to the wrong way,<br>
you go to hell, and on taking this correct way you will be overwhelmed and you all are actually witnessing it.<br>
Like this, we all should increase our bhakti and growing bhakti in the work of Mahāvīr."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Sahaj Yoga is not just for you. It is meant for the whole world.</b> It is not just for spirituality but to establish spirituality into this world.  Like Kabīr Dās has said, “Mann mamta ,” means "Left side, I will mix that in the five elements".  Means right side. The five elements are in the right side and “Man mamta” on the left.  I will mix this into that." This is the thing. That whatever are our feelings are and whatever our art is, we will mix it into the five elements."</font><br>
