<font color="DarkRed">"Christ’s work was very unique. The whole thing was a very unique thing, was planned in such a manner that He was to be born in a place, because was very humble, very humble place. Because He came to teach us humility. The word teaching in English language means telling about it, talking about it.<br>
But when I say ‘teach’, I mean create, you activate within us humility.<br>
Actually He came on this Earth, first of all, to create a space within us, at the Āgñyā chakra, by removing the hurdles of the ego, hurdles of the ego. He had to talk of humility that time, because Romans were ruling and they were very arrogant, very crude, uncouth, underdeveloped, we should say, not at all evolved."</font><br>

<b>You are the forgiver.<br>
You allow us to forgive.<br>
You are the Spirit.<br>
You are born of the Spirit.</b>

<font color="DarkRed">"Christ life is a symbolically, can be called as the Symbol of Purity and Holiness, He was purity and Holiness. When we talk of purity we may think about outside purity, of maybe the purity of out writings or talking or maybe we are very sophisticated of we talk very sweetly, or were very kind, but Christ was pure in the sense that he was nothing but purity and he went to this extent of purity, that he said that: “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes,” that your eyes have to be pure, even up to the eyes. He said: “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes,” so the lust and greed has to disappear from our personality if we have to follow Christ if we have to understand what an Incarnation of Holiness He was."</font><br>

<p style="color:DarkRed; text-align:center;">
<b>You are Lord Kārttikeya<br>
You are Śhrī Mahāgaṇeśha.<br>
You are the purity of innocence.<br> 
You are continence.<br>
You are generosity.</b><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today we came to Gaṇapatīpuḷe, it has a great significance, among the Aṣhṭavināyak [eight swayambhus of Śhrī Gaṇeśha]. It is the place of Mahāgaṇeśha. Mahāgaṇeśha is Pīṭhadiśh [Governor of all Pīṭhas] and sitting on this Pīṭha, he looks after [protects] all the Gaṇeśha Swayambhus. He has the knowledge of all the Auṃkāras, as he has attained the Guru Tattwa [Guru Principle].<br>
If we see in the surroundings, the ocean, so beautiful and clean is washing the feet of this Gaṇapati, because the ocean represents the Guru Tattwa, and with that Guru Tattwa, he washes the feet of Śhrī Gaṇeśha and that is how it should happen with all the Sahaja Yogis. Gaṇeśha Stuti is done and then Śhrī Gaṇeśha is established and thereafter with the Mahālakṣhmī Tattwa you have to become Mahāgaṇeśhas.<br>
......<br>
Whatever thing you see, you should be able to go into thoughtless awareness, especially when one sees the Devīs and Devatās [Gods and Goddesses], who reside in the heavenly abode of wealth and prosperity.<br>
Once we attain the state of thoughtless awareness, no perversion will remain in our attention anymore."</font><br>

<p>
In words of Khalil Gibran, `The Crucified':<br>
<font size="-1"><font color="DarkRed">Jesus never lived a life of fear, nor did He die suffering or complaining...
He lived as a leader. He was crucified as a crusader...
Jesus was not sent here to teach the people to build magnificent churches and temples amidst the cold wretched huts and dismal hovels...
He came to make the human heart a temple, and the soul an altar, and the mind a priest.</font></font><br>
