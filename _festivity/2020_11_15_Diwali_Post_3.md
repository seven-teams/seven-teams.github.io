<font color="DarkRed">"How I give you Second Birth you know very well. I conceive you in My heart, otherwise I cannot do it. Because My heart is so pure, it cleanses you, My compassion, My love cleanses you, and then I can take you out of My Sahasrāra, otherwise, how will I do that? And when that is happened you have become a new personality.<br>
So you are very different from all others because a Spirit has given birth to your Spirit. You have been cleansed by the Spirit. So you cannot live like that like all other human beings are living."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So today is a special day to celebrate the Kingdom of God on Earth. As we have ... used to pray “Thy kingdom come [......] on this earth” and it has come today on this mountain and we are here to celebrate the coming of the Kingdom of God as we have been praying for ages. And the <b>blessings of Kingdom of God is that you get drenched in joy – joy which has no duality, like happiness and unhappiness.</b> Is an experience of Absoluteness and just that joy is sufficient, you don’t want any food, you don’t want to sleep, you don’t mind where you are, just in joy drenched completely. There’s no place for unhappiness, we have no heart for it."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"It’s the day of Mahālakṣhmī Pūjā night, not only of Lakṣhmī Pūjā; there’s a difference between the two. Mahālakṣhmī is one of the powers of the Three Powers, Main Powers of Ādi Śhakti. As you know: Mahālakṣhmī, Mahāsaraswatī, Mahākālī. Now, these powers have powers at a material level also, at a subtler level also. <b>So Mahālakṣhmī Power is achieved after Lakṣhmī Power.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Mahālakṣhmī is an Incarnation of the Lakṣhmī, the Power of Viṣhṇu.</b> She only incarnated. This Mahālakṣhmī Principle is born out of the Lakṣhmī, who is the Power of Śhrī Viṣhṇu. When in a human being the desire to rise higher comes in, the Lakṣhmī Principle becomes the Mahālakṣhmī Principle."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So the whole idea of celebrating today the Lakṣhmī’s day is to understand that in us She has become the Mahālakṣhmī.</b> By that we have so many powers of which we are not aware, I mean we do not know that we are realized Souls. Some of us, we do not know and that we have those powers within us that we can permeate into others. We can project our personalities to others. We can find out what’s wrong with them. We can find out about ourselves.
We can go into ourselves, we can go into – our permeation is like water is moving, is flowing all the time.
And this is a very important thing that we should be aware of: our powers that we have achieved.
Mahālakṣhmī gives us dignity. And that’s how we start understanding the value of human dignity. We should have also the idea of human dignity that we cannot insult human dignity, like people who are nagging others all the time. It’s against or all the time asserting themselves
about something making everybody’s life miserable. It’s against human dignity. You have to decorate another human, you have to make it beautiful, you have to make it enjoyable and happy, make everyone happy, not to nag all the time."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"...... in Sahaja Yoga we believe that the Lakṣhmī must become Mahālakṣhmī. Man has to become greater man: mahā mānav. What does that mean?

...... when the Mahālakṣhmī Principle shines in you, then you do not want any more. <b>You want to give it to others and you want to enjoy your generosity. That is the first sign that you are moving now from Lakṣhmī to Mahālakṣhmī.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Then, <b>it has got two red, pink flowers in the hand, that are lotus flowers again.</b><br>
Now the lotus is regarded as a very holy flower in India, because it is so receptive to everything that is crude and funny.
First of all it is born in the mud. Just think of it, in the mud, in the filth, where the horrible smell is coming out, the lotus is born. 
And the one lotus gives the fragrance, the beautiful fragrance to the whole atmosphere, and kills all that’s filth and everything, and covers the whole pond with its big, big leaves so that it looks a beautiful pond. That’s what is the lotus for. But this lotus is a pink lotus, means pink, you know, is the sign of love.<br> 
<b>Pink is the sign of love. So such a person has to have tremendous love and that softness of the lotus.</b></font><br>
