<font color="DarkRed">"<b>On this auspicious occasion God Almighty has manifested all His śhaktis for your protection, benevolence and welfare. In everything God is blessing you. He wants to see you enter His Kingdom.</b> In a way it is His Desire that you should return to your Father's home and enjoy its comforts. But at least we should be worthy of it. If we are not worthy of it then how can we enter it? We should examine our worthiness and see what it is.<br>
The first thing is that you should come to your Father's house. Today I have also come to My Father's house. I feel like that because Himalaya is My Father. On coming here, I cannot express in words the feelings that are rising within Me, but I think that today I have found a great occasion to celebrate the glory of My Father. A great opportunity has come before Me to praise the glories of My Father and narrate the great achievements of those who meditated here. With the inspiration derived [received] from the Himalayas they rose from nowhere to such heights that they achieved the highest state.<br>
The Himalayas are the Sahasrāra that Mother Earth has created for you. This Sahasrāra is to be worshiped. This Sahasrāra is very great. I don't know if you can see vibrations emitting from it. I am completely engulfed by their vibrations that I cannot see anything else. There are only vibrations and vibrations. Nothing else."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Today is the first day of Navarātri. Today your attention should be on Śhrī Gaṇeśha.</b> His devotion is infinite. He has never worshiped anybody else except Mother. Hence He is so great. All other Gods appear very strong. Everyone has some specialty. What is Mother's specialty? Her ego (aham) is nowhere felt by others. Hence Śhrī Gaṇeśha who has surrendered to such Mother, is so wise and venerable, Mother has nothing with Her. Her very name begins with Ni, e.g., Niṣhakāñchan[ā] having no wealth, Nirlepā unaffected; Nirvichārā thoughtless; Niṣhprayojanā having no motives, Nigarvitā egoless, Niricchā desireless, etc. Therefore, surrendering to such Mother, who has nothing with Her, needs some kind of subtle thought, in that, Mother has nothing with Her and therefore, nothing can be asked from Her. It shows how Śhrī Gaṇeśha by Himself, is fully satisfied. Where does this contentment of Śhrī Gaṇeśha comes from? It is [His] own power."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>On this day Devī is worshiped as Śhailaputrī, means the daughter of Himalaya. Devī has many other names also but first of all She incarnated as Śhailaputrī in the cold of Himalayas.</b> She incarnated and whatever She was to do, She started there.<br>
Further story is known to you. [King] Dakṣha did not invite Lord Śhiva in the Havana that he performed and Śhailaputrī was the consort of Lord Śhiva. She is called Satī because She entered the Holy fire of Havana and ablated Herself. But by then Lord Śhiva reached there. He lifted Her burnt up body from the fire. Burnt pieces of the body of Śhailaputrī fell at many places. All these places are considered to be Śhakti Pīṭhas, the places of worship, as there is in Vindhyāchala and many other places. Her power moves there and it is said that it Sanctifies everything.<br>
Her seventh power is considered to be the Power of Destruction. Śhakti manifested Itself on the right side as Sāvitrī and Gāyatrī but the destroying force was manifested in the center.<br>
In the form of Durgā and Her other forms manifested in Heart chakra. She is present there.<br>
If some one hurts you, confuses or disturbs you then this power will protect you and destroy your enemy."</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">In the first and the second phase of evolution matter was created. At this point, Śhrī Ādi Śhakti separated from Śhrī Sadāśhiva and She created Lord Gaṇeśha to bless Her creation with innocence and auspiciousness. Hence, <b>the first prayer to the Goddess is addressed to Lord Gaṇeśha in the first night of the nine phases of the moon in the period of worship called Navarātri or nine nights of worship. Lord Gaṇeśha's Power removes all obstacles and also purifies us for undertaking the prayers to the Goddess</b>. The Blessings of the moon which is also on the left side, also arise from the same source. This is the stage of Mūlādhāra chakra in us.</font><br>
<font size="+0"><b>(Excerpt from the book '9 Nights of worship to the Goddess')</b></font>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Now let us see <b>the first chakra, belongs to the Power of Gaurī, the Power of the Mother of Śhrī Gaṇeśh. Gaurī's Power.</b> Tremendous they are, aren't they? Because of Her Power you have got your Realization.<br>
Now what have we done to enshrine that power within ourselves? Today, if it is the first day of Navarātri, let us see what have we done? Have we been able to develop our innocence within ourselves? When people talk, they are so sharp. How can you be sharp if you are innocent? They are so bumptious. How can you be that if you are innocent? People play games. How can you do that if you are innocent? Harm each other. How can it be, if you are innocent? So first of all you have to see yourself, that the power of innocence, if it has to live, all the rest of the nonsense has to go away. If you want to have the innocence, all that is anti-innocence has to be dropped out."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"In the first Advent of the Holy Ghost came on this Earth this day. That was about fourteen thousands years back. <b>And today is the day that is celebrated as the first Advent. And there are Nine Advents</b> She has had before She came as the Mahālakṣhmī. She first, today I will be telling you about it -- how She is placed within us, where She resides, what is Her work, how She protects us. I'll be today telling you on the Heart chakra. <b>And that's why today they celebrate this special day of Her worship.</b>"</font><br>
