<font color="DarkRed">"<b>This seminar, or whatever you may call it, Gaṇapatīpuḷe, I don't know what you call is a Divine Congregation of all the Gods and Goddesses, is very symbolic to Me, because this represents the whole world, it represents the problems of the whole world and also the solutions.</b> It's such a beautiful idea. I don't know how it worked into My head that I started this kind of a beautiful congregation to meet you all. It was very nice yesterday, you kept awake all the while and came to see Me. I could meet all of you and I could have some rapport. I couldn't say much, I was just smiling at you, but just I could express My Love and you gave Me that chance.<br>
I must thank you very much for that. "</font><br>

First the Śhrī Gaṇeśha and then the Guru must be worshiped. That’s why I came to the sea."</b></font><br>

<b>Rajesh Shah</b>: For our record. So You come on the beach the first time during this trip.<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī</b>:Yeah.<br>
See that. Sea’s the Father, is the Guru, and He must be worshiped. Before you do any Pūjā, Guru must be worshiped. <b>First, the Śhrī Gaṇeśha</b> [Śhrī Mahāgaṇeśha Pūjā the night before] <b>and then the Guru must be worshiped. That’s why I came to the sea.</b><br>
We all learned that you all have to worship the Sea and not to spoil things like this. You see, now: that’s not a good idea. You should never spoil a seashore. That’s your father’s añchal [shawl, zone], need not be spoilt. And, also, to wear funny dresses and misbehave in the presence of your Guru is inauspicious.
One should not do like that. But, I don’t know, how many understand the importance of the Sea. You should behave like this, the Sea goes angry, then you have lots of problems, like it may never be a sunny day for you to come to the Sea. Or maybe, on every holiday it will be a cloudy day. Or maybe, that the uh ... tankers might break and it will have all ... oil all over to spoil the beach. To spoil the beach you might invite the typhoons and you might have all the problems. Or on the Sea beach if you develop thinks like tobacco and all those ... harmful thinks, like alcohol, then the typhoon will come and break that.<br>
So one should be very careful, if you are on the seashore you have advantages, but the greatest disadvantage is that Guru is very powerful and extremely holy and auspicious, absolutely auspicious, So one has to be careful on that.<br>
Those who have eaten here or done these things are very wrong. They don’t understand what the Sea means.<br>
May God bless you.</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī</b></font>: Ishould say tonight is the Christmas eve and we are all here. We have to understand that now we have really entered into the area of Jerusalem and where you are built in such a way that we can understand the Great Incarnation of Christ. So far He was never understood because It was a very subtle Incarnation and that has made people go much away from Him, from the Principle of which He was made, the Innocence.
So today we have to remember how He incarnated on this Earth, the innocence, the auspiciousness which was filled by Ādi Śhakti to begin with when She started to create this universe, that He was the Embodiment of all that which was so necessary before the creation started.

Hark! The herald angels sing<br>
Glory to the new-born King<br>
Christ, by highest heaven adored<br>
Christ, the everlasting Lord<br>
Late in time behold Him come<br>
Offspring of a Virgin’s womb<br>
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see<br>
Hail the incarnate Deity<br>
Pleased as man with man to dwell<br>
Jesus, our Emmanuel!<br>
