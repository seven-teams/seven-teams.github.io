<font color="DarkGreen">"All of Them were created by Ādi Śhakti. All these Gurus were created by Her. And today I say that you all become as great as Guru Nāṇaka, as great as Moses, as great as Sāī Nāth, as great as Nāṇaka, Janaka, Muhammad. All [of you] have to become as great as all these Great Incarnations. Just desire, have earnestness in you and alertness to achieve it."</font><br>

<b><b>Ikoaŉkār saṯ nām karṯā purakẖ nirbẖa­o nirvair akāl mūraṯ ajūnī saibẖaŉ gur parsāḏ.</b><br>
There is One and only One God who is transcendent as well as immanent.<br>
True and Eternal Name. Creator and Person. Without Fear and without Enmity.<br>
Timeless Form, Unborn, Self-existent.<br>
Realized by Divine Grace.<br>"
Śhrī Guru Nāṇak's Mool mantra</b><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"Muhammad Sāhib Himself was born [again] as our Great Guru, Guru Nāṇaka. Guru Nāṇak was not a human being, He was not only a Paigambar [Prophet] but He was the Reincarnation of Ādi Guru, the Primordial Master, He was a Divine Personality. Of course, the people who were there at His time were so useless and gross people that they actually tortured His life and nobody followed Him. After His death is a different point. He also has said that it is the Primordial Mother who has created the Universe.</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Then came, you know Nāṇaka who preached that there should be no enmity between Hindus and Muslims, he preached that, because he saw the Muslims behaving in such a manner, they were such fanatics and they had become so funny that he could not understand how is it? These are the people whom I have made Muslims and what are they doing here? Actually Mussulman means the person who is realized and Pīr is a person whose Realization is established so much so that he said that those who have become Mussulman should be buried and not burnt, because he thought they are all realized Souls, but Realization finished off with his son-in-law and his daughter, after that he had two sons who were great Souls who are really the Reincarnation[s] of Lav and Kuśh.
