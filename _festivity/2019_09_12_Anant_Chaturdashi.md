<font color="DarkRed">"Firstly, in every place one has to establish Śhrī Gaṇeśha. Śhrī Gaṇeśha, as you know, is the Source of Auspiciousness, of Holiness, of Innocence and all these three things come from the wisdom of Śhrī Gaṇeśha. So first and foremost is the wisdom within you. With wisdom, you will know what is auspicious, what is holiness. This wisdom is not a worldly-wise wisdom but Divine Wisdom, which comes to us with our ascent. So the duty of every Sahaja Yogi is to establish this Source of Wisdom."</font><br>

Sahaja Yogi: Today it’s said it’s Anant Chaturdaśhī.<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b> Ah?</font><br>
Sahaja Yogi: Anant Chaturdaśhī.<br>
<font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b> Today? Ah-ah! That’s great! Yes must be. I was wondering Anant Chaturdaśhī. Anant Chaturdaśhī is the day when we ‘visarjan’ – dissolve Śhrī Gaṇeśha in the water.
Gaṇeśhjī ko chodte hai na pani mein – it’s that day we put the Gaṇeśha in to the water.<br>
Because He’s established for ten days and after ten days, He’s born on the fourth, after ten days He’s dissolved in the water so that everywhere His Power is spread through the water.
That’s why no wonder there was a Pūjā.<br>
Gaṇeśha settled down into the water. That is Ananta Chaturdaśhī. Ananta is the, is Śhrī Gaṇeśha.<br>
Ananta means which cannot be destroyed. Innocence cannot be destroyed. And that is why is the Gaṇeśh Chaturdaśhī means the day when Gaṇeśha is dissolved in the water, in the ocean or He is created, worshiped for ten days and again given back. So it’s a very great day today, I should say, like the Resurrection of Christ that you are, you had Christ here, He lived with you, and then went back to His Father. Father is the ocean and that’s what in India they do, establish Him on the fourth day and on the tenth day they put Him back to the ocean."</font><br>

<b>Ratna khachita pharā tuzla Gaurī Kumarā,</b><br>
Wearing gold ornaments studded with gems, You are Adi Shakti’s Son,<br>
<b>Chandanāchī utī kumkum keśharā,</b><br>
You are anointed with sandalwood paste, kumkum and saffron,<br>
The diamond-studded crown adds to Your beauty,<br>
<b>Rhūṇ-jhuṇtī nūpure charṇī ghāgariyā,</b><br>
The jingling anklets on Your Feet are making heavenly music.<br>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"...... Great thing about Śhrī Gaṇeśha is that, for Him no Gods exist except His Mother. And you know all the stories about Śhrī Gaṇeśh, how He adored His Mother. Because He knows His Mother is the Power; and that He is the source of your wisdom, He’s the Embodiment of Wisdom, and the Greatest Wisdom He has: that it is better to worship the Mother than anybody else, because She is the Power.<br>
According to Him, even the Father, if you have to meet, you have to go through the Mother, and secondly, Father is just the Witness. All His security, all His Powers, all His beauty, innocence, come from His Mother."</font><br>

<b>Lambodar pītāmbar phaṇi var.bandhanā,</b><br>
You have a big belly and wear a yellow silk dhoti and the sacred thread,<br>
<b>Saraḷ soṇḍa vakra tuṇḍa trinayanā,</b><br>
Your unusual face has a curved trunk and three eyes,<br>
<b>Dāas. Rāmāchā vāṭ pāhe sadanā,</b><br>
The servant of Śhrī Rāma is waiting for You in this house (body),<br>
<b>Sañkaṭi pāvāve, nirvāṇī rakṣhāve, suravar. vandanā,</b><br>
At times of problems You save us, from calamities, You protect us,<br> 
You who are worshipped as the Greatest of the Deities.<br>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Śhrī Gaṇeśha's blessings are very important for all the people who are specially prone to some sort of a hurdle or saṅkaṭa as they call it. He's called as Saṅkaṭa Vimochan: the one who takes you out of all the hurdles of life. So many of you have experienced how He has helped you in different troubles and hurdles and also different type of very, very difficult times.<br>
It is His style that He manages thing[s] so well because He is a Gaṇapati. Gaṇapati means: the One who is the Lord of the Gaṇas.<br>
As I have told you, gaṇas exist within us, very nicely settled down as uh these bodies, small, small bodies who report: if there's any problem, they report to the brain that there's a problem."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So now, when we deal with our children, we should know that they are just like Śhrī Gaṇeśh: they are very innocent, very simple, except in cases sometimes they are affected by some things and they lose their moorin... moorings.<br>
But Śhrī Gaṇeśha's greatest contribution to Sahaja Yoga is that He makes you feel My vibrations. He makes you feel the beauty of purity and simplicity. [It's] only possible if Śhrī Gaṇeśha is awakened within you. Also, the Kuṇḍalinī won't rise without the sanction of this Chancellor. He's the one sitting on Mūlādhāra. But you should know He is on every chakra. Innocence cures all the maladies: physical, mental, emotional, specially the spiritual one. But Śhrī Gaṇeśha's quality is the most important is: that He believes in emitting vibration[s], He believes in projecting His vibrations to everyone. That is the quality now I feel all of you, as Sahaja Yogis, can use."</font><br>
