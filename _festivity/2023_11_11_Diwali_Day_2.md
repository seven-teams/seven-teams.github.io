<font color="DarkRed">"So there are so many aspects for this that, after Rāma had killed Rāvaṇa, another satanic force, this Diwālī was celebrated. Also, this was celebrated much earlier, when Narakāsura [Tārakāsura] was killed. And this is how we express our joy and happiness, our gratitude to God that He has protected us always with His Power, with His Śhakti and has destroyed all the rākṣhasas and all the evil forces of this world.<br>
<b>This is the time of Thanksgiving. On this day we have to go to our elders and give thanks to them for whatever they have done for us. To all those people whom we have to give thanks, today is the day when we have to ask God to bless all these people.</b>"</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Then the fourteenth day is very important, because that is the day the Goddess as a power, as a power, because it was Kārttikeya who killed Narakāsura [Tārakāsura], the devil.</b> And he was one of the worst of all, could not be killed. So Śhiva and Pārvatī were married for this special purpose to produce this powerful Śhakti Putra, means the Son of the Śhakti, known as Kārttikeya. And He was just born to kill this horrible devil, called as Narakāsura [Tārakāsura]. And He killed. That is the day, fourteenth day. It is something like Halloween, that day. Because that is the day they opened the gates of hell and put all the devils into Hell."</font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Then there is, the second day is where Narakāsura [Tārakāsura] was killed. Now Narakāsura [Tārakāsura] was the one who was the devil from the Hell, let's say -- very cunning, very clever -- and he was killed by the Goddess. Actually he was killed by a, another Incarnation, Kārttikeya, but Goddess gave Him the power to kill. So when he was killed it was celebrated because the evil was killed. But we don't find that these days the evil people are getting peace awards. So what is the reason for this kind of a perverted brain? How is it they are using perversion? Just the opposite of it. What has worked out these things? So again we find the same so-called freedom to become also evil. So we have freedom to become evil. First of all we have freedom not to be benevolent, and secondly to become evil we have freedom.<br>
So <b>the Narakāsura [Tārakāsura] within us must be killed, the one which teaches us evil, to do evil to others. If you are busy doing evil to others you can never enjoy. Because you enjoy doing evil to others. So that has to be faced within ourselves, not in other people. It's very easy to say that this Sahaja Yogi is caught up, that Sahaja Yogi is like that, but very difficult to say, `Mother, I am caught up. I have got this problem within myself.' So when you start seeing yourself your heart opens out. Unless and until you learn how to open out your heart how can you enjoy? Open your heart.</b><br>
Many people live on very superficial level. All right, some of them might say that, `I am possessed, Mother. I've got this possession.' Why? `I've got this conditioning, that conditioning.' But why? You don't want to enjoy. So watch yourself, see for yourself. This is my conditioning, `All right, I'll put you right.' See in the mirror. Tell yourself, `This kind of a useless conditioning I've got it from where? Because I'm Indian, because I'm French, because of English.' Open the heart. And opening the heart is only possible if Narakāsura [Tārakāsura] sitting on your heart is killed, finished, once for all.<br>
In small, small things there is joy. In very little things also there's a ripple of joy. If you are sensitive you can catch it. And why not enjoy? Why to have these stupid conditioning on our heads for nothing at all that we can't enjoy? Enjoyment is only possible if you take out this one, sitting on your heart.<br>
<b>So that is the second part of the Diwālī that you have to open your heart.</b> Forget your nationality, forget your race, forget everything. It's a funny kind of things Sahaja Yogis have. They must be respected, they must be treated like this or maybe that we are something great and they are no good. If you cannot mix up with the collective it's something wrong with you. Nothing wrong with others. Easy to find faults with others. But what's the use? If you start finding faults with others you do not become clean."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Rājalakṣhmīs are the Goddesses who are looking after the country.</b><br>
Like England has a Rājalakṣhmī, too. Now, the, say, we can say the princess now is ... is a Rājalakṣhmī, he's a ... she's a woman with dignity, she carries herself with that bashful sweetness and all that, she's a Rājalakṣhmī.<br>
Our Queen is very good, too.<br>
......<br>
<b>A Rājalakṣhmī is a dignified woman: she is the one who is the glory of the country.</b> She has to be a glorious woman. She has to be a woman with all the attributes of a queen. And that is the Rājalakṣhmī: is the, is the queen, or the Goddess, that is the queen. And She resides in every country. Every country has a Gṛuhalakṣhmī."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Rājalakṣhmī is the one where collectively, collectively you enjoy your well-being</b>, collectively, on the right-hand side, you can say. Like, we have some places which are for public usage here, public well-being.<br>
......<br>
So, we have the essence of Lakṣhmī and then we have, when we evolved, we started having our homes, houses, our own family, our own private life, our this thing. So, we had Gṛuhalakṣhmī. And then we started having collective, like we can say the Queen represents here Rājalakṣhmī. The Queen represents here the Rājalakṣhmī of England. She is a symbol of that. Our Queen here is the symbol of that Rājalakṣhmī. You know, the word Rāj means the kingdom or you can say the royal, royal side of the -- regality. <b>So, when the Lakṣhmī is a regal Lakṣhmī, She is for collectivity. So, the Queen doesn't live for herself, she lives for all the Collective Being. In the same way, this Rājlakṣhmī is the One that is for all of us.</b><br>
For example, this place we got here is through the blessings of Rājlakṣhmī. She gave us.<br>
Her power gave us this place to live because you are all Sahaja Yogis. You are the epitome of the evolution, you are highest people in the evolution, you are the ones who are looked after by God, you are the most important people.<br>
It's true! And you must be provided for. You should have no problem of money, you should have no problem of housing, you should have no problem of anything.<br>
So, it is She, the Rājalakṣhmī who gives you all these thing[s]."</font><br>

<font color="Maroon"><b>O Mother! We have come out of the darkness and have entered into Enlightened world.
We could get pure knowledge from your Divine lap which the mortal world could not give so far.

have given us true rebirth.</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Vidyā! Vidyā: is the art of Sahaja Yoga</b>, which you know. That is Vidyā. The rest is all avidyā.

Lakṣhmī is the Grace, is the Grace.</b> Awareness that is gracious. <b>The awareness that is gracious.</b> So, that Lakṣhmī should be with you, is that not only to know the Vidyā, you know that, but to have grace about it. "</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Then the second one is Vidyā Lakṣhmī.</b> She's the one who teaches you the technique of handling the Divine Power. Now this [is] to be understood very well. What is a Lakṣhmī. Lakṣhmī is graciousness. So She teaches you how to use this power with graciousness.<br>
......<br> 
Now, the Vidyā Lakṣhmī is the one, as I told you, gives you knowledge, knowledge how to handle the Divine Power graciously. I'll give you an example. I've seen many people when they give bandhan, it's such a crude way, that ... No! It is not to be done! It's a Lakṣhmī's blessing. So how you do it, very carefully. You see Me, how I give always. I never do that way! I cannot! With respect, with grace. She represents the respect part of it. And that you get, that knowledge, how to do it gracefully. Everything to be done gracefully, in a manner that looks gracious. See, some people who talk have no grace, some people who give knowledge of Sahaja Yoga also have no grace and they talk in a disgraceful manner. So all the grace, how to use the knowledge of the Divine, is given by Vidyā Lakṣhmī."</font><br>
