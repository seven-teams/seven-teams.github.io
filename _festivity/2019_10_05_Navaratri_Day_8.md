<font color="DarkRed">"And on an Aṣhṭamī, that is today, is the eighth day of the Moon, of the Moon which is increasing, Śhuklapakṣhi; that first time all the weapons of the Goddess are to be worshiped. This was a great idea because these weapons who work all the time, not only to kill the evil but to protect the good, were never worshiped before; and that today, if human beings realize their importance and significance, then lots of problems of atomic bombs and all these things that have been created could be solved by diverting them to the right direction, using them for the destructions of the evil forces and not the good; also for protecting human life, nourishing human life. The same weapons can be used in a wrong direction; but, rightly used, they can be dedicated for the use of God’s work.<br>
All that is created by human beings, which looks apparently an instrument of destruction, but if human beings use their wisdom they will find out that all these inventions that have come to them from the prompting of the Unconscious, are for the work of God. All scientific research, everything that has been done, all these instruments that you have produced, are for the use of God.<br>
In a way, we can say that human beings have worked to create methods as instruments, as social, economic, political institutions to advance the mechanism of God’s work."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today we do, is a very great Pūjā of Aṣhṭamī [eighth day]: is the day when the Goddess killed nine rākṣhasas together with Her eight hands. So today is a very special day for which a very special attention is needed.<br>
It’s only at the behest of the bhaktas that the Goddess took Her form and killed all these rākṣhasas. Also with Her eight hands, She killed Mahiṣhāsura. That’s why She’s called as Mahiṣhāsuramardinī. She’s called as Nava Chaṇḍī, one who has killed nine chaṇḍas, means nine rākṣhasas She has killed. So is a very important day and very vital and very deep."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"You have to see that all the negativity goes away, around us, around the universe. So first we sing the praise of the Goddess; when She destroyed every negative, satanic incarnation of Mahiṣhāsura. And when he was killed, all the Gods praised Her for saving them from the ... from the destruction, and that happened long, long time back – it was ten thousand years back. So this is the praise of the Gods of that so that, whatever is the negativity, through those mantras will go away, because it surrounds us – you see that, all of them have been there coming; from ten thousand years they have been coming. But this is the way you can throw them out of the present into their proper places."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"After crossing the seventh day, after crossing the seventh chakra – that is the real ascent in your spiritual ascent. What are we to do on the eighth one?
It’s so Sahaja that today should be Aṣhṭamī, because that is the day the Goddess killed so may evildoers, and demons and rākṣhasas. She did it on Her own, alone. Now, these evil forces are manifesting in human beings. They have spread out. They are within us. So we all have to fight those forces within us.<br>
The war is within ourselves, is not without. First, when you ascend the seventh chakra, when you are on the eighth step, you have to remember first you have to fight those forces within ourselves.<br>
You are all very intelligent people; bit too intelligent sometimes. So whatever I say you may twist it, and may try to use it in your own intelligence. But it is not in your well-being. It is not for your ‘hita’, for your good. You want to use it because you think you are intelligent, and maybe you do not know you are using it that way. And that is what one has to know that these forces are acting within us. They act through our intelligence, they act through our emotions, and they act through our physical being. So we have to be very careful.<br>
When you ascend into Sahaja Yoga, we have to be very careful with our intelligence, because intelligence has capacity to cheat itself. And it will cheat us, nobody else. It is against us, against our own power. So we have to be alert and see for ourselves. So as soon as you enter onto the eighth step you should start seeing at yourself."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So today on this day of Aṣhṭamī, which is a very powerful day, you assume that power within yourself that ‘I can fight all these horrible diseases within myself. And for others, I will have compassion and love. I will have not other.’ This is the point we miss always. ......<br>
And that compassion will bring forth the beauty of Sahaja Yoga."</font><br>
