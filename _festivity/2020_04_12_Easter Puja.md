<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, we are celebrating the Resurrection of Christ.</b>
That is the greatest message of Christ[’s] life, not the crucifixion. Anybody can be crucified and killed, but this dead body of Christ was resurrected from death. Death itself died and He overcome in [overcame it].<br>
It’s a miracle for ordinary human beings, definitely, but not for Christ because He was a Divine Person. He was Śhrī Gaṇeśha, He was Auṃkāra Itself. So, He could walk on the water, gravity would not affect Him, and also He got resurrected because death could not affect Him. Such a Great Divine Personality, specially created for human beings that people should recognize Him.
But they did not recognize Him, they killed Him in a very brutal manner. And even now, they think cross is a great thing because Christ died on a cross. It’s a very cruel idea of human beings to respect the cross. What does it show? It shows that people liked all the cruelties done to Him, symbolizing cross as the one that represented His death and His atrocities, the way He was tortured.<br>
So, it was a very sad time when He was crucified. But when <b>He got resurrected it was the most joyous, most auspicious and most beautiful time.</b><br>
<b>The Resurrection of Christ is very symbolic for Sahaja Yoga. If Christ could be resurrected, then the human beings also can be resurrected, because He came as a human being with all powers and He created the Path of Resurrection for us. This Path of Resurrection is the one that we have followed in Sahaja Yoga.</b>"</font><br>

Christ was knowledge.<br>
He knew His goal.<br>
He spoke the Truth with complete courage, intensity and dedication."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Very gratifying to see so many of you established in Sahaja Yoga, blooming with joy.</b><br>
May God bless you all!<br>
Today we are celebrating the Resurrection of Christ [and] with it we also have to celebrate the Resurrection of human beings, of Sahaja Yogis who have been resurrected as realized Souls. With that we have to understand that we enter into a new awareness. There was no need for Christ to enter into any new awareness, He had to come down and again to show to this world that you are the eternal life, that you lead a life that is spiritual, which never perishes.<br>
You have to rise into that new realm which is the Realm of God Almighty, what you call the Kingdom of God."</font><br>

<p style="color:DarkGreen; text-align:center;">
<b>You were crucified and resurrected in pure Spirit.<br>
You rose after three days.<br>
You are peace.<br>
You absorb all thought.<br>
You abide in the Ādi Āgñyā chakra. </b>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"The Resurrection of Christ is very symbolic for Sahaja Yoga. If Christ could be resurrected, then the human beings also can be resurrected, because He came as a human being with all powers and He created the Path of Resurrection for us. This Path of Resurrection is the one that we have followed in Sahaja Yoga.<br>
But the greatest thing is the piercing of the Āgñyā chakra, which is described in all spiri... spiritual treaties or may be called as the Scriptures, that that is the door which is goldened, which is like a cover and no one can pass through that, so constricted is this door of Āgñyā chakra. But Christ did cross that.<br>
His crossing has helped us today to open your Sāhasr... open your Āgñyā. <b>Without opening the Āgñyā you cannot go to Sahasrār. And this was done so easily in your case only because Christ could go through all that torture and all that brutality and crossed over."</b></font><br>

<p style="color:DarkGreen; text-align:center;">
<b>You promised the comforter who is Shri Mataji, the Holy Spirit.<br>
You return as a king. You are Shri Kalki.<br>
You are the principle of evolution.<br>
You are the support of our evolution.</b>
</p>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"And you have to work very hard to develop yourself vertically in balance with’s your horizontal growth.<br>
Is not My lecture for entertainment or anything, but should go to your heart, to your brain, to your being. That’s, this is very important. And you are not going to waste it. All the time you have to think that you are a Sahaja Yogi and you have to know what you have to do in Sahaja Yoga and how to achieve it. You should not be satisfied unless and until you have achieved that excellence. That’s the very important, crucial point today. <b>I wanted to tell you because today is Easter Day which was a very crucial point for the development or the growth of the Spirit, because Sahasrāra we could never have achieved if Āgñyā was blocked.</b><br>
Christ could have said, ‘All right, let Paramachaitanya do it. Let Paramachaitanya get Itself hanged.<br>
Why should I do it?’ He had to do it and He was the instrument, and is done it.<br>
So Sahaja Yoga is not only for exploiters. If you try just to exploit Sahaja Yoga, you’ll be exploited, too. <b>But is for the exploitation of joy. But that’s only possible if you grow, you touch your depth. If you are not deep enough, you’ll hang in the air, as I said. And that has to be worked out.</b> That has to be found out, how best you can do it, how much you can reach people, how many people you have given Realization, how many people you’re going to help improve their health, their mental conditions, and then how much you are going to talk about Sahaja Yoga.<br>
So, that is going to work out what I call the collective ascent of human beings."</font><br>

<p style="color:DarkGreen; text-align:center;">
<b></b>You are the end of evolution.<br>
You are the evolution from collective subconscious to collective consciousness.<br> 
You are the narrow gate.<br>
You are the way to the Kingdom of Heaven.<br>
You are the silence.

<font color="DarkRed">"Thinking of Christ, I find it impossible to keep awaken even, because hah ... to keep in these modern times is very difficult when you are thinking of Christ and talking about Him. It[’s] just something, shows that how people never understood such a great man, such a great personality. And He was Divine, absolutely Divine! Despite that, He made a drama, we should say, to go through all the sufferings. Is very painful, even to remember all that, how He crucified Himself, and He how He died.<br>
But the main point is this: He’s done [it] for you, for all of you, and you are so indebted to Him. <b>It is His work which has helped the Kuṇḍalinī to be awakened and could pass through this fontanel bone area.</b><br>
<b>All this would have been impossible without the sacrifice of Christ. You all should thus deserve to have some sacrifices.</b><br>
<b>See, this is a very symbolic thing that has happened. And you all should be all the time prepared to sacrifice whatever is possible for the emancipation of humanity.</b> Is very, very subtle. At this moment now, forget about those seeking[s], forget about everything, what is needed is that: you have to remember all the time that you are saved, you are being blessed by the sacrifices of Christ. Is very important!"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"That’s the only hope we have, that Sahaja Yogi are resurrected. Only thing I’ve ... know that, if we have so many Sahaja Yogis, this world will change. This world has to change. But your progress should go on: you, you should progress more and more, not, you should not retrace back. For small things here and there, don’t worry. You have a very great responsibility, and that responsibility is to transform the human beings. That’s your due: ‘How many have you transformed? How many have you changed?’ It’s all right, for men or women, you have to change people. This is your job and this is the power you have got from Christ: that you have to change them, transform them into the new world of happiness and joy, which we call it as the Sahaj Nirmal Dharma."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"My desire is that with your purity you can recognize and respect your own purity. 
If you wear clean clothes you become very careful and aware of respecting your clothes.
Reality is the Self Itself, the Universal Spirit, immersed in the Ocean of Nectar, Pure Love, which is Primordial Power.<br>
<b>In Sahaja Yoga penance means meditation, for dedication you must know when to get up, that must be the most important thing for a Sahaja Yogi.</b> The rest of the things work out automatically.<br>
<b>To grow in-depth you have to meditate.</b>"</font><br>
