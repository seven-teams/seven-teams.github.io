<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is the birthday of Śhrī Guru Nāṇaka.</b> It is being celebrated throughout the world with so much of zeal that I have not seen in India. For the first time it has been advertised in so many papers and by different means.<br>
Guru Nāṇaka always talked of Sahaja Yoga. ``Everything else," He said, ``is just showing off." About religion He said that, ``Observing fasts, going on pilgrimage, etc., are just meant to show off. Now you have to discover the power that is within you and establish it." Guru Nāṇaka kept on repeating the same thing again and again.<br>
......<br>
<b>But Guru Nāṇaka always talked of the Spirit.<'b> He explained it very clearly, but no one heeded what he wrote. They will just put a finger on the couplet and read it out. Could we understand him this way? If we go through his writings properly and absorb it, then the whole śhabda jālam [web of words], in which most of the people are caught, will come to an end. See the condition of Sikhs!<br>
Without looking within and experiencing the innate energy, how could one follow Sikh religion? Only this is the teaching of Guru Nāṇaka, this is what is called `Sikh' [learning]. All the Saints of that age had the discretion to know who is a Saint and who is not. All the gurus incorporated their poems and experiences in Guru Grantha and that is why Guru Grantha is revered so much. Only the renowned gurus contributed to it. They were so spiritual that they did churning of all the religious Scriptures and put the substance in Guru Grantha."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Guru Nāṇak was not a human being, He was not only a Paigambar [Prophet] but He was the Reincarnation of Ādi Guru, the Primordial Master, He was a Divine Personality.</b><br>
Of course, the people who were there at His time were so useless and gross people that they actually tortured His life and nobody followed Him. After His death is a different point.<br>
<b>He also has said that, "It is the Primordial Mother who has created the Universe.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is a special day of Guru Nāṇaka's birthday.</b><br>
Uh we have celebrated one Guru Pūjā uh-uh-uh ... and the, as you know that <b>Guru Nāṇak was also the Incarnation of the Primordial Master, the same Spirit came on this Earth. And the He's the One who tried to re-establish the work of Muhammad.</b><br>
Muhammad was the Incarnation of the same Spirit, the Primordial Master. He came on this Earth to establish the religion.<br>
Islam is the name of that religion, is the religion of every Sahaja Yogi, of every Christian, of every Hindu. <b>We all belong to One Religion which believes in expanding our ourne ... awareness to the new perception of collectivity: from human level to the higher level, where you can perceive and manifest the Divine Power. This is the religion we are following.<br>
All the religions were established on this Earth to create the seekers. You are the seekers: you are the Men of God. Now, all of you have to become Prophets. And to become Prophets, today's Sahaja Yoga has taken the form of Mahā Yoga. All of you have to become Prophets.</b>"</font><br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<font color="DarkRed">"When you go to any guru, first of all see the disciples, how they are: how they behave, what powers they have got. Then you accept. That's the sign of a Sadguru. 

Nāṇaka has said clearly. <b>Guru Nāṇak was such an enlightened Soul, and He said that: ``The one who meets [makes] you meet ... meet God is the Sadguru." Everybody is not a guru.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>Love the saints of every faith<br>
Put away thy pride.<br>
Remember the essence of religion<br>
Is meekness and sympathy.<br>
Not fine clothes,<br>
Not the Yogi's garb and ashes,<br>
Not the blowing of the horns,<br>
Not long prayers,<br>
Not recitations and torturous,<br>
Not the ascetic way,<br>
But a life of goodness and purity,<br>
Amid the world's temptations.<br>
"Vahe Guru" is the Guru Mantra that God is the ultimate!<br>
"Vahe Guru"</b></font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>The Prophets have two special qualities, as all the Prophets had: first of all, they have to talk about spiritual education.</b> All of Them did that: Muhammad Sāhab did it, Rāja Janaka did it, Nāṇaka did it, Moses did it, Abraham did it. All of Them prophesized and taught you how to lead yourself in the right path, by the right action, by leading a right life.<br>
You are going to be the Prophets of a little different nature. You are Prophets, you are Islamic, you are a Jews, you are Parsis. You are all those, but you are going to become Prophets which are called as Pīr in Islam, in Hindu Scriptures it's called as ātma-sākṣhātkāri, ātmajas. In the way Nāṇaka has described, He calls them Par. But you are endowed with a greater power, there's more power in you. There they had a bigger propensity. You have another delicate power by which you can raise the Kuṇḍalinī of people.<br>
You are going to be Prophets who are going to make others Prophets. Not only to establish religion but to make them Prophets. This is the most important thing. Not just to maintain a static state of righteous, religious, good people but that to evolve those seekers, those righteous, good, religious people into Prophets. And those Prophets whom you will evolve will also be the same type of Prophets but they will also have this additional power by which they will also evolve. That is why it is a Mahā Yoga.<br>
<b>This is the greatest work in the history of all spiritual history: that you are the Prophets who are looking after the Men of God, and you are going to transform them into Prophets.</b></font>"<br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"It is the same thing, everybody has said: ``You should know about your Self."<br>
Guru Nāṇaka's thing I'll say:</font> <font color="DarkGreen">``Kāhe re bana khojan jāe, Sadā [Sarab] nivāsī sadā alepā tohī saṃga samāī, Puṣhpamadhya jo bāsa basata hai mukara māhī jaise chhāī, Taise hī harī base niraṃtara ghaṭa hī khojo bhāī, Kahe Nāṇaka bina āpā chīnai miṭai na bhrama kī khāī."</font> <font color="DarkRed"He said, ``You must know your Self." ``Know thyself" Christ has said. Everybody has said, ``You should know your Self."<br>
Now what is that, knowing your Self? That is nothing but you are.<br>
The principle is this that the Truth is this that you are not this body, this mind, you are not these emotions, you are not this ego; you are not this conditionings, but you are the pure Spirit. All our Saints have said that."</font><br>
