<font color="DarkRed">"Today we have gathered here to worship Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's Incarnation.<br>
As you know that Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa is the Incarnation of Nārāyaṇa, of Śhrī Viṣhṇu.<br>
So in every Incarnation, They carry all Their qualities, all Their powers, and all Their nature with Them.<br>
So when He incarnated, He had all the qualities of Nārāyaṇa, and then that of Rāma, but every Incarnation tries to rectify whatever in Their previous life has been misunderstood and have been carried to the extremes. That's why They have to come back again and again.<br>
......<br>
So, as Śhrī Viṣhṇu, when He thought of taking His Incarnation, because He is the One who is the Sp... Preserver, He's the Preserver, of this Creation, and also the Preserver of Dharma. So when He took His Incarnation He had to see that people keep to their dharma.<br>
By keeping the dharma all right only, you could get your Realization."</font><br>

So today we are going to see to the two aspects of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, which were the manifestation of His divine birth. ...... <b>So the first aspect of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa we have to understand is the Yogeśhwara and the second aspect of him as the Virāṭa.</b><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today we are celebrating here in this holy land the Birthday of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br>
Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa is the ultimate of the fatherhood, that I described you before, who came on this Earth and illustrated the ultimate of that. <b>So on this Earth, the highest fatherhood is Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa's awareness.</b> But in the Kingdom of God, we can say in Heavens, or even above everything else, resides Sadāśhiva who does not take Incarnations. He is one of the aspects, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa is one of the aspects of Sadāśhiva which is the Father.<br>
And the Ādi Śhakti or the Holy Ghost is the other aspect of Sadāśhiva which is His Power.<br> 
So when Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa incarnated on this Earth, an aspect of this Ādi Śhakti came on this Earth as Rādhā."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"Now look at Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa as a child: how innocent He was, and how powerful! He wanted to eat the butter. Now why He wanted to eat the butter because all the butter that was made in Gokul, in that place, was sent to Mathura where this horrible King Kaṃsa was ruling. And all his military people became very strong by eating that butter. So He didn't want them to eat the butter, so He started a kind of a tribe of small children and a game that they climb on top of each other. And the butter was kept in a pot hanging from the roof, so they would go and eat all that up. In that little childhood He started this innocent play, so all the children used to climb up and eat the butter. So now there's no butter left, so how will they take it to Mathura? This was done and one day His mother caught hold of Him.<br>
She said, "Did You eat any butter from here?" All butter was here all around. He said, "How? How can I eat the butter? See, can I reach My hand there? See now, how can I ..." "Oh, so You took the stick and broke it?" "No, no, I did not." "Then what is all this?" "See, these are all My friends who ate it. I put it on My mouth so that you can beat Me." So innocently talking like an ordinary child, this One, an ordinary, simple child. So Mother said, "All right. Let Me see Your mouth."<br>
He opens the mouth and She sees the complete, She sees the complete universe, complete universe revolving into His mouth.<br>
And She sees it. And She says, "Oh Lord, please forgive Me. I forgot! I really forgot that You are the Lord of this universe and I am doubting You!" She just fell at His feet. "There must be some play in what You're doing." In a simple, innocent way like a child would say He told the Mother.<br>
So the innocence of a child and the innocence of a virgin, or you can say the chastity of a virgin and innocence of a child brought forth, brought forth the existence of America."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today we have gathered here to do Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa Pūjā.<br>
We have to understand clearly that Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa is a very-very important Deity within us. Because He is the Viṣhṇu, who resides in the Void, in the Nābhī. He is the One who generates dharma within us.<br>
When you got your Realization I didn't tell you, 'Don't do this,' 'Don't do that.' I never told you that, 'This is not good, 'That is not good.' You just did it, because Śhrī Viṣhṇu was awakened within you.<br>
He is in the Void, and if He is awakened, He brings you to the light: removes your ignorance, removes your darkness, and you start seeing that whatever you were doing was destructive for you. And that's how the dharma is established. Of course, the dharma was established also by all the Ten's Gurus who came on this Earth, the Prophets, who taught us about dharma."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"<b>So Kṛiṣhṇa was a[n] Incarnation of Diplomacy, I must say, Divine Diplomacy, because He knew about the human brain, and He knew how to put it forward.</b> So He said, "All right, you do all your karmas, and put it at the Lotus Feet of the Lord," which cannot be, it's not possible. We may mentally think, "Oh, I'm doing all for God's sake I'm doing this." That's just our imagination. But you just don't do it, because the karma has to become akarma, means 'non-action' -- that's only possible when you get your Self-realization. When a self-realized Soul gives you Kuṇḍalinī, he doesn't say -- raises your Kuṇḍalinī, doesn't say, 'I do it.' He says, "It's rising, it's going, it's working out." In the third person he talks, so the whole thing becomes akarma.<br>
Then He says that, "Whatever are the flowers and things like that you give Me," that's the Bhakti Yoga, "I'll take it." But He uses only one word on which He has made everybody dance, and that word is ananya -- <b>Ananya Bhakti: "When there is not the other, when you are united with Me."</b> "</font><br>

<p>
<font color="blue">"So this Viśhuddhi on the right-hand side is to be controlled by surrendering as it is said, actually you surrender your ego to begin with. And this ego when you surrender, it has to be done from you heart, it should not be a lip service. From your heart: "I don't want this ego any more, I want reality. Let the reality be seen by me, felt by me, enjoyed by me." And once you start doing it from your heart you'll be amazed that your voice will become sweet. Apart from that it will have the Divine Power flowing through it. That is what we say that you have now got Vāk Śhakti, means 'the Power of Speech'.<br>
So when you surrender ego, what do you do actually is to say that, "I'm not doing anything, it is You who do everything." So that a little drop has now become an Ocean. And so, your sound has got the Power of the Ocean. "</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"So the main Principle of Kṛiṣhṇa was collectivity -- Rāsa -- everybody one with the energy; energy circulates through everyone, and just the opposite that the country developed into individualism and everything was to create something that collective was not. Individualism, when it is not connected to the mains, is destruction. Like all these trees you see, they are individuals as you see them separate, but inside they are fed by the same Mother [Earth]. They have the same sap running in them. When this connection is broken, then all this individualism is nothing but destruction and that's how in America the connection with the collectivity was broken by every sort of funny methods that one cannot conceive how human beings can go to that level."</font><br>
