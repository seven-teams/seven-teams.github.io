<font color="DarkRed">"Today we are celebrating here a special day called Makar Saṅkrānt. For the information of the foreign Sahaja Yogis, I will explain to you what it means.<br>
......<br>
<b>It means the day, today is the day the Sun crosses over from the Tropic of Capricorn to the Tropic of Cancer.</b> It is a very big day for us because, now during the summertime we have the harvest, and we look forward to the rain and so many things that happen in every country. The Sun falls at right angles in this country during the summer season and so we welcome the Sun. <b>We eat something -- that you must have eaten already -- what we call as til and jaggery.</b> It is to prepare your body and your mind to give it sufficiency to receive the Sun. Because if you are living in the cool season, then all your body, mind becomes lethargic and you become also sometimes very lazy about things in the sense, that the day is so small, that you cannot achieve many results. So the body has become cold as we call it. We take these things, which give us heat so body is prepared to receive the heat of the Sun to welcome. "</font><br>

<font color="DarkGreen">"Today is Saṅkrānti. Saṅkrānti means that today there is something new going to happen. Kuṇḍalinī has awakened within you and you have become new person compared to what you were before. But on the day of Saṅkrānti, you should know that you have to please the Goddess who is sitting within you.
What should you do to make Her happy? You distributed sesame seeds and jaggery. That is for love. To increase the love between each other, we give sesame seeds and jaggery."</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"But to make it a Saṅkrānta -- Holy Revolution -- you have to take to new ... new religion, new steps. First of all, your own step should be enlightened, and then you must establish new steps to go ahead. And these are the new steps which are different for the Westerners and different for the Easterners.<br>
Just now I told them about the Eastern style and then I'll tell you later on about the Western. We have to have new ideals, new styles because we are the courageous people, we are the valiant people. We'll have to fight the War of Love, through Love. And it's a very delicate thing. When the Moon moves ... the Sun moves from the left to the right that means your desire becomes your action."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Today is the day they give you a sweet thing to say that you must speak sweetly which is very important for Western people that when you are doing and organizing you become heated up, there’s tension and you develop a temperament which is dry, emotionless. You know the heart goes into a tantrum. At that time they say that you take the sweet.<br>
This sweet is a heated thing because now the Sun is moving towards the other side. That time also they, to give it a balance, they say: “Speak very sweetly. Use sweet words, use sweetness. Bring sweetness in your language.” Which is very important, you understand that.<br>
And this is one of the religions we have to accept that we will not use harsh words to each other and then later on to others. First of all to each other. There are many people who’ll be kind to others because others will eat them off but unkind to their own Sahaja Yogis. Because it is a universal happening. It’s the whole thing is working out universally. Even if you organize, you organize for the whole. Those who are organizing have no business to be harsh and those who are not organizing has [have] no business to be slow. We must move with the same speed, with the same understanding."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"...... when on the Saṅkrānti, when the day changes, on the 14th of January when the Sun changes over, then they give the sweet, [unclear] saying that, ‘We’ll give you the sweet and speak to us in the same way in a sweet manner’ – so friendship. <b>Sugar gives you friendship. You give sweets to people to establish friendship.</b>"</font><br>

<p>
<font color="DarkRed">"And this is the day when we celebrate it, in a way to surrender ourselves to the Sūrya, to the Sun which is, as you know, is the residence of Śhrī Lord Jesus Christ. He resides on the Sun. So how humble He was, how humble He was residing on the Sun. The more you live on the Sun, there should be much more humility. Of course I must say in India, people are humbler. But still, the quality of Sun can make you extremely arrogant and very unpleasant person. This unpleasant person can really ruin all kinds of good relations. But the worst thing that happens to us, is that we lose our integration. Because when we say harsh things to anyone we feel guilty, so we have another problem, our heart feels bad, our liver feels bad everything is upset and thus you feel absolutely disintegrated. And this disintegrated is the sign of our not evolving at all, or we should say devolving.<br>
This integration is such a common thing that we see, in ourselves, we see that we fight with our ego, then we fight with our superego, then we fight with our heart with our emotions and all the time we are fighting within ourselves. So at least, within ourselves we should speak sweetly on this day. Then we can start speaking to others very, very sweet. Now some people think, to speak sweetly is a sign of weakness.<br>
In some countries people believe that if you speak to someone sweetly, it is a sign of weakness. It is the greatest [unclear time/strike ...] of Sahaja Yogi to speak to others with respect with proper protocol and with proper understanding."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>I am giving you the powers, you can assimilate them.</b> If you just meditate every day it is not sufficient. You have to see what well-being you are giving to the others. But instead of that, you always think about your own well-being and come and ask Me to treat your son, your father, your mother, or ask that you should get a good job. And you want that I should also come to your house to eat, do this, do that. This way, you try to impose your will upon Me but about you, what can you do? You should always remember that you have to do something. <b>'I will show Śhrī Mātājī what I’m capable of, to do something special.'</b> We should decide this once and for all. I have an image in front of My eyes as Śhrī Gyāneśhwara has said “Bolte Piyushanche Sagar” [Words or sayings are like the oceans of Nectar]. Where is it? I want to see it.<br>
<b>Thus on this auspicious day I give you all My sweet blessings that you will help everyone and look after their well-being and you will treat everyone with love and you will talk sweetly, full of love.</b>"</font><br>

She named it 'Prathisthan' - after the capital of Her ancestors who ruled over the province of Paithan."<br>
