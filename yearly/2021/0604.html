Money has become so important. It has gone to the other end, so much so that it has created a very paradoxical uh culture.<br /> ......<br /> So is not only religion, but also race. Races: uh, 'This race is better,' 'That race is better,' all these funny ideas they had. Sahaja Yogis have to understand, that whatever races you were, now you have come up higher. Now you are in the Kingdom of God. And here, you are Sahaja Yogis. You are no more any special race. We are Sahaja Yogis: we have really ascended higher and higher.<br /> ......<br /> So when they go to that ha... height, that level of achievement, they have to know, the Sahaja Yogis have to know, that we are here to cure this world.<br /> ......<br /> So, what I felt was that the Sahaja Yogis have to get rid of their egos, very important. Otherwise they cannot grow.<br /> See the sensitivity has to move towards everything, not only towards nature, towards uh beautiful things that are in the world, but also the ugly things that are happening, one has to be sensitive to see, 'Now, what's happening? What's going to happen to our children? Are they going to take to drugs? Are they going to take to alcohol? Are they going to take to bad ways of life? Also are they going to be rude, unkind, and ego again? Are they having ego in them?' Because this progeny is the one which is going to save. So our attention should be that, 'Our nonsensical ideas should go away.'<br /> Now this racialism has brought so much sin on this world, can see it when you go to Argentina or you go to Chile or to these places: you can't find one aboriginal there, not one. Only if you go to Colombia and uh you go to-oo ... Bolivia, they are there. And they are such nice people, such innocent, simple people.<br /> To think that millions were killed by these stupid White people, I mean, I can't understand.<br /> And these sins are now working on them, specially Americans, the way they are consuming mh their drugs, from where? Bolivia.<br /> ......<br /> This is what we have to find out: the criteria and what are we going to contribute ourselves.<br /> The best way, now, is to see that you reduce all these false ideas about race, religion, beauty, this, that, and bring it to reality. Whosoever meets you or you talk to them and who is related to you in any way, wherever you are, you have to show them: that there's nothing ah-ah in this kind of an ugliness that is within us. Is real ugliness.<br /> ......<br /> So we come to Sahaja Yoga to see: 'What we have done for Sahaj Yog? How much we have been able to help Sahaj Yog?' Only just we think about ourselves, you some of them are, 'Married life is not all right,' this thing, that thing. I mean, this is something one has to understand: you are a person who [the] Divine has chosen to do something extremely noble, extremely important. While what are we doing? We are again getting into this mad world which is so paradoxical, which is so stupid. So you should see: 'Where are we?'<br /> ......<br /> So you can pull the whole society. You can uh really save this society. Is a big responsibility. You are intelligent people, you understand things, but ah sometimes I feel you do not assume your powers, because of your ego [you] don't assume.<br /> First thing is to be humble. If you're humble down, then you will start seeing yourself clearly, what's wrong with you. Once you start seeing yourself then you will know, 'This is not Sahaj. This is not Sahaj.' Everything will change once you get to it. So, first thing is to humble down.<br /> ......<br /> If you start thinking, 'I am sick, I am sick,' you will get sick, what is there? If you start thinking, 'I am all right, I am all right,' you will be all right.<br /> ......<br /> But here it is, for Sahaja Yogis, to know that you are already immune. You have got your vibrations. How can anything trouble you or torture you?<br /> ......<br /> Don't see any doctors! No use. Absolutely absurd for Sahaja Yogis to go to doctors and hospitals and doctors and hospital. That means you have no faith in yourself and poor faith in Sahaja Yoga."<br /> <font color="blue"><b>1994-0413 Talk to Sahaja Yogis, We Are Here to Cure This World, before Moving to a Hotel, Āśhram, Wamuran (63 kms N of Brisbane), Queensland, Australia</b></font><br /></p><p>Link to suggested talk: <a href="https://vimeo.com/57417421"> video</a></p><p style="color:red;">Jay Śhrī Mātājī!<br /></p><p>Yearly Topics Team</p></section><footer class="page__meta"></footer><nav class="pagination"> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/yearly/2021/0528" class="pagination--pager" title="Celebrating 40 Years of Sahaja Yoga in Australia, Canada, Italy and U.S.A. and its Culture, Post 22 ">Previous</a> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/yearly/2021/0613" class="pagination--pager" title="Celebrating 40 Years of Sahaja Yoga in Australia, Canada, Italy and U.S.A. and its Culture, Post 24 ">Next</a></nav></div></article></div><script src="https://seven-teams.github.io/assets/js/main.min.js"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', '', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script src="https://unpkg.com/vanilla-back-to-top@7.2.1/dist/vanilla-back-to-top.min.js"></script> <script>addBackToTop()</script></body></html>
