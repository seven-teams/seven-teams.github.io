And They are sitting there, busybodies, you know [soft laughter]. They are sitting quietly waiting for a chance, you see, to emit vibrations, to save you, you see, They want to just rush. They emit so much [laughing:] that They lose, ‘Just wait, just wait.’ They want to save you, They want to give you, They’re so anxious, in Their anxiety to save you. I like it, to see the way They are anxious. But [laughs] ... but you don’t suck it and I have a problem there. Once They’ve given They don’t want to take it back. You don’t suck it, so it has to go to the atmosphere, it has to disappear somewhere. Is directed towards you and you don’t take it, so where does it go? It hangs into My tissues, it pains Me.<br /> So, sucking should be more. Sucking should be more. And just before the Pūjā you should say: 'Mother, make me such that I suck more of the Divine!' Just pray that, with sincerity from your heart, just say that."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1982-0801 Śhrī Ādi Śhakti Pūjā, Seminar, Cowley Manor, Cheltenham, UK</b></font></p><p style="color:DarkRed; text-align:center;"> <b>Binatī Suniye Ādi Śhakti Meri</b><br /> O Ādi Śhakti, please listen to my request<br /> <b>Pūjana kā adhikār. dījiye</b><br /> Please give me the authority to do Your Pūjā<br /> <b>Śharaṇāgat. hai hṛiday. pujārī</b><br /> Your worshipper is surrendered to You from the heart.<br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMK6gaaQ1hU">video</a></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"But many universes have been created by Ādi Śhakti, even before us.

Just now let us see how She assumes Her ... Her Power.<br /> When She decides to create, She is endowed with Three Powers: She has Three Powers of God which are granted to Her. By one power, first of all, is the existence, the desire to exist, She desires to exist with God. The second power is to create and the third power is to sustain. First power is existence, second is to create and the third is the evolving power or sustainance [sustenance] power by which gradually you sustain something and you become something. These are the Three Powers She assumes. In short, we can say that <b>She forms Three Powers of Mahākālī, Mahāsaraswatī and Mahālakṣhmī.
