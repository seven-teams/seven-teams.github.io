"But then she dies and her intestines are drawn out into wires and some Saint fixes them on the tutari," that instrument that they have, ektāri as they call it, "and he goes on pulling it with his fingers, then it says 'Tū hī, Tū hī, Tū hī,' " that is, "You are, You are, You are."

He brought forth so many fundamental truths in his poetry and he talked about it."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>2002-0724 Guru Pūrnimā Pūjā, Cabella Ligure, Italy</b></font></p><p> Sahaja Yogi: Śhrī Mātājī, how can we develop that same heart that poets like Kabīr have for You?<br /> <font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b> Why not? See the handicap of Kabīr. You have no handicaps. Kabīr had no Mother to tell Him, no Mother to love Him, look after Him and tell Him all these things. He had a Guru, and you know Kabīr's life. Kabīr wanted to become the disciple of Rāmānanda Swāmī, but He was a Muslim or low caste or whatever it is, so He could not reach Rāmānand Swāmī. The disciples would not allow Him to go near Rāmānand Swāmī. So one day Kabīra went and slept on the steps of the River Ganges, all night in the cold waiting for Rāmānand Swāmī to come because He used to always pass the same way. And His Feet fell on Kabīra and He said, "Oh My child, what are you doing here?"<br /> So Kabīra got up and He said, "Sir, You have accepted Me as Your disciple today."<br /> He said, "Yes, I have." And then Rāmānand Swāmī took Him and He trained Him into something great.<br /> You don't have these handicaps, where Kabīra never had anybody to support him or help him around. Actually single-handed he fought the whole world. Horrible people were around him; even today those who are in his place in Patna or in all places where he lived -- I was surprised that He described Kuṇḍalinī as `Surati' and they described tobacco as 'surati'. Such horrible nonsensical people, making fun of everything. There Kabīra lived and developed that heart. You don't have all these handicaps at all. You all speak the same language, you live with the same ideas, you have your own Mother to tell you everything, so you can develop the same heart as Kabīra had. </font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1987-0506 Talk to Sahaja Yogis, The Need to Go Deeper and Questions and Answers, Āśhram, 10 Clarence Street, Burwood, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image446.png" /></div><p style=" text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>Nirbhay Nirgun Gun Re Gayunga</b><br /> (Fearlessly I will sing the praise of the Nirguna.....<br /> ......I Will Unify the Five Elements<br /> Ingila, Pingala and Sukhman are the Channels<br /> I Will Bathe at the Confluence of the Three Rivers...…)<br /> Nirbhay Nirgun Gun Re Gaunga ||<br /> Mool Kamal Dradh Aasan Bandhu-ji<br /> Ulti Pavan Chadaunga ||<br /> Man Mamta Ko Thir Kar Laun-ji<br /> <b>Pancho Tat Milaunga ||</b><br /> <b>Ingala Pingala Sukhman Nadi-ji</b><br /> Tirveni Pe Haun Nahaunga ||<br /> Panch Pachhison Pakad Mangaun-ji<br /> Ek Hi Dor Lagaunga ||<br /> Shunya Shikhar Par Anhad Baje-ji<br /> Raag Chattis Sunaunga ||<br /> Kahat Kabir Suno Bhai Sadho-ji<br /> Jeet Nishan Ghuraunga ||</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>Nirbhay Nirgun gun re</b></font><br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_buuncAm9Ts&amp;list=RD_buuncAm9Ts#t=0">video</a></p><p> <font color="DarkGreen">"We ourselves, you see, prove that our religion is weak because we have not known the person who brought this religion on this Earth.
