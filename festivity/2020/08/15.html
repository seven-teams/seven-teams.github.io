First She establishes our dharma by which we become righteous, we become religious in the real sense. After the light of Realization we cannot do anything that is not dharma. As you know what is dharma is, and the maryādās, the boundaries of our behavior. This transformation takes place automatically. I don't have to tell you, ``Don't do this, don't do this," like Ten Commandments. You, yourself, establish your dharma and you enjoy your virtues. This happens, as you know -- already has happened to all of you -- with the Grace of Mahālakṣhmī. Then She starts bestowing blessings on you."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1993-0908 Shrī Mahālakṣhmī Pūjā, National Palace of Culture, NDK, Sofia, Bulgaria</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image481.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>Sancta Maria, Dei Genitrix glorificamus Te,</b></font><br /> <font color="DarkRed">Holy Mother, Mother of God, we glorify Thee.</font><br /> <font color="DarkRed"><b>Immaculata Dea, Dei Genitrix, laudamus Te,</b></font><br /> <font color="DarkRed">Immaculate Goddess, Mother of God, we praise Thee.</font><br /> <font size="+0"></font>Ave Maria Śhrī Mātājī<br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8DVCazj_ys">video</a></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"There's so much can be said about this Mahālakṣhmī Tattwa; you are all blessed so much by that.<br /> And so today we remember Her Great Incarnation as Maria, who was very great because She had to bear terrible pain in Her heart with All Her Powers that She had, She was a tremendously powerful Lady. But despite that, She bore all the tortures of Christ upon Her heart. And it was Her order and Her desire that Christ had to crucify Himself so that people could be resurrected.

But slavery does not go easily only by celebrating our independence day. It has to go completely from our minds.</b> And one has to realize that we are really independent people now.<br /> We are independent it does not mean that we are abandoned people. Those who have not paid anything to achieve this independence cannot understand also the value of this independence. The slavery is in our mind still lingering on.<br /> Indians are now more westernized, anglicized than they were ever before. Before independence as they had to struggle out of it they protested. But when we became independent we started thinking that we should also imbibe all the bad qualities from the West. So this is also a kind of a slavery which is very subtle. Also the people who ruled us are still carrying on with the idea that [they are] still ruling us. Is all imaginary. Both things are imaginary. They don’t exist anymore. As far as we are concerned in India, we have to know that this independence was granted to us through God’s Grace. We have won it through nonviolence and truth, and granted to us, for us to achieve our spiritual ascent. To become spiritually enlightened and find out from our root what Truth has been laid for us."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1982-0126 Pūjā, 33rd Republic Day Celebration, Lonavala, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image483.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>We have seen those days too when our country was not independent but you people are liberated now.
