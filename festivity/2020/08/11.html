So, she’s the one who has sustained the energy, and so, she’s called as Rādhā. She’s the Power of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br /> The word Kṛiṣhṇa comes from the word – kṛiṣhi, means – the plowing, or you can say, agriculture is called as ‘kṛiṣhi’. The one who plows and puts the seed in the soil, is doing the kṛiṣhi. And, that’s why he’s called as Kṛiṣhṇa.<br /> Now, the seed that he has sown, is the seed of spirituality. It is Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa who said, in Sanskrit “Nainaṃ chindanti śhastrāṇi, nainaṃ dahati pāvakaḥ, Na chainaṃ kledayanty āpo, na śhoṣhayati mārutaḥ” [Bhagavad Gītā 2.23], meaning – it cannot be, means, the spiritual life or you can say, the eternal life, or the Spirit, cannot be killed by anything, by any weapon, neither can be blown away by air, nor can it be sucked in, nor can it be destroyed."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1983-0918 Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa Pūjā, House of Dr. Vinod Worlikar, 17301 Maria Avenue, Cerritos, CA, U.S.A.</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image476.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="blue"><b>Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa resides in our Viśhuddhi chakra.<br /> In the center, He resides as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.</b></font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1986-0823 Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa Pūjā, Schwarzsee (2k kms SE of Fribourg), Switzerland</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"With the understanding that today is the day – <b>in the night about 12 o’clock</b>, now it must be about 12 o’clock in India also, about that, so it matches – <b>He was born at this time in the night</b>, because it was real night symbolically, under horrible circumstances He came.

So he started pouring rain on all the gopas and Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, who were looking after the cows. And the rain was so heavy that they thought that the whole land will be completely submerged. So Indra was very happy to spoil the game of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. And, he thought he was very successful.<br /> <b>So, Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa lifted a mountain on His finger</b>,<br /> and all these people who were getting drowned, went under that mountain.<br /> <b>This is Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa’s style.</b>"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1996-0901 Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa Pūjā, Hangar, Cabella Ligure, Italy</b></font> <font color="blue"><b>Auṃ Twameva sākṣhāt Śhrī Govardhana-dhara sākṣhāt Śhrī Ādi Śhakti Mātājī Śhrī Nirmalā Devyai namo namaḥ</b></font><br /> <b>The One who lifted up Mount Govardhan to shelter the villagers of Gokul from the terrible wrath of Indra’s thunderstorm</b></p><p> <font color="DarkGreen">"So in His childhood He used to play, He used to play with milkmaids and with other ladies.

You become a witness in the sense that all that is disturbing, all that is troubling you, all that is a problem, you just start watching it, you start witnessing it, you start seeing it, and you do not get disturbed. That seeing, that Witnessing State has a vi... tremendous power. Whatever you see without thinking, your problems get solved. Any problem you have, once you get this Witness State – what you call taṭasth, means you are standing on the shores and is watching the waves to move – then you know how to solve the problems.<br /> So, your Witness State has to be developed, and sometimes I have seen, people have to go through little difficulties to develop that Witness State. This is very important that once the Kuṇḍalinī starts supplying you from uh your Sahasrāra downward, moving on your uh chakras and enriching your different chakras, on the Viśhuddhi chakra when It has to stay, It really tries to uh little bit take you through turmoils.<br /> But this is the time when you should become taṭastha, means you should become a witness. If you become a witness, everything improves.<br /> And this is the best state which you call as Sākṣhi Swarūpatva, which you achieve when the Kuṇḍalinī comes up and the connection is established and the Divine Grace starts following [flowing] through that and enriches your Viśhuddhi chakra."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1988-0806 Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa Pūjā, Garlate (40 kms E of Como), Italy</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image479.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkGreen">O Divine Power of Yoga, absorb our central nervous system into one, uniting us in one world, one enlightened brain.<br /> You give the integration between brain and heart that makes it easy to have a divine and dharmic life.

Great quality of Yogeśhwara was complete discretion power built-in. So He knew who was a devil and who was not, who is good who is bad, who is possessed who is not possessed, who is innocent who is not. This was built-in within Him, this power of complete discrimination.<br /> And He had a capacity more expressing His witness-hood, as a Sākṣhi. He had the capacity, I mean He was a Sākṣhi Himself. I should say this way is easier to understand. He was a Sākṣhi, He had the capacity of witnessing the whole world as a play.<br /> ...... <b>Now this capacity in Him to witness has to be seen in every Yogi.</b>"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1983-0828 Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa Pūjā, Garden, Āśhram, 1 Chemin du Joran, Tannay (13 kms N of Geneva), Switzerland</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkGreen">"<b>So the main Principle of Kṛiṣhṇa was collectivity</b> – Rāsa – everybody one with the energy; energy circulates through everyone, and just the opposite that the country developed into individualism and everything was to create something that collective was not. Individualism, when it is not connected to the mains, is destruction. Like all these trees you see, they are individuals as you see them separate, but inside they are fed by the same Mother [Earth]. They have the same sap running in them. When this connection is broken, then all this individualism is nothing but destruction and that’s how in America the connection with the collectivity was broken by every sort of funny methods that one cannot conceive how human beings can go to that level."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1984-0818 Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa Pūjā, Backyard, House of Judy Gaddy, Engelwood, NJ, U.S.A.</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image480.png" /></div></p><p style=" text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>"You become the Dharma of Virāṭ.<br /> Now, what is the Dharma of Virāṭa?
