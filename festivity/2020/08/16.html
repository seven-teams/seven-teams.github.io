He employed the method, as king and diplomat, of Divine Diplomacy to explain the true nature of reality to people. The beauty of Divine Diplomacy is to achieve the spiritual betterment of people; its essence is to guide ignorant and foolish people towards the path of righteousness and religion by diplomatic ways, by clever handling or by illusion. In short, such people must be brought to the shores of Divine Love ‘by hook or by crook’. Shrī Kṛiṣhṇa’s life was spent with the masses, and thus His Incarnation gave rise to a mass spiritual movement. He appeared before Arjuna as the Virāta, and for the first time human eyes got a glimpse of the Primordial Being Himself.</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>The Book of Ādi Śhakti, Chapter 2: Divine Incarnations – Ambassadors of God</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image485.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="blue">"Ādi Viṣhṇu’s eighth form was as Shrī Kṛiṣhṇa during the Dwapara Yuga, and again Ādi Śhakti took three forms.</font><br /> <font color="blue"><b>Mahākālī lived for a very short time as Viṣhṇumāyā</b>, the infant sister of Shrī Kṛiṣhṇa.</font><br /> <font color="blue">She was actually born as the daughter of Yeshodā, Shrī Kṛiṣhṇa’s foster mother, and was killed by the demon Kamsa.

Let’s see the right side Vishuddhi when we catch. <b>Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa’s essence is sweetness – madhurya, madhurya.</b> And His power was Rādhā. ‘Ra’ is energy ‘dha’, means the one who has sustained the energy. And Her power was, She was called as Āhlāda. ‘Āhlāda’ means joy giving qualities She had. So <b>Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa’s qualities were that He was Yogeśhwara, so He was the witness and sweetness.</b> Now a person who shouts and screams and talks loudly and loses his temper in a very loud voice, or who speaks very loudly all the time, they all suffer from the right Vishuddhi. So one should understand that even when you have to scold somebody, you have to just say, “What are you doing? Why are you doing like this?” Otherwise “I give you, oh do like this?” Finished! Right Vishuddhi over. It’s finished now.<br /> <b>So for the right Vishuddhi we use the mantra of Viṭṭhala and Rukminī</b>, these two persons. You see it is very significant that also, because they say that there was a pundalikaksh, one boy who was serving his parents. And his parents were sleeping, he was pressing their feet when Viṭṭhala and His power Rukminī, they appeared in the door. But he said, “Now keep quiet. My parents are sleeping so you stay there!” So he had one brick near him which he threw and asked them, “You stay on that.” So They kept quiet, They kept quiet because they are sleeping. Now this is the thing is. On the right side if you are talking loudly, if you talk too much, if you intimidate people with your talking then you catch on right Vishuddhi. So for that best is to take some rest and give some rest to your right Vishuddhi by stopping your talk. Go into mauna they say, just don’t talk. For some time if you don’t talk you will see that your Vishuddhi will be improved, your problems will be improved."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1989-0814 Shrī Kṛiṣhṇa Pūjā, Secondary School, Saffron Walden, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image486.png" /></div><p style=" text-align:center;"> <font color="blue">"First and foremost thing is, that we must speak in a sweet manner.<br /> Speak to someone in a sweet manner, not artificially, but sweetly.<br /> <b>Speak in a manner that another person likes it: “satyam vadet, priyam vadet” [speak the truth, speak that which pleases].</b><br /> Speak the truth.

We may mentally think, “Oh, I’m doing all for God’s sake I’m doing this.” That’s just our imagination. But you just don’t do it, because the karma has to become akarma, means ‘non-action’ – that’s only possible when you get your Self-realization.<br /> When a self-realized Soul gives you Kuṇḍalinī, he doesn’t say – raises your Kuṇḍalinī, doesn’t say, ‘I do it.’ He says, “It’s rising, it’s going, it’s working out.” In the third person he talks, so the whole thing becomes akarma. Then He says that “Whatever are the flowers and things like that you give Me” – that’s the bhakti yoga – “I’ll take it.” But He uses only one word on which He has made everybody dance, and that word is ananya – <b>Ananya Bhakti: "When there is not the other, when you are united with Me."</b>"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1990-0315 Public Program, University, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī:</b> So this Viśhuddhi on the right-hand side is to be controlled by surrendering as it is said, actually you surrender your ego to begin with. And this ego when you surrender, it has to be done from you heart, it should not be a lip service. From your heart: “I don’t want this ego any more, I want reality. Let the reality be seen by me, felt by me, enjoyed by me.” And once you start doing it from your heart you’ll be amazed that your voice will become sweet. Apart from that it will have the Divine Power flowing through it. That is what we say that you have now got Vāk Śhakti, means ‘the Power of Speech’. So when you surrender ego, what do you do actually is to say that, “I’m not doing anything, it is You who do everything.” So that a little drop has now become an Ocean.
