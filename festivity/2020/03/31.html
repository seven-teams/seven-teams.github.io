It was Mahālakṣhmī who incarnated as Mary and Jesus Christ was nobody else but Mahāviṣhṇu. If you want to know about Mahāviṣhṇu you must read Devī Bhāgavat[am].

That is why it is said that: “You are to pass through the Gates of Heaven only with the Grace of Christ.”</b> Of course, that doesn’t mean churches, it doesn’t mean at all churches. That you understand as Sahaja Yogi: that you have to pass through the Āgñyā chakra. Ultimately, that’s the most difficult point where human beings had to pass. Because at the Āgñyā chakra your ego and superego are fully grown. At the human stage only this ego is developed. Now, how to overcome the ego was a point.

So, this Collective Subconscious is the one, which contains all that is the past, all that is there. Now there are many vegetables, which went out of circulation of evolution. These when they enter into our being exist within us because everything that is past and future exists within us. So, once they enter into our body, we get these virus infections. Virus comes from these things, which are of the past and they enter into us and pull us towards the Collective Subconscious and that’s how we get the symptoms of virus and you know that virus cannot be treated. It has to be allowed to pass out. So they just enter into our being and pass out.<br /> ......<br /> Now, when you start moving too much towards the left, due to the activity of the left side, means a person who is very emotional or who bows to wrong type of people.<br /> That’s why it is said don’t bow your head to wrong type of people.
