It’s the Ocean that is going to nourish them. And the same Ocean is going to guide them. So the connection between a drop and an Ocean has to be fully established. So the limitations of a drop have to be absolutely dissolved into the greatness of the Ocean.<br /> <b>With care and with nice things to say we can improve the depth of the collectivity, and with sincere desire to be collective.</b> The desire to be collective has to be very sincere.

Because as you ascend, you get all the rest of it. Because you do not ascend, you not ... you do not get what is needed. That’s why there are problems. And even today I had to solve some problems before I could come to Pūjā.<br /> But <b>if you decide that we have to ascend spiritually within us, then everything that you have to receive, all the blessings that God wants to shower upon you, to make you the citizen of His Great Kingdom, where you are no more judged, you are no more chastised, you are no more put to any test, but where you’ll reside in Eternal Love of God and in His glory.</b>"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1983-0321 Birthday Pūjā, Āśhram, 10 Clarence Street, Burwood, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia </b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image341.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>Thank You for descending from Your heavenly abode, Mātā Dwipa, to bring light into the darkness of Kali Yuga.<br /> Thank You, Śhrī Mātājī, again and again.<br /> Thank You for giving Sahaja Yoga to a confused and self-destructive humanity.<br /> Thank You for revealing to us the meaning of creation and evolution.<br /> Thank You for revealing to us the actual existence of God.<br /> Thank You for giving divine meaning to human existence.<br /> Thank You for revealing to us within the human body the reflection of the Viśhwa-rūpa (universal form).</b></font><br /> <font size="+0"><font color="DarkGreen"><b>Shubhmangalmaye diwas hai āya</b></font></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"In these modern times, to have such bhaktas, itself is a big blessing for Me. So as you say, “Mother, bless us,” I say, “You also bless Me.” You have already blessed Me by this beautiful arrangement you have made, the way you have put yourself, surrendered yourself for this great Pūjā. Because all is such an interdependent process. You do the Pūjā. I can’t do the Pūjā. <b>You have to do the Pūjā. When you do the Pūjā, the chakras are awakened. Mine are awakened, but in you they are awakened.</b><br /> Now how to explain to people what is the importance of Pūjā is. If you have not tasted the fruit of a Pūjā it is impossible to explain. It is at a higher level only one can understand all these things. But so far whatever was done was at such a lower level by such low type of people that everything became absolutely unholy. It was all unholy doing and because of that unholy doing God Himself is unhappy.<br /> So He has created this Universe to create realized Souls, not to create useless people, not to create people who do not believe in God, who do not believe in higher life, who do not believe in leading a life of purity. He never created this Universe for them. They are just existing, just like dead people. They are not living people. <b>So those who believe in God, those who worship Him with all purity, are actually, in a way, giving blessings to God because it is so pleasurable for Him to see that they have understood, that they have felt it, that they have liked it.</b>"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1983-0330 Birthday Pūjā and Havan (English+Marathi), New Marine Lines, Churchgate, Mumbai, Mahara</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image342.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>Thank You for comforting us.<br /> Thank You for counseling us.<br /> Thank You for correcting us.<br /> Thank You for never abandoning us.<br /> Thank You for saving us.<br /> Thank You for gathering us.</b></font><br /> <font size="+0"><font color="DarkGreen"><b>Janam. din. ayo, Ādiśhakti ka</b><br /> Ādi Śhakti's birthday has come!<br /> <b>Smaran. din. ayo, Nirmal. bhakti ka</b><br /> The day of recollection of Divine devotion has come!</font></font><br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GAqyLEuQ24&amp;feature=youtu.be">video</a></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"This is what I have to tell you today, on this day where you are celebrating, that you celebrate your own birthday.

Whatever is needed for you to be there, is not needed now because you are in that joyous mood. All right? So, only thing, a very short Pūjā, I have told him, is to be done today is a birthday. There is no need to have a huge, big Pūjā, all that is needed to bring out all the Deities. They are already there, up there, just see the vibrations They are emitting! They are so very happy that you are celebrating My birthday. So, in every Pūjā what we have to do is to awaken Them, ask Them to be kind to you, this, that.
