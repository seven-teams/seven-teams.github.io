Through this path we attain the Śhiva Tattwa. So Śhiva Tattwa is the destination and the path is made by Lord Viṣhṇu. This central path is the creation of Lord Viṣhṇu and the Ādi Śhakti; Lord Śhiva has no role in it: He sits comfortably in His seat, without bothering for anybody; if someone wishes to come, may come. To attain Śhiv Tattwa we should go through this Viṣhṇu Path (Suṣhumṇā Path) and correct all the centers that are created on it. When the centers are cleansed, the Viṣhṇu path opens up and our ascent begins. Many a times I have told about all these centers. There is a center in Heart, which we call ‘left Heart’. This is not the center of the heart. In a way it is the reflection of Śhrī Mahādeva in the heart. <b>The abode of Śhiva is above our Minds and Thoughts.</b>"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1999-0214 Śhivarātri Pūjā, New Delhi, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image361.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>We pray to Lord Śhiva to look after our Union.

I forget all that was in me before, just lift me up. You raise me up. Everything I have dropped out, no other desire but just lift me higher. Make me Your servant. The rest of it is not important. All the other manifestations of this desire are over. Now I am absolutely surrendered to You, my Spirit. Lift me higher and higher and higher.
