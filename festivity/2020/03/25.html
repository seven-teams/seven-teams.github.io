Gaurī had to come first to establish Gaṇeśha. But Gaṇeśha is always put before even Gaurī. Before the Pūjana of the, worship of the Gaṇeśha, nothing starts; because He’s the one who takes out all the obstacles, all the negativities, all the hurdles that are going to come up, all the attentions that are here and there.

This, unless and until it is fulfilled those who are seeking will never be satisfied whatever, they may do. Now, this center is very important because this was the first center that was created when the Primordial Being started doing the job. This is the center of innocence that is holiness. First thing that was created was the holiness on this Earth. This center is very important in all human beings because animals have innocence, they have not lost it while we have ... or we can say we have a freedom to abandon it. We can do it, we can somehow or rather destroy it by our so-called ideas of freedom.<br /> Now, this center has a power to give us wisdom. Now wisdom is such, such a word that cannot explained. Wisdom is the balance between your understanding of what is good and what is bad"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1981-0325 Public Program, Maccabean Hall, 146, Darlinghurst Road, Darlinghurst, New South Wales, Australia</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image347.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"Śhrī Gaṇeśha, please be kind and merciful and forgiving,<br /> that You manifest within ourselves.<br /> Let all these hypocritical things, all these conditionings,<br /> and all these wrong ideas we have,<br /> or all the wrong life we have had,<br /> just disappear like thin air;<br /> and let the beautiful moonlight of Your soothing qualities of innocence be manifested through us."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1990-0826 Śhrī Gaṇeśha Pūjā, Lanersbach, Austria</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Kuṇḍalinī is the Gaurī and we have got Gaṇeśha sitting in the Mūlādhāra chakra.

People have started talking against Mary by saying that there was something wrong, “How could a virgin get a child?” because we do not understand it is God and in the area of God anything is possible. They’re above all these things and they can create anything and in any way Gaṇeśha had to be born out of a virgin because He was so pure.<br /> So Kuṇḍalinī has to be supported by Śhrī Gaṇeśh. If Śhrī Gaṇeśha is weak, then Kuṇḍalinī cannot be supported. Śhrī Gaṇeśha has to support her in the awakening part first of all. When the Kuṇḍalinī is getting awakened, Śhrī Gaṇeśha stops all the functions that it has to perform."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1991-0408 Śhrī Gaurī Pūjā, Residence near Āśhram, Parnell, Auckland, New Zealand</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image348.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"The first center is the Embodiment of Innocence is called as Mooladhara chakra<br /> But Mooladhara itself is seated in the secram [sacrum] bone higher then Mooladhara chakra.<br /> Mooladhara meaning the support of the root is the abode of the mother Kund[a]lini."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b></b></font> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Auṃ Twameva sākshāt Śhrī Gaṇeśha sākshāt Śhrī Ādi Śhakti Mātājī Śhrī Nirmalā Devyai namo namaḥ</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are going to worship Śhrī Gaṇeśha.</b><br /> Śhrī Gaṇeśha resides in Mūlādhāra, on the chakra, Mūlādhāra chakra.

Yesterday you saw the picture, the drama, how Śhrī Gaṇeśha got his head of an elephant. All these things have happened in another world. There are many worlds of which we know of this world, is a question of our awareness. Now we are at a human awareness, and we have risen to a higher awareness which is called as the fourth dimension. Without Śhrī Gaṇeśha it is not possible. As you know he is the symbol of innocence within us. This innocence never gets destroyed because it is eternal. But it may happen that it will get covered with some clouds by our mistakes that we commit. But once you get your Realization, your innocence is re-established, it manifests. And you become innocent, your attention becomes innocent. It is impossible to follow your religion, either Christ or Muhammad Sāhib or Jews, if you do not have enlightenment. This is one thing they did not realize because they were of a very high-level people. They did not know what is the condition of human beings."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1994-0911 Śhrī Gaṇeśha Pūjā, Innocence and Love, Moscow, Russia </b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image349.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkGreen">"<b>So this New Year’s Day is the first day of advent of Goddess</b> – the nine days there are. <br /> ......
