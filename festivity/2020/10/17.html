Collect the Pūjā material and offer it sincerely. There should be no formality or bindings in the offerings.<br /> It is correct to wash hands, but is your heart washed?<br /> When attention is on heart it does not go to others. Although you remain quiet from outside, you are speaking from within. Hence you should not, be silent for long time. If man’s heart is not clean, then the silence becomes very harmful. At the same time, loose talks can bring catastrophes.<br /> You should say the Mantras in Pūjā but with great faith (śhraddhā). There is no alternative to śhraddhā. You should perform the Pūjā when śhraddhā grows deep, so that heart itself gets all Pūjā performed. At that time waves of bliss start flowing because it is the Spirit that is saying, how can any thought come at that time?"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1901-0000 Letter to Nirmala (Marathi) on the Meaning of Pūjā from Nirmala Yoga, Issue 12 (November-December 1982), Page 4</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image507.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="Indigo"><b>Namo Devyai Mahā-devyai</b><br /> Salutations to the Devī, to the Mahādevī,<br /> <b>NShivaye satatam namah,</b><br /> To You who is ever Auspicious,<br /> <b>NNamah Prakrutyai bhadrayai</b><br /> To You who is the Primordial Cause,<br /> <b>NNiyutah pranatah sma tam</b><br /> And the Sustaining Power, we bow to You.</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>Devī Sūktam from the Devī Mahātmyam</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"There are many miraculous things in the Realm of the Divine and in Pūjās.

What is Mother’s specialty? Her ego (aham) is nowhere felt by others. Hence Śhrī Gaṇesha who has surrendered to such Mother, is so wise and venerable, Mother has nothing with Her. Her very name begins with Ni, e.g., Niṣhakāñchan[ā] having no wealth, Nirlepā unaffected; Nirvichārā thoughtless; Niṣhprayojanā having no motives, Nigarvitā egoless, Niricchā desireless, etc.<br /> Therefore, surrendering to such Mother, who has nothing with Her, needs some kind of subtle thought, in that, Mother has nothing with Her and therefore, nothing can be asked from Her. It shows how Śhrī Gaṇesha by himself, is fully satisfied. Where does this contentment of Śhrī Gaṇesha come from? It is own power. When the gate of the Self opens, nothing else is required. It is the Mother who opens this gate and therefore, She is so dear to Śhrī Gaṇesha. Complete Self-realization is that stage attaining which nothing else is required. Thereafter, only enjoying the bliss and the satisfaction of fulfillment.<br /> <b>You are made in the pattern of Śhrī Gaṇesha. Therefore, your power is unmatched, but for that, you should have devotion and innocence like Śhrī Gaṇesha’s. Then Mother would admire you and the whole world would witness that beautiful sight.</b>"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1978-1002 Letter to All Sahaja Yogis (Marathi) (1st Day of Navarātri), London, UK from Nirmala Yoga, Issue 11 (September-October 1982), Pages 25 and 26</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image509.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkSlateBlue"><b>O Daughter of the King of the mountains!<br /> The sages say that the world has its dissolutions and Genesis<br /> With the closing and opening of Thine Eyes,<br /> Thine Eyes are bereft of winking,<br /> With a view to save from dissolution this entire universe,<br /> Which has its origin in the opening of Thine Eyes.</b></font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>('Saundaryalaharī' by Śhrī Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya)</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>On this day Devī is worshiped as Śhailaputrī, means the daughter of Himalaya.

She is called Satī because She entered the Holy fire of Havana and ablated Herself. But by then Lord Śhiva reached there. He lifted her burnt up body from the fire. Burnt pieces of the body of Śhailaputrī fell at many places. All these places are considered to be Śhakti Pīṭhas, the places of worship, as there is in Vindhyāchala and many other places.
