The time for their destruction has come, but how to kill them? I can take a sword in My Hands and cut off their heads. It is not a difficult job for Me. But they have entered into the hearts and heads of human beings, into their brains. They have all congregated inside, and are sitting there. The people are accepting them as gurus. What am I to do?

So with devotion and understanding, you have to do it. Because you are really privileged people, extremely privileged. Be proud of that, and do with that devotion all these things. Today is a very much better time because the Dussehra and the Navarātri’s, are both combined at this time. And so it has worked out very well. We should do it with full devotion.
