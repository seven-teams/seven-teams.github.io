The greatest problem of modern times is that these satanic forces have taken a very subtle form and they enter into your psyches and into your egos. And you are the Saints, you are the bhaktas, you are the devotees of the Goddess. It’s a very delicate situation. When the confusion is there, when the Saints are attacked, the aggressor can be removed, but the Saint becomes mixed up or confused with negative forces, which is very difficult to make him see the light. And you have seen this situation very well. And the subtler you grow, the subtler they became. And they start giving you ideas which are so negative, but you cannot see them.<br /> So the problem today is very delicate.
