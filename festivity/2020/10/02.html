You’ll be amazed, it is all based on the different chakras, one after another all that Bhajanāwalī will start from one to another. Is just like how we do it for our Kuṇḍalinī awakening.<br /> It is based one after another, from one chakra to another chakra, to another chakra, to another chakra, though he has not mentioned anything else. Apart from that, we in Sahaja Yoga, we have to take account of all the Incarnations, of all the Prophets, of all the great Primordial Masters, who came on this Earth and adjust accordingly the different movements of the Kuṇḍalinī. Because according so Sahaja Yoga all these Incarnations are within us, and they help us, and we have to awaken them. Same thing Gāndhījī has done, is to tell us that we have to look around, we have to know Bible, we have to know Gītā, we have to know all these great Scriptures and great people, and integrate.<br /> Of course, that part is left to Me, is the actualization of what he wanted to do. Though he definitely had prepared the base economically, then political base also. He never believed in aggression. Never. And he said that sharing should be brought. He always believed even capitalism should be conquered through enlightenment. Though he was so busy with this emergency job of saving the whole nation, that he could not pay much attention to the subtler side of Sahaja Yoga, which I call awakening of the Kuṇḍalinī of Self-realization.<br /> But he always talked of, he always said about it, most surprising, he’s the only one I have seen so far who was not doing Self-realization, but was so close to it and could see clearly that Self-realization is the only way for emancipation of human beings. His values and his styles were so correct."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1979-0311 Public Program (English+Hindi), Day 2, Session 2 (evening), On Gāndhī and Collective Consciousness, Gāndhī Bhawan, Delhi University, North Campus, GC Narang Road, Timarpur, New Delhi, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image499.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkGreen">"India has now won back its democracy and the leaders are talking of Gāndhījī.

Most of these people, martyrs, even My father, mother, even Gāndhījī, they never cared for politics, they never wanted to do anything with politics. They said, “We don’t want to do anything,” but here was a man who ventured himself into politics and who was a realized Soul, was a very big combination for Me. And I could see the potential of this.<br /> If you ask Me, I can’t join politics. Shastrijī asked Me several times. He said, “Why don’t You come to politics?” I said, “It’s beyond Me. I just can’t.” And most of them were so much detached.

He died, and I felt that now all our greatness, all our traditions, all our culture, which has come to us from Saints; Indian culture has not come to us from Freud but has come to us from Saints.
