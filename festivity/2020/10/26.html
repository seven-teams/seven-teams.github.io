That’s why you know we do not allow many people to come for Pūjā, because that creates another whirlwind of rationality. Once you are detached from yourself, all your problems become so tiny as you see from the sky, from the aeroplane all the far-fetched things which are not so important. And the problems that are going in the houses down below do not touch you. You go beyond clouds and you live in the area of that space of Divine Love. Then all your petty things irritating things, all your so-called problems of live, all disappear and then only you can be effective more, much more effective, because you become a source of Divine Love. Pūjā is the only way I feel, you can stop your mental activity. Sahaja Yoga cannot be understood through rationality. Mentally it may be, but to become you have detach yourself completely. You have to go beyond it, because this limits your movement."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1980-0420 Pūjā, Significance of Pūjā, Flat of Marie Rouger, Paris, France</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image544.png" /></div><p style="color:DarkSlateBlue; text-align:center;"> <b>To The Devī,<br /> To The Mahādevī,<br /> We Bow Again And Again.<br /> Let Those Who Have Ears Hear,<br /> Let Those Who Have Eyes See,<br /> Let She, The Auspicious One, The Great Queen,<br /> Grant Us To Be Victorious in Spreading Sahaja Yoga.</b><br /></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>According to the calendar, this year there are ten days of Navarātri, not of nine.

I have told you many a times, now believe that you are Sahaja Yogis. Believe that you are, you have entered into the Kingdom of God. You cannot judge God, you cannot say why She does that, why She does that, why He does that. You cannot say that – that’s different. But when you sit there, then it is not an assembly, it is not like a politician fighting, no; it is that you have entered into the Kingdom of God, blessed by God, looked after, protected, nourished, and made knowledgeable.<br /> ......
