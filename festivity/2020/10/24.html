After crossing the seventh day, after crossing the seventh chakra – that is the real ascent in your spiritual ascent. What are we to do on the eighth one?<br /> It’s so Sahaja that today should be Aṣhṭamī, because that is the day the Goddess killed so may evil doers, and demons and rākṣhasas.

Now, of course, they are challenging us and saying all kinds of wrong things about us because they are frightened that they will be exposed. But Truth will prevail now. The time has come for Truth to prevail. It is surprising that people don’t understand that Truth is Love and Compassion. If you really love somebody, you know everything about that person, that is how the Divine Love is, which knows everything about everything. It is the knowledge that you get when you fall into the Ocean of Love, an Ocean, you fall into the Love’s Ocean. One has to know that Truth is what Truth is, you cannot change it, because it is absolute. You cannot transform it, you cannot sell it. You cannot pay for it.
