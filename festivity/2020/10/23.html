Like if you love someone, then you say something, just to please that person.<br /> In the same way you are saying to Goddess something. Now these Saints who have written are saying this. Just to express themselves that “You are Goddess, You are like this, You are that.” Some of the letters I receive also are like that. So much full of expression of their feeling. But it’s not a sort of a lecture course or anything. It is just the feeling of that attitude. So in complete ‘bhakti’ it should be done.<br /> Try to feel it in your heart, whatever is said, and that you are sitting before Me. You have to say that from your heart. This is what we are saying to You, with complete humility. It is the expression like a prayer. It is a prayer. Should be a prayer and not some sort of a[n] intellectual discussion.

Today is the 7th day of the Goddess.

What was the need?” The reason for doing it was because although human ascent was still low, yet their aspiration was very high. They aspired to achieve the Ātmā through the body. That is why they worked so hard and did penance in this place. It is due to their aspiration that today we are able to achieve this height. This does not mean that we should think that because of the blessing of Sahaja Yoga we are some great people or some specially chosen people by God. People who think like that will receive a great shock. You will see that those who are simple, innocent, and good-natured will ascend foremost and the rest will be left behind. Therefore just receiving your Realization is not the end.<br /> <b>On this auspicious occasion, God Almighty has manifested all His śhaktis for your protection, benevolence and welfare. In everything God is blessing you. He wants to see you enter His Kingdom.</b> In a way it is His Desire that you should return to your Father’s home and enjoy its comforts.
