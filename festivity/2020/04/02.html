All the knowledge about Kuṇḍalinī you have, very clearly, without going to any college, school, university, anywhere. Without going to any laboratories you have experimented with it, you’ve found out what is Kuṇḍalinī. You have seen with your own eyes, you’ve seen the rising of the Kuṇḍalinī, you have given Realization to people.

Śhrī Rāma has taken the place of father hence if there is lack in the responsibility or love from father this chakra is caught. In Sahaja Yoga we to understand that Śhrī Rāma and all other Deities have taken the form to fulfill their divine work, in all Śhrī Rāma had a special task. As it was said by Socrates that the Benevolent King has to come the same way Śhrī Rāma had come on this Earth as benevolent king, He came in the form of human being, He even forgot that He was Incarnation of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, forgot about Him but for all world He was Puruṣhottama Rāma.<br /> <b>In Sahaja Yoga we need to know when we pray any Deity, we have imbibed the specialties and qualities of the particular Deity within us, Śhrī Rāma had many qualities.</b><br /> You all know his childhood life and you have already heard about his qualities, he was Puruṣhottama he had another quality that in his ruling, he did not care for his wife or children’s in front of his subjects view."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1991-0325 Śhrī Rāma Pūjā (Hindi), Kolkata, West Bengal, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image387.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="blue"><b>"......

He is the one who gave leadership as a benevolent king, the one who represents God and who is a king. The idea of a king related to God came from Śhrī Rāma. But the modern kings are not like that, they have no relation with God.<br /> On the contrary, they are horrid people. Some of them are nothing but satanic people, absolutely Satan is there and you can see from the way they lead their lives, and they have led their life before. So the benevolence of Śhrī Rāma is here [shows the right Heart] to be followed by all the political leaders and all the people who are at the helm of affairs. He is the ideal that was created for human beings, to run their authority as the head, or the loving compassionate benevolent leader of the people, who has to govern them by making them respectful, by respect. And if human beings create such things who are not respectable, those who have no human values, those who have no moral courage, those who are selfish, those who are self-centered, then they have nothing to do to be there.<br /> <b>So this is the position of Rāma who is the Father.</b> So the head of every state has to be the father of his subjects, that’s what He has tried to show by His life.

So the right side was created by the Advent of Śhrī Rāma because he showed a path of creating among people the awareness that they should be ruled, that they should not be anarchists, there should be one head who should be able to organize, coordinate and work out a collective thing. ...The desire of all the people which is the good, righteousness, incarnates as Śhrī Rāma and He looks after that will."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1982-0402 Śhrī Rāma Pūjā, Rāma Navamī, Āśhram, 44 Chelsham Road, Clapham, London, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image389.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="blue">"Also you must protect yourself, all of you: always give yourself a bandhan; always lead a clean life.
