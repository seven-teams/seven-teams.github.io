Of course, not this, it is inside on the crossroads of optic chiasma, you can say, which there is a center called as Āgñyā chakra. And this center looks after your pituitary and pineal body.

In the center is a very subtle point which moves both the sides like this and like that and it creates two sounds ‘Ham’ ‘Kṣham’, ‘Ham’ ‘Kṣham’, ‘Ham’ ‘Kṣham’. ‘Ham’ is on the right-hand side where you have seen the superego is there and ‘Kṣham’ is on the left-hand side where the ego is. <b>Now these two sounds create two kinds of vibrations.</b> I would say the mantra for the right-hand side is ‘Ham’ and for the left-hand side is ‘Kṣham’.<br /> ...... Now the superego on the left-hand side and ego on the right-hand side is ‘Kṣham’.<br /> The right-hand side is the ego, which is real problem, you understand that!<br /> ......<br /> <b>Those who have ego must learn, if they feel hurt they must say, ‘forgive’. Then another person hurts them, say, ‘forgive’. And not only forgive but ask for forgiveness.</b> Both things should be done, more asking for forgiveness. You have to ask for forgiveness if you have too much of ego. It is very important. Because if you have too much of ego means what? That you have pampered it too much. That means you have used it too much. You have dominated people and that’s why you have such a lot of ego. If you have such a lot of ego you must all the time try to humble down in your heart. Now in the heart resides the Spirit. <b>The ego, too much of ego in a person, always takes you away from that Spirit.

If you understand really, in the way that I call it part and parcel, what is a Bodha – that is, it becomes a part and parcel of your nervous system, that you are a Yogi then no virus can attack. What is virus? Nothing can attack you, nothing can trouble you. And even if they attack, it will come for a short time and will go away. Even if they attack, it will come and go away.

What flows through you is the pulsation of the Spirit. And you can see the pulsation flowing through you through which you can judge your own centers and the centers of the others, because you jump into a new awareness called as collective consciousness. Actually, it is actualization.<br /> ......<br /> It’s an actualization within you that you start feeling others within you, that you know that we are part of the whole. Not through your brain, but through actualization in your awareness it happens. Unless and until that happens to you, you are not to believe anybody. We are seeking the wholesomeness, our wholesomeness. We are seeking our relation with the whole. We have to become the whole. For that, there is this mechanism placed within you, and when this happens, you start feeling the whole. And this is what is you are seeking.<br /> But actually what happens [is] that it works on you like a human awareness, you get another awareness which you can call as superconsciousness. But there are other consciousness which we can call as the subconscious mind and the supraconscious.<br /> Like in the past is the subconscious. <b>Supraconscious is the future.</b> That’s on the left and the right. You can start moving on these lines. And there could be some spirits, some dead spirit, they may jump on to you and you will start behaving in such a manner that you cannot control. What is going to happen is that the Kuṇḍalinī rises very smoothly within you and gets that state. You become that.

But it is such a vicious circle that, through your eyes, you gather all the bad, and is accumulated in the Āgñyā and you have to clear the Āgñyā to make the eyes clear. It’s a vicious circle. But it can start at a point as I said, we have to ask for forgiveness. Secondly we have to bring Christ in our Āgñyā chakra. Thirdly we have to give up all drugs and all intoxicants and all smoking.<br /> That happens automatically when you are a Sahaja Yogi, it will work out. But eyes express the whole of your being, your brain, your body, your limbs everything. And if your Āgñyā is all right then your eyes are perfectly all right. They emit nothing but love wherever they glance. Only with a glance of your eyes you can raise the Kuṇḍalinī. Only with the glance of your eyes you can cure people. Only with your glance you can bring joy into the destroyed and the ruined people.<br /> So these eyes which you see are the windows of your being, of your heart. When the Spirit is expressed through your eyes, you must have noticed yourself that, when the Kuṇḍalinī rises then the eyes become dilated."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1978-1218 Public Program,10 Caxton Street, Westminster, London, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image385.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>Shrī Mātājī:</b> Now what are good My feet for?<br /></font> <b>Sahaja Yogi: Āgñyā.</b><br /> <font color="DarkRed"><b>Shrī Mātājī:</b> Very good for ego.
