Salutations to You!</p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are going to celebrate the birthday of Mahāvīra.</b> Mahāvīra is the Incarnation of Bhairavanāth, or you call Him as Saint Michael. Now these two Saints as you know one as the Gabriel, Hanumāna, and another is Saint Michael. One is placed on the Piṅgalā nāḍī and another one, Saint Michael, on the Iḍā nāḍī.<br /> So, Mahāvīra had to go through lots of search. Of course He was a[n] angel but came as human being and He had to find out the thing of the left side, and how the left side acts. It’s a very complicated thing, left side, is much more complicated than right side."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1991-0328 Śhrī Mahāvīra Pūjā, Gidgegannup, Darling Ranges (45 kms NE of Perth), WA, Australia</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"The ascetic life of Mahāvīra was of a very, very extreme nature. He was the one who was born in a ... uh ... clan of warriors, Kṣhatriyas. And then He was also married, also He had a daughter. And then He decided, because He knew He had to do the work of the Divine, He decided to take a saṃnyāsa. So He took uh the permission of His brother because His parents were dead. He was a king, so He gave up all His uh material wealth, everything and He beg ... became a complete saṃnyāsī. And the He left His family, His left His ... house, everything behind and went alone with a little bowl for begging alms. And there people who joined Him were very few, and He asked them that, “You have to also become ascetics,” Munis.<br /> He was a Reincarnation of Saint Michael and He resides on the left side, on the Iḍā nāḍī. And He looks after the whole of it, right from Mūlādhāra onwards up to the Sahasrāra. <b>So Saint Michael was born as Mahāvīra, meaning ‘The Greatest Warrior.’ But when He was born, the whole place got lot of uh prosperity, that’s why He was called as Vardhamān, to begin with.</b><br /> But His asceticism was there because of the Brahminism that was so prevalent in those days, and people were absolutely drowned into it."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1990-0616 Śhrī Mahāvīra Pūjā, Ca’n Bosc (House of the Woods) (1 hour North of Barcelona), Spain</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image394.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="blue">"Now, why was He called Mahāvīra?<br /> Because only a person like Him – Vir means a person who is brave, who is chivalrous – because only He could do this, so only He could enter into the being fully and could kill or, you can say, destroy those horrible rakshasas, devils, all these negative things that come to us."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1991-0328 Śhrī Mahāvīra Pūjā, Gidgegannup, Darling Ranges (45 kms NE of Perth), WA, Australia</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"So we have to thank really very much Mahāvīra who has given us this power to remove our left-sided problems, who has given us this light in our hand which He Himself vibrates, and He Himself tries to throw some light on the obscure things – about Me also. Because of Him only we can get cured of so many physical and mental troubles. <b>You know that the left side can be easily cured if you use three-candle treatment. That shows Mahāvīra is only fond of light, He doesn’t like darkness.</b> And His idea is, I think that way, is to now fully go all the way to clear the left side as far as possible, to help Sahaja Yoga to be established in countries where I find still lot of this negativity is there, lot of it."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1991-0328 Śhrī Mahāvīra Pūjā, Gidgegannup, Darling Ranges (45 kms NE of Perth), WA, Australia</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image395.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="Maroon">Naman Kare Barambar Śhrī Mātājī</font><br /> We bow to You Śhrī Mātājī again and again<br /> <font color="Maroon">Gaye Mil Jayjaykar Śhrī Mātājī</font><br /> We all sing Your glory together<br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwTgcNtwAlI">video</a></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"Christ was, Himself was respected, you know that when He came, people bowed to Him on Palm Sundays, they laid down their cloths that He should walk over it."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1982-0321 Birthday Pūjā, Ashram, 44 Chelsham Road, London, UK</b></font></p><font size="+2"><b>Suggested Talk:</b></font> <font size="+0"><b>1990-0617 Śhrī Mahāvīra Pūjā, Barcelona, Spain</b></font><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjHXNpb8sVk"> video</a><br /></p><font size="+2"><b>Bhajans:</b></font><p> <font color="green"><b>21 names of Śhrī Bhairava recited (1991-0328 Śhrī Mahāvīra Pūjā, Perth, Australia)</b></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Tujhya Vina</b></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Jarī Asel Anta</b></font><br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aHXifIBHPs&amp;feature=youtu.be">video</a></p><p> <font size="+0">Jai Śhrī Mātājī!<br /> On behalf of the festivity team!</font></p></section><footer class="page__meta"></footer><nav class="pagination"> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/festivity/2020/04/02" class="pagination--pager" title="2020 Celebrating Śhrī Rām Navami: “Śhrī Rāma came on this Earth to establish the institution of benevolent king” ">Previous</a> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/festivity/2020/04/12" class="pagination--pager" title="2020 Celebrating Easter: “He created the Path of Resurrection for us.
