In foreign countries also Sun (Sūrya) is considered important. They use astrology, etc. based on Sun.<br /> So in Saṅkrānt, this happens, that on fourteenth day [of January], today, Sun leaves its place and goes to north. This is why people value Saṅkrānt a lot."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1996-0114 Makar Saṅkrānti Pūjā (Hindi+English+Marathi), Pune, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image293.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>Today is very special day because the Sun is particularly benevolent towards us on this day.

Saṅkrānti means that today there is something new going to happen. Kuṇḍalinī has awakened within you and you have become new person compared to what you were before. But on the day of Saṅkrānti, you should know that you have to please the Goddess who is sitting within you.<br /> What should you do to make Her happy? You distributed sesame seeds and jaggery. That is for love. To increase the love between each other, we give sesame seeds and jaggery.<br /> Today the Sun left its place and, in its northward movement, came towards us. At this moment we should be very thankful to the Sun. It is by the grace of the Sun that so many things take place in our country. We have to do namaskār to the Sun today and His Power and His knowledge should come to us.<br /> I would say that all of you have become realized and vibrations are flowing through you. Now you should make use of these vibrations, establish the śhakti within you, establish the peace within you and show the world that this power is within us and we have to acquire it. We have to nurture this, improve this with your good qualities and truthful speech."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>2008-0117 Makar Saṅkrānti Pūjā, Hall, Pratiṣhṭhān, NDA Road, Pune, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image294.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>"Saṅkrānt, krānt means revolution, saṅ means the holy.

He resides on the Sun. So how humble He was, how humble He was residing on the Sun. The more you live on the Sun, there should be much more humility. Of course, I must say in India, people are humbler. But still, the quality of Sun can make you extremely arrogant and very unpleasant person. This unpleasant person can really ruin all kinds of good relations. But the worst thing that happens to us, is that we lose our integration. Because when we say harsh things to anyone we feel guilty, so we have another problem, our heart feels bad, our liver feels bad everything is upset and thus you feel absolutely disintegrated. And this disintegrated is the sign of our not evolving at all, or we should say devolving.<br /> This integration is such a common thing that we see, in ourselves, we see that we fight with our ego, then we fight with our superego, then we fight with our heart with our emotions and all the time we are fighting within ourselves. So at least, within ourselves we should speak sweetly on this day."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1985-0114 Makar Saṅkrānti Pūjā, Suryavanshi Hall (near Śhivajī Park), Dadar, Mumbai, India </b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"So today we decide on peace. Peace with ourselves, peace with others and that is how we worship the Sun, <b>Christ the one who was the emblem, who was the absolute practical symbol of that peace.</b> And once you understand this, I am sure you will try to follow that instead of hitting everybody, getting angry with everybody. Just forget all these things.<br /> You have come here to ascend and your gain is your gain. Your fighting is not your gain, remember that. Your quarreling is not your gain. The gain is the peace that you have achieved, the love that you have developed, the compassion that you can emit, the amount of relationship and the rapport you can penetrate into others. This is your gain which we have to receive today, a mind, a heart like a lion and not chicken-hearted people. Not people who would be angry and this, to boast of your anger. These days are gone, we boast of our peace, we boast of our contentment, we boast of our glory and we boast of our state. And that is the state where we are now in the Kingdom of God."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1985-0114 Makar Saṅkrānti Pūjā, Suryavanshi Hall (near Śhivajī Park), Dadar, Mumbai, India </b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image295.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>So today’s special day, a very great day. Let us ask that – when you are doing this Pūjā, ask for new religions within you to be enshrined, to be sustained within ourselves and try to imbibe them.<br /> They will be permeating but you have to accept them. And [you] should know it’s a big fight; and it’s a very different type of a fight of peace and love. That’s why they say: “Speak sweetly.” Be sweet. Not to be sarcastic by any chance, nor to be harsh, but be sweet.<br /> Sweetness which is genuine, not outward and shui [showy] and formal, but genuine sweetness.<br /> May God bless you all.</b></font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1981-0114 Makar Saṅkrānti Pūjā, Sadashiv Peth, Pune, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"For India, today is a very important day because the Sun is coming from the south to the north side. The most important thing in Sahaja Yoga is that you have to change and that’s what you should do to the Goddess with changed heart, full of love, affection, and kindness. Therefore, hope you will spread Sahaja Yoga. It is very important – because you know My vision is too big and you have to really work hard to fulfill My vision. And to give Realization to people as many as possible. You have to think what is your mind doing. There are many people who are waiting to come in Sahaja Yoga. You should have the light of spirituality; you have to feel that you are spiritual, you have to grow it, and also make others grow.<br /> Sahaja Yoga is not limited with you. It’s not meant for one individual, not at all for one person but for the whole world. We have Sahaja Yogis all over the world, but they don’t spread Sahaja Yoga. They are satisfied with their own motives. This is not Sahaja Yoga. You must openly talk about and say about it.<br /> But Sahaja Yogis are very shy, they don’t talk about Sahaja Yoga. They can do it, no doubt.<br /> The Sun changes its direction, everybody knows about it, everybody prays for it. People take bath in the River Ganges for purification. This is all right. Now it is a time for purification, identification and also of understanding the importance of Sahaja Yoga. I don’t know how many people really understand the importance of Sahaja Yoga. If that is understood, one can do a lot of work in Sahaja Yoga. It is such a noble work, which you all have to do it collectively; and then you feel your life has a meaning, otherwise there is no meaning and no light in your life. So you have to work out in that manner which gives inspiration to others. You must have introspection, ask questions to yourself – what I have done for Sahaja Yog."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b></b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image296.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>Jāpakusuma Sankasham Kāśhyapeyam Mahadyutim Tamorim Sarvapapaghnam Pranatosmi Divākaram</b></font><br /> Salutations to Lord Divākara (the Sun), who shines like Japākusuma (Hibiscus) flower, who is son of Kāśhyapa (and Aditi, hence Āditya),<br /> who shines brilliantly, who is the enemy of darkness, and who destroys all sins.<br /> <b>Navgraha Strotra</b><br /> (Stotra for the Nine Planets.
