It was done with very great care and great adjustments.</b><br /> It is not in the limits of human understanding, how things are worked in the heavens. It is your fortune and God’s Love that has worked out this wondrous miracle. Without this happening, there could not have been a possibility to give [en] masse Realization to people.

This area is all surrounded by thousand nerves and when these nerves get enlightened they look like flames of VIBGYOR colors, seven colors, and very mildly, beautifully shining, emitting peace. But when the Kuṇḍalinī starts emitting its vibration on the sides, all these nerves get enlightened gradually and start moving on all directions, opening the Sahasrāra. And then the Kuṇḍalinī ...<br /> ... emerges out, emerges out through the fontanel bone area, which we call as Brahmarandhra. Randhra means the hole. And the Brahma is the All-pervading Power of God’s Love."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1991-0505 Sahasrāra Pūjā, Sports Stadium, Island of Ischia (1 hour from Naples), Italy</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"Sahasrāra is your awareness. When it is enlightened you get into the technique of the Divine. Now there are two techniques: the technique of the Divine, and the technique that you follow. You cannot act as Divine, but you can use the Divine Power and maneuver it. For example, Divine looks after all the universal happenings. Every minutest particle is controlled by Divine. When your Sahasrāra opens out and your Kuṇḍalinī touches the fontanel bone, sort of a igniting force is ready in your Sahasrāra, and as soon as the fontanel bone area opens up through the Brahmarandhra, the Grace of your Spirit ignites that igniting force and your nāḍīs get enlightened. Not all of them, quite a lot of them; not all the length, but quite the peripheries. That's how you get your enlightenment."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1982-0505 Sahasrāra Pūjā, Opening the Primordial Sahasrāra, Āśhram, 9, Allée Du Rocher, Le Raincy (13 kms E of Paris), France</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image427.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Jagat.

As you have known in Devī Māhātmyam that “at Sahasrārare Mahāmāyā comes.” She’s a Mahāmāyā: not easy to recognize Her, not easy to know Her. She lives just like you. She moves just like you. And you can never make out Her real nature. She is in the form of Mahāmāyā.<br /> ......<br /> <b>So, in Sahasrāra Pūjā, actually, you have to recognize your own divinity, that you are divine, by experiencing your divinity. How do you experience your divinity? That you give Realization to others.</b><br /> It’s a great experience to give Realization to others. Not only that you give Realization but you can tell about their chakras, you know what’s wrong with them. You are quite confident."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1991-0505 Sahasrāra Pūjā, Sports Stadium, Island of Ischia (1 hour from Naples), Italy</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"So My own effort was to take you into that beautiful arena of Sahaja, where you will be absolutely one with your Self, one with the nature, one with the ... all the people who are around you, with your own country and countries. Everywhere, in the whole atmosphere, as they say, the whole Brahmāṇḍa [universe] becomes part and parcel of you, and you are not separated from that. Then, they ... we can say the echoes – they call nināda – the echoes of your being, of your life can be easily seen, not in material advancement or in any other kind of a thing, but in the spiritual area which is the highest. Or everywhere, in every country, there have been people of that quality, and, till today, they are all remembered. In the same way, you all will be representing a very great knowledge about reality: in your life, in your creation or in your working. In every way you can do it."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>2000-0507 Sahasrāra Pūjā, Albera Ligure, Italy</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>Sahaja Yoga teaches how to love and adore the human body as the temple of God Almighty.</b><br /> Sahaja Yoga is the working of the Unconscious and there are some very stupid people who think they can cheat God.
