And the method for individual Realization was just the opposite of the collective. First, they had to establish their dharma, cleanse themselves fully, desiring all the time for their salvation, putting their attention to their salvation, as you call it Īśhwarapraṇidhān [desire for God], thinking of God, asking for His Grace and acting in a scrupulous, dhārmik ways to keep themselves pure. They had to control their mind, control their desires, control their action in such a manner that they absolutely kept to the center path. And when they could get through all that testing and immunity, I mean they deserved, then only the Grace of Mother gave them Realization.<br /> This pattern was on for some time. These few people who got Realization did lots of wonderful things to prepare for Sahaj Yog. They were in every field of life, but very few and unique."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1980-0505 Sahasrāra Pūjā, Āśhram, 8, Hamilton Road, Dollis Hill, London NW10 1NX, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image416.png" /></div><p style=" text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Tucha Kharokhar.

And to move it on the horizontal level, we have to understand how to go about it.<br /> Like the seven colors of the rainbow, we have got seven colors of the light of these centers, of the chakras. And when we start it from the back, from the Mūlādhāra, bringing it up to the, this side, Āgñyā, then it is placed in a different order, if you see it clearly.

We have reached to the end of it now. The whole logic has ended up now. Jump in the Ocean of Love. Finished!'<br /> Once you jump in the Ocean of Love there’s nothing to be done!

Once it is discovered that we are detached in our witnessing state, then automatically the pure love starts flowing. As soon as you get your light, the sunlight, all the fog disappears. In the same way, as soon as you get Spirit shining in your attention, all your doubts, all your mistakes, disappear.
