And today I see all of you so much engulfed in the Divine Love and Divine Power.<br /> <b>The whole thing shows one very great, fundamental thing, of Sahasrāra: that people from so many countries integrated together.</b><br /> Integrated. It was sahaj, spontaneous, but every way and there was no confusion, there’s no quarreling, no fighting, nothing. Such an integration, spontaneous, whether it is on the stage or stage of life.<br /> Now, as we are all global personalities, we are all integrated and those who were acting were enjoying as well as the ones who were looking at them were also enjoying in the same manner.<br /> It was such a good also integration between the one who was acting, or the all those who were there, and all those who were watching – I couldn’t understand whether the people who are seeing them are also acting, or also those who are acting are also seeing.<br /> It was a beautiful blending I must say, and I congratulate all the leaders of all these five countries, who have contributed so well to this deep sense of integration.<br /> Not that is the integration within that is important – of course that’s very important for a personality, but for our work, for our global emancipation we need integration of all the nations, and understanding of all the nations, because these barriers are created by human beings, not by God Almighty.<br /> So we have transcended those barriers, and the way we are all sitting together in a complete integrated mood is – you don’t know what your Mother feels, I, I just can’t believe that in such a short time this we have achieved, in My lifetime I can see all these things happening.<br /> So it was such a beautiful sahaja, spontaneous, creation of the Spirit of this integration, and I congratulate all the leaders for this, and we all should thank them, for giving us this beautiful integrated, sahaj spontaneous illustration of [the] sahaj character.<br /> Thank you very much.<br /> May God bless you all."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1996-0504 Talk to Sahaja Yogis, after the Evening Program, the day before Sahasrāra Pūjā, Hangar, Cabella Ligure, Italy</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image412.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>"Just to say, ‘Mother, it’s all Yours,’ to start it – 'It’s all Yours.<br /> I am Yours, my heart is Yours, all my things are Yours, my life is Yours.'<br /> Even saying that is a big mantra for Sahasrāra.</b><br /> The Deity of Sahasrāra is a very simple person, extremely simple, and can be moved with very little actions,<br /> can be pleased with very few little actions here and there.<br /> Not much is needed to please the deity of Sahasrāra.<br /> It’s a very simple person. Little things make Her happy."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1987-0503 Sahasrāra Pūjā, Kosciuszko National Park, New South Wales, Australia</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>Sahaj Yog is the Union between you and God, and the sincerity must be full, must be complete.</b><br /> Any kind of insincerity which comes into you is extremely detrimental. So you must know that, as your Mother has sincerity about you, you must also have sincerity about yourself. Then you will start enjoying Sahaj Yog. That [sincerity] is very important to create integration within you. Because if it is sincerity, it comes from your heart. If it is coming from your heart, then your body, your mind, your intelligence, everything willed [will] work hard to fulfill it. But if it is not coming from your heart, it is going [to be] just [a] sufer-ficial [superficial] thing.<br /> So you try to feel it from your heart: that’s what it means sincerity. Do not depend on anyone: your wife, husband, children, nothing, mother, father. It’s your own!<br /> So, you have to work in such a way that you get complete integration. And the driving force towards integration is a very simple one: is sincerity. Thus, you will know that automatically you are getting integrated."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1980-0505 Sahasrāra Pūjā, Āśhram, 8, Hamilton Road, Dollis Hill, London NW10 1NX, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image413.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Tuzhya Krupe Nid.Rit.

You cannot integrate nonsensical things together. Integration is only possible of the people who are of the same style, or of the Deities who stand for God. You cannot have satanic people and godly people integrated, can you? You cannot unite these people. You try it and you’ll have problem. That’s the best way you see the destruction of every unity. So in Sanskrit is a very good, good word got for integration, samagra, beautiful word which means, agra is the, agra is the hole in the needle, and when a thread passes through this needles, it passes through the agra, so it is samagra. And this integration has to take place as soon as you cross over. And because of this you get your Realization and you feel all the chakras are enlightened. Unless and until you pass through this fontanel area you cannot feel the All-pervading Power."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1981-1006 Public Program, Unity Church of Christianity, Unity Drive, Houston, TX, U.S.A.</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"The most important thing in Sahaja Yoga is that you have to change and that’s what you should do to the Goddess with changed heart, full of love, affection and kindness. Therefore, hope you will spread Sahaja Yoga. It is very important – because you know My vision is too big and you have to really work hard to fulfill My vision. And to give Realization to people as many as possible. You have to think what is your mind doing. There are many people who are waiting to come in Sahaja Yoga. You should have the light of spirituality; you have to feel that you are spiritual, you have to grow it, and also make others grow.<br /> Sahaja Yoga is not limited with you. It’s not meant for one individual, not at all for one person but for the whole world. We have Sahaja Yogis all over the world, but they don’t spread Sahaja Yoga. They are satisfied with their own motives. This is not Sahaja Yoga. You must openly talk about and say about it."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>2001-0114 Makar Sankranti Puja, Pratishthan, Pune, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image414.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Prana-tanam prasida twam</b><br /> O Devī, the remover of the afflictions of the universe,<br /> <b>Devī Vishw'arti-harni</b><br /> Be pleased with us who are prostrating at Your Lotus Feet.<br /> <b>Trailokya vasinam'idye</b><br /> O Devī, who is worshipped by the dwellers of the three worlds<br /> <b>Lokanam varda bhava</b><br /> Please grant boons to all the people.</font><br /> <font color="DarkRed"><b>Auṃ Twameva sākṣhāt Śhrī Sahasrāra Swāminī sākṣhāt Mokṣha Dāyinī sākṣhāt Śhrī Ādi Śhakti Mātājī Śhrī Nirmalā Devyai namoh namaḥ!</b></font></p><font size="+2"><b>Suggested Talk:</b></font> <font size="+0"><b>1987-0503 Sahasrāra Pūjā, Thredbo Village, Kosciuszko National Park, New South Wales, Australia</b></font><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&amp;v=E_oFfLVr9C4&amp;feature=emb_logo"> video</a><br /></p><font size="+2"><b>Bhajans:</b></font><p> <font color="green"><b>Tujhacha Mātājī Pare Prakasha antari</b></font><br /> Tujhacha Mātājī Pare Prakasha antari<br /> Let your light come within us<br /> Tujhecha Sahaja Yoga He phire Jagavari<br /> Let us thus spread Sahaja Yoga in the whole world<br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6n3LlVckLE"> video</a><br /></p><p> <font color="green"><b>He Nirmala Mā, He Nirmala Mā</b></font><br /> Tera pyar. moksha ka Anand. hai Mā<br /> O Divine Mother, Your unbounded love is the bliss of liberation<br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7T1xpKkYFU">video</a></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image415.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> (Bombay Beach house, 1970: after the opening of the Sahasrāra)<br /> <font color="DarkMagenta"><b>Thank you for revealing to us the true meaning of good and evil.<br /> Thank you for awakening Mother Kundalini in us.<br /> Thank you for opening the dimension of collective consciousness to us.<br /> Thank you for giving us Self-realization.<br /> Thank You for establishing vibratory awareness on our central nervous system.<br /> Thank You for nourishing us with the all-pervading power of God Almighty.</b></font></p><p> <font size="+0">Jai Śhrī Mātājī!<br /> On behalf of the festivity team!</font></p></section><footer class="page__meta"></footer><nav class="pagination"> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/festivity/2020/04/25" class="pagination--pager" title="2020 Celebrating Akṣhaya Tṛitīya: “Akṣhaya Tṛitīya, means un-destructible third day of the moon.
