And then You enjoy that pining, that longing to see Your own, Your own children whom You love so much. Is such a great joy.<br /> In these modern times, it is described that in this Kali Yuga everything will go upside down because people will not recognize the motherhood. The mothers won't be respected and won't be respectable either. Is a fact.<br /> And imagine now this has brought this Mother's Day to this country. It's something, such a recognition from the Divine that one has to remember that motherhood is very important.<br /> ......<br /> <b>So the power that your Mother has, of giving birth, the spiritual birth, be bestowed upon all of you so that you do this work with the same grace and with the same patience and love and enjoyment.<br /> May God bless you.</b>"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1980-0316 Talk to Sahaja Yogis (Mother’s Day in UK), Āśhram, Dollis Hill, North London, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image335.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>The Mother is everything</b> — She is our consolation in sorrow, our hope in misery, and our strength in weakness.<br /> She is the source of love, mercy, sympathy, and forgiveness.<br /> And this Earth is the Mother of the trees and flowers.<br /> It produces them, nurses them, and weans them.<br /> The trees and flowers become kind mothers of their great fruits and seeds.<br /> And the Mother, the prototype of all existence, is the Eternal Spirit, full of beauty and love.</font><br /> <b>(Kahlil Gibran: "Broken Wings")</b><br /></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"[Mother's is] a very special institution ...... especially in this country [Italy], they have such respect for their mothers.<br /> <b>Mother is the Source of Love.</b> In the Qur'ān they asked Muhammad Sāhab whom should we bow after Allah? So He said "to Mother" -- "to the Mother."<br /> Then again they asked Him, He said: "Only the Mother." Again they asked Him, He said: "Only the Mother."<br /> I'm sure He must have said about the Divine Mother, because worldly mothers may not be complete mothers, perhaps. They are a[n] embodied, or, we can say, examples of Mother's Love, of the Divine Mother's Love, but they are human.<br /> So they can be conditioned, influenced or could be egoistical, especially if they are living in a particular country for a long time and have no idea of Divine Love.<br /> In Divine Love there is no expectations, it just flows, it doesn't think how to judge a person or what to do for a person, it just flows."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>2001-0513 Talk to Sahaja Yogis (Mother’s Day), Living Room, Palazzo Doria, Cabella Ligure, Italy</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image436.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>The most beautiful word on the lips of mankind is the word “Mother,” and the most beautiful call is the call of “My mother.” It is a word full of hope and love, a sweet and kind word coming from the depths of the heart. </b></font><br /> <font size="-1">(Kahlil Gibran)</font><br /></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"Today is ... I like the day when it is the Mother’s, I should say, Mother’s Day also. Because I think only a Mother can work it out that way. One has to have a lot of patience with people.<br /> .......<br /> But mother’s position is different. She’ll go on struggling and fighting for her child. She’ll fight it out to the last to see that the child gets all the benefits and this patience and this love and this forgiveness is innately built-in in a mother, because her attitude is very different. Not any achievement, not any big name or what you call a sort of an award or anything. It is just she does it because she is a mother. And that is what is the sign of any mother, if she is a real mother, at least for her own children, she will go all out, she will work out everything for day in day out and to save the child from disaster. But Sahaja Yoga is a much bigger family and for that you really had to be worked out through the Mother’s Principle. You cannot take any other principle.<br /> ......<br /> So, in your own way, when you are doing Sahaja Yoga, there also you have to be a mother. <b>More mother’s quality than the father’s quality, that there’s no ambition, there’s no competition, there’s no jealousies, nothing.</b> Just you want your children to come up and to grow into their spirituality. If that is the only attitude we have then you’ll be amazed how satisfied you’ll feel, because this is a very, very joy-giving thing, to see people growing in spirituality. Not only talking about it, not only reading about it, but actually happening, actualizing within yourself. So this quality is very helpful and that really helps every Sahaja Yogi to be patient, to be kind, to be humble."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1998-0510 Sahasrāra Pūjā, Hangar, Cabella Ligure, Italy</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image437.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="Purple"><b>Thank You</b> for letting us participate in the salvation of mankind.<br /> <b>Thank You</b> for giving us the joy of introducing a yearning seeker to Your redeeming Motherly Love.<br /> <b>Thank You</b> for inviting all of us to the court of the Goddess.<br /> <b>Thank You</b> for establishing the Kingdom of God on Earth.<br /> <b>Thank You</b> for accepting our offerings and prayers.<br /> <b>Thank You</b> for showering Your blessings endlessly upon us.<br /> <b>Thank You</b> for being ever-present.<br /> <b>Thank You</b> for being gentle.<br /> <b>Thank You</b> for being wonderful.<br /> <b>Thank You</b> for being in our hearts.<br /> <b>Thank You</b> for being our Guru.<br /> <b>Thank You</b> for being our Mother.&lt;/b&gt;<br /> <br /> <b>Sākshāt Śhrī Ādi Śhakti Mātājī Śhrī Nirmalā Devyai namo namaḥ!</b></font><br /> (The 108 Thank You's offered to Śhrī Mātājī during 1996-0505 Sahasrāra Pūjā, Italy)<br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP_R9tpOVag"> video</a></p><font size="+2"><b>Suggested Talks:</b></font> <font size="+0"><b>1980-0316 Talk to Sahaja Yogis (Mother’s Day in UK), Āśhram, Dollis Hill, North London, UK</b></font><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzZQ4Kn4SpU"> video</a><br /></p><font size="+0"><b>1987-0510 Talk to Sahaja Yogis, Mother's Day Picnic, Galston (36 kms NW of Sydney), New South Wales, Australia</b></font><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ezzMPrC3A"> video</a><br /></p><font size="+2"><b>Bhajans:</b></font><p> <font color="green"><b>Mother I Adore You</b></font><br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsWaC7NktHA">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Isi Liye Mātājī hamko</b></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Vandan Karuya Mātājīla</b></font><br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybCnMcQi2ZQ">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Namostute</b></font><br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30F02gXLuGw">video</a></p><p> <font size="+0">Jai Śhrī Mātājī!<br /> On behalf of the festivity team!</font></p></section><footer class="page__meta"></footer><nav class="pagination"> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/festivity/2020/05/07" class="pagination--pager" title="2020 Celebrating Śhrī Buddha Jayanti ">Previous</a> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/festivity/2020/06/05" class="pagination--pager" title="2020 Celebrating Śhrī Kabīra Jayanti: “He brought forth so many fundamental truths in His poetry and He talked about it” ">Next</a></nav></div></article></div><script src="https://seven-teams.github.io/assets/js/main.min.js"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', '', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script src="https://unpkg.com/vanilla-back-to-top@7.2.1/dist/vanilla-back-to-top.min.js"></script> <script>addBackToTop()</script></body></html>
