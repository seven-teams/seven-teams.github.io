So one has to understand that it’s not just the movement of few people, chosen people, just to achieve Self-realization. But it’s a big revolution which has to bring forth the beauties of human beings, the glories of human beings, the proof of Divinity, of Divine Power and of God Almighty.<br /> We have to now face that multitude of people who are absolutely ignorant compared to you, who have not known the knowledge of God, who are either lost into the darkness of ignorance or are burning in the fire of ego. We have to transform this world into a new world, a beautiful world which you all are enjoying, to establish, to be established on this Earth for which we have to prepare ourselves."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1988-1225 Christmas Pūjā (English+Marathi), Gaṇapatīpuḷe, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image584.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>"Christ was the Embodiment of Paramachaitanya,<br /> He was Auṃkāra.<br /> He was Śhrī Gaṇeśha."</b></font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>2001-1225 Christmas Pūjā, Gaṇapatīpuḷe, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"Today is the great day when a great Son of the Goddess was born, at least it is celebrated today. And you all are assembled here to celebrate the birthday of Christ. You already know how He came on this Earth, and what was His great work. But we must see to the subtle side of Christ. What was His Power?<br /> <b>Christ’s Power was of course Auṃkāra. His Power was Praṇava.</b><br /> <b>But the essence of Christ was tapasyā, tapasvitā. He is the Incarnation of tapasyā.</b> And in that Incarnation is a sinless personality. He’s sinless. Of course Incarnations never commit sins."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1987-1225 Christmas Pūjā (English+Marathi), Muktangan Bal-Ranjan Kendra Hall, Parvati Paytha, Aranyeśhwar Nagar, Pune, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image585.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>"So the first thing that was said about Christ throughout in all these music and songs you’s have heard now is that ‘Peace on Earth’: He came to create peace on Earth."</b></font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1981-1225 Christmas Pūjā, Āśhram, 44 Chelsham Road, Clapham, London, UK</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are going to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ.</b> He came on this Earth in a very special way, that He was born to a Virgin. And we can understand as you know as Śhrī Gaṇeśha was also born in the same way, and as Jesus is a[n] Incarnation of Śhrī Gaṇeśha He had all His Powers when He was born, He did not have to bring any outward weapons to show that what powers He had. But He had all the powers with Him, but still He tried to show tolerance and understanding because at that time the people with whom He had to deal were absolutely ignorant of spirituality."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1999-1225 Christmas Pūjā, Gaṇapatīpuḷe, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>He has given the Greatest Weapon that we must forgive.</b> Now it’s such a practical thing to forgive. If you just forgive, the person doesn’t exist anymore and the person doesn’t trouble you anymore, nor is he in your attention, just to forgive is a simplest thing to do and the highest thing to do to get relief from worldly or mental tortures that we get.<br /> His life has been a story of spirituality, going through all kinds of turmoils and tortures, all types of troubles that the Spirit can go through, to show that nobody can kill that Spirit, as it’s said in the Gītā: “Nainaṃ chindanti śhastrāṇi, nainaṃ dahati pāvakaḥ, Na chainaṃ kledayanty āpo, na śhoṣhayati mārutaḥ” [Bhagavad Gītā 2.23]. It cannot be killed, it’s an eternal life and He tried to prove through His life the eternity, from the beginning to the end He showed that Spirit is above matter, that nothing can dominate Spirit.<br /> It’s a very big thing He has done for us is to create such a big confidence in our Spirit. He has proved it beyond doubt."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1986-1225 Christmas Pūjā (English+Marathi+English), Pavanā Dam Camp, Pune, Maharashtra, India </b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"The birth is very, very symbolic. Because He’s nothing but Chaitanya, He’s nothing but the Word as you call it, Logos, I don’t know what all words you have got in language, the Śhabda [Word, Logos], as they call it, is the Auṃkāra, He was to be born in this way, because He has no body. And the subtlest of subtle He had to be. Because the work was very subtle, sūkṣhma, that’s why He was born like that."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1981-1225 Christmas Pūjā, You Have to Be Peaceful, Āśhram, 44 Chelsham Road, Clapham, London, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image586.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>It was a living example of a very Great Advent that He came on this Earth and led such a pure and holy life.</b><br /> Try to develop your purity and holiness and a powerful holiness and a powerful auspiciousness which does not get contaminated, but fights whatever is anti-God, whatever is anti-Christ."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1982-1225 Christmas Pūjā, Pune, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"I have to now request you all to say, to understand that <b>when we are celebrating the birthday of Christ we have to imbibe his qualities, his subtleties, his nature.</b><br /> Also, I will request Indians, because they are also becoming westernized now, thinking that Western people are the wisest. They have to understand also that we should try to be subtler and subtler and not gross and this is what is important in Sahaja Yoga Culture. In Sahaja Yoga Culture, our attention is on the subtle. On the beautiful varieties of subtle. See all the sweetness and the goodness, all the artistic, esthetic projections of human life. Not the gross, not the grotesque. It’s going to be a new culture for us.<br /> We have started the Dharma all right. But every dharma has to have a culture and we are the Culture of Sūkṣhma, of the subtler life. That doesn’t mean we should be untidy or in way funny type or funny people. Subtler people are the most beautiful, are the most congenial, are the most idealistic, and are the most honorable like Christ. So for us the ideal is Christ. Of course, I don’t expect you to crucify yourself. But always be able to sacrifice, coping with all the discomforts and problems and not talking about yourself, not worrying about yourself, not discussing others and judging others, but giving assurances that now we are at this level, we’ll be at a higher level and all the world has to come up to that level. Very positive talking, very positive thinking and very positive doing is the way you can really follow Christ. Whatever He had to do, He did it with such great sense and beauty. That is what it is. So we have to be born like Christ today. We are all born like Christ because we are born without a Father, by the Holy Ghost, just like Christ was born.<br /> But look at Him and look at yourself, born the same way as He was born. So you must respect yourself as He respected Himself. And the way He worked out His Resurrection, in the same way you all have to work out your Resurrection, and that is very important."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1987-1225 Christmas Pūjā (English+Marathi), Muktangan Bal-Ranjan Kendra Hall, Parvati Paytha, Aranyeśhwar Nagar, Sahakamaka 2, Pune, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image587.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>"Today you have to ask just one thing from Me, that ‘Oh, Mother, today we ask You to give us that power of uh penance, of tapasyā, of Christ.’ I wish this would be granted today and you will become tapasvi[n]s.<br /> May God bless you."</b></font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1987-1225 Christmas Pūjā (English+Marathi), Muktangan Bal-Ranjan Kendra Hall, Parvati Paytha, Aranyeśhwar Nagar, Pune, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><font size="+2"><b>Suggested Talk:</b></font> <font size="+0"><b>1998-1225 Christmas Pūjā (English+Hindi+English+Hindi), Become Thoughtlessly Aware, Gaṇapatīpuḷe, Maharashtra, India</b></font><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-uvJuq5QWw&amp;feature=emb_logo&amp;ab_channel=TeachingsofH.H.ShriMatajiNirmalaDevi"> video</a><br /></p><font size="+2"><b>Bhajans:</b></font><p> <font color="green"><b>He Prem Murti</b></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a><br /></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Reciting Devī Mahātmyam</b></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Jagi Tarak Janama Ala</b></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Mahalakshmi Ashtakam</b></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Namo Namo Maria</b></font><br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zExNokrpbF0&amp;ab_channel=VIOLONISTUL">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Jai He Jai He Jai He Devī</b></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Ek Ganapati</b></font><br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpAg0HUPE9M&amp;ab_channel=VIOLONISTUL">video</a></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image588.png" /></div><p style="color:DarkGreen; text-align:center;"> Our Father, who art in Heaven,<br /> Hallowed be Thy name.<br /> Thy kingdom come,<br /> Thy will be done a On Earth, as it is in Heaven.<br /> Give us this day our daily bread;<br /> And forgive us our trespasses,<br /> As we forgive those who trespass against us;<br /> And lead us not into temptation,<br /> But deliver us from evil;<br /> For Thine is the kingdom,<br /> The power and the glory.<br /> For ever and ever, Amen.<br /></p><p> <font color="red">Wishing you all Merry Christmas!</font><br /> <font size="+0">Jai Śhrī Mātājī!<br /> On behalf of the festivity team!</font></p></section><footer class="page__meta"></footer><nav class="pagination"> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/festivity/2020/12/24" class="pagination--pager" title="2020 Celebrating Gaṇapatīpuḷe Festival: “I should say tonight is the Christmas eve and we are all here. …… He was the Embodiment of all that which was so necessary before the creation started” ">Previous</a> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/festivity/2020/12/26" class="pagination--pager" title="2020 Celebrating Gaṇapatīpuḷe Festival: “The music that was used to please the Gods and Goddesses, was used to please the kings and the queens.
