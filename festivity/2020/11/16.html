Whatever you are, do not identify yourselves with that, but whatever you want to be, try to be that.<br /> When you become one with the Spirit, all your problems will be solved.<br /> Sahaja Yoga is different from the other Yogas because it begins with Self-realization instead of this being the unobtainable dream of a distant goal.<br /> Without dharma, you cannot have the ascent. And the cleanliness of your being depends on how much dharma you follow religiously.<br /> The object of Sahaja Yoga is basically to become and experience the spiritual Self which is the true Self."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1900-0000 Nineteen Quotes from the e-mail booklet Come the Mother Calls!</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image562.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is a day we celebrate in India where relationship between brothers and sisters have to be established.</b><br /> They’re very pure.

Is the second day is the moon, that is the moon came out of the sea. According to this mythology, the Lakshmi came out of the sea and with Her this moon came out, which was only a two-day-old moon, the new moon but a two-day-old moon, and this was regarded as the brother of Lakshmi, because they were born at the same time from the sea. So He is the brother of Lakshmi. It's all symbolic; this is very, very symbolic."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1980-1109 Diwālī Pūjā (Bhāūbīj Day), The Mahālakṣhmī Power, Temple of All Faiths, Hampstead, London, UK</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"Now the last day is very important, is a very universal day I should say, called as Bhāī Dūj, this day, or they call it also in Marathi Bhāūbīj, different names. The brothers and sisters day. Now the brothers’ and sisters’ relationship has to be very, very strong. And the purity of that relationship is to be maintained.<br /> It is not necessary that you should be born as brothers and sisters, not necessary. But you are born, because if you are realized Souls you are born as brothers and sisters. So that purity must be maintained in the society of Sahaja Yoga. Very important, that we should try to develop this situation that brothers and sisters are something very pure. Their relationships are very pure. And they should not be at all challenged. It is so much so that even if you call somebody your brother, he is your brother and the more you develop this relationship, the better your left Viśhuddhi will be. Because left Viśhuddhi is the relationship with God as a brother or with a Goddess as a sister."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1981-1101 Diwālī Pūjā (5th day after Diwālī Day), The Mahālakṣhmī Powers and the Powers of Water, Āśhram, 44 Chelsham Road, London, Clapham, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image563.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"Rakṣhābandhan Day, they give a symbolic expression to their desire that their brother should be good.<br /> <b>But on this day they worship their brothers, actually worship them.</b>"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1980-1109 Diwālī Pūjā (Bhāūbīj Day), The Mahālakṣhmī Power, Temple of All Faiths, Hampstead, London, UK</b></font><br /> <br /> <font size="+0"><b>Bābā Māmā (1990 March): This is what the brother has written for the sister: "O Nirmalā, my sister, how much should I praise You?

And Absolute Purity within us should exist between our relationships when we call them as Sahaj Yogi brothers and sisters. And as there is understanding, complete understanding between the brother and sister, in a family, one has to know we are all part and parcel of a family, born out [of] the same Mother.<br /> Nobody has to shoot off, you know, nobody has to become something great, nobody has to correct others, nobody has to uh say that, ‘I’m something unique.’ All of you have to work it out together and find out the solution working out together, in complete friendship and unison. Anyone who cuts off himself and goes out or becomes anything else, goes out of circulation and useless for Sahaj Yoga. Such a person is completely useless: the one who tries to get out of the family. All of you have to be supporting as each other, helping to each other, not shouting at each other, [not] getting angry with each other, trusting each other, not finding faults, treating each other with respect [unclear and love]. This is the most important thing, which Sahaj Yogis don’t understand, that you are Saints and you have to respect each other."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1980-1109 Diwālī Pūjā (Bhāūbīj Day), The Mahālakṣhmī Power, Temple of All Faiths, Hampstead, London, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image564.png" /></div><p style=" text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>"So, for today’s New Year, let us vow within ourselves, that the selfishness or the self-centeredness or the smallness in you is finished."</b></font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1981-1231 Talk to Sahaja Yogis, New Year's Eve, Āśhram, 44 Chelsham Road, London, Clapham, UK</b></font><br /> <font color="DarkGreen"><font size="+0"><b>Ādi Śhakti Mātājī tere Charano meaya hu mein</b></font></font><br /> <font size="+0">Ādi Śhakti Mātājī I have come to Your Lotus Feet</font><br /> <font color="DarkGreen"><font size="+0"><b>Shyam Savere gun.
