I already told in My previous lectures what are these five days are. After killing Narakāsura, Diwālī was celebrated when it was the darkest night of the year.</b> So now, it is very symbolic of these modern times because the worst time, as far as morality is concerned has been in these modern times. We call it the ghor Kali Yuga – ghor Kali Yug, the worst modern times. That means a complete darkness and, as you see around, you’ll find out that there is complete darkness as far as morality is concerned, but that’s why there are all kinds of crises. Because of that, also, there are many who are seeking the light, the Truth."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1994-1105 Diwālī Pūjā (Bhāūbīj Day), Lights of Pure Compassion, Istanbul, Turkey</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>Śhrī Rāma’s crowning or any other aspect of Śhrī Lakṣhmī here now becomes your crowning, that is now you have entered into the Kingdom of God and once you are there then automatically as the citizens of God’s Kingdom you are blessed and as you become the lotuses then you start spreading your fragrance all around.</b> Now you do not keep this joy to yourself but you become generous about it and you go all out to give it to others. Generosity at another level, at a lower level is transformed into this Universal Love. Whatever you gain, whatever joy, satisfaction, vibrations, knowledge, all that you want to give it to others. You want to spread it because now you got the reality and you don’t want to keep it to yourself, you think it is very important that everyone in the world should know about reality.<br /> This is significant in putting these lights, that now you are the lights. It is the darkest night today, tonight is the darkest night, in the same way these are the darkest days, this is the Kali Yuga and it is the core Kali Yuga, the worst time where the worst things are happening, human beings are going to the worst level and at this time we have to put Sahaja Yoga before them. You know what is the ordeal one has to go through to break the hard nuts of the brains of people, but it is working, it has clicked already.<br /> ...... Now you have to enlighten many lights, we call it Dīpawali, Diwālī is dīpāwali, means the rows of lights, and by celebrating this Diwālī with so many of you I’m sure we’ll have such a torch of light which will go around the whole world. Just remember you are not a small drop, now you have become the Ocean and you have to spread. Now you are sitting on your thrones and assume your powers.

So there are, as I said many aspects, but one of them very important is that Śhrī Rāma killed Rāvaṇa on ten days before they say and was crowned on the ..., I mean today He was crowned today. So His wife was Sītā, She was also made the Queen, and in Their life it is shown how She remained absolutely dedicated to Him.<br /> So in Sahaj Culture we have to be special people, we cannot be like other people who are just running after money and doing everything just to ruin themselves. So that in Sahaj Culture we have to meditate, get our satisfaction about everything within ourselves and also we have to be like the Lakṣhmī children, the children of Lakṣhmī.<br /> So there are two aspects of this thing we have understood is that Lakṣhmī fulfills all our monetary needs plus also she gives us all the balance, all the joy, all the bliss in the family. Now the problem is with us that unless and until we meditate, unless and until we reach that state of satisfaction we cannot see the work of this Divine Power."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1992-1025 Diwālī Pūjā (Diwālī Day), Sala Olimpia (Olympia Sports Hall), Timişoara, Romania</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>Lakṣhmī is born out of the sea.</b><br /> Now, why She was born out of the sea? <b>She was born out of the sea because Her father [the sea] is a generous personality.</b> Look at the sea.
