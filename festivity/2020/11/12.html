It cannot be forced, as you know very well. It has to work out only with your desire, only with your surrendering.<br /> No use talking about it. No use convincing about it. What works out is your desire, simple as that. The power of desire within you works it out. There are many, who are not here, who have got their Realization all over the world. I remember all of them, and all of you should remember them.

These two things one should understand very, very clearly because we confuse them. Wife is the gṛuhalakṣhmī, is the one, she is the goddess of the household. Now she has to be the goddess also, I mean she just doesn’t become goddess just by becoming. You have to become again. You have to become the goddess. And, the Goddess of the Gṛuhalakṣhmī is, we can say, that the deity of the Gṛuha – of the house – is a Gṛuhalakṣhmī.<br /> Now, this deity must become one with the housewife. Then the blessings of the Lakṣhmī essence is of well-being comes to you. If she is not the Goddess, you will always suffer.<br /> You will always have problems; you will always have all kinds of untold miseries. It is Her blessings which brings you solace, peace and redemption – redemption is the word – of anything. So, that’s why the left Nābhī is very important as we know and that is always bad in the West. So, I would say that the whole society is responsible for spoiling that because housewife is not respected.<br /> First of all, we should blame our society. Our housewives are not respected. Housewife is the one who is a dedicated wife even placed higher than Yatis. Yatis are the highest evolved you can say, Avadhūtas, are the highest evolved seers. And, a dedicated wife has got more powers than even a Yati, it is said so."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1981-1027 Talk to Sahaja Yogis (Diwālī Day), Lakṣhmī Principle and Relationship between Men and Women, Āśhram, former Hotel, Bramham Gardens, Earl's Court, Kensington, London, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image553.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="MediumPurple"><b>"The Deity of Gṛuhalakṣhmī is Fāṭimah Bi, the daughter of Muhammad Sāhib."</b></font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1983-0131 Public Program, Day 2, The Nābhī Chakra, N.D.M.C.
