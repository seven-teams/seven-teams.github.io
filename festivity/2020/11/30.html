All the Saints of that age had the discretion to know who is a Saint and who is not. All the gurus incorporated their poems and experiences in Guru Grantha and that is why Guru Grantha is revered so much. Only the renowned gurus contributed to it. They were so spiritual that they did churning of all the religious Scriptures and put the substance in Guru Grantha. That is what we do in Sahaja Yoga. We do not follow any particular Saint or Incarnation; we respect all of them and strike a balance. But all this was lost in words. People did not go deeper in them. That is why Kabīra has written “even the scholars went on reading and reading like fools, without absorbing anything.” That is how a race of fools was created."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1980-0728 Public Program, The Principle of Guru (Moderation Is the Way We Really Solve the Problem and The Innocence Is in the Center), Sea is the Guru (The Sea Is to Be Worshiped and So Much to Learn from the Sea) and Your Dharma Is the Way Your Attention Is (Dharma Is Balancing), Caxton Hall, 10 Caxton Street, Westminster, London, UK</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkGreen">"So, these Ten Principles, as I told you, They established [dharma].

All of Them have created water in the desert or in the places where ... like in ... Nāṇaka has created a Pan̄jā Sāhab they call it, or everywhere They have been able to create water.
