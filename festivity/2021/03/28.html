He was very austere. Because of that, the society became very peaceful but people were devoid of all joy. So He thought that there should be a way by which people should be able to laugh freely and be joyful. And like it happens to all such ventures it happened in the case of Holī also that it produced an opposite effect.<br /> ...... <b>The story of how it started is like this.</b> There was a demoness called Holikā. She was the sister of Prahlād and Prahlād’s father used to trouble him a lot. Holikā had a boon that she would not be burnt by the fire. Prahlād’s father wanted to kill him and told Holikā to take the child [Prahlād] and sit on the burning pyre thinking that she would not die. But it is surprising that she died and Prahlād was not hurt in the fire and came out of it unscathed.<br /> This is a very big happening which demonstrated that it is very wrong to be cruel and aggressive. She had the boon but still, she got burnt. That’s why we have this custom on Holī. In our country [India] all such things have a lot of truthfulness. We have to understand that if we do wrong things, trouble others ... then these are demonic qualities.<br /> ...... We should not have these demonic qualities because we are Sahaja Yogis. We are a special race of people who have taken birth to transform this world and we should pay our attention towards that. We are very highly placed, higher than all others and we have to save all others from such tendencies. These days it has spread a lot. That’s why all such hateful, cruel behavior by which we dominate others, torture others is very, very bad and there is no need to do all that in Sahaja Yoga."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>2002-0329 Holī Pūjā (Hindi) (Holī Raṃgavalī), Palam Vihar, Gurgaon, Haryana, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image652.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>"So, today, on the Holi day if you only say the mantra of ‘Holika Dahan’ then with the mantra of ‘Holikamardinī’ you can wash My Feet."</b></font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1983-0329 Talk to Sahaja Yogis (Hindi), Raṃgavalī Holī Celebrations, Universal Sahaja Yoga Temple, Āśhram, 78 Kṛiṣhṇa Nagar, Safdarjung Enclave, New Delhi, India</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkGreen">"So, with Holī after dahan [scorching], like I said yesterday, let us decide today, that now Holī will be like Diwālī. The joy of it should be overwhelming. Why the joy of Holī? Although we burn just one Holikā but afterward, the joy flows in the Collective Consciousness, whether he is a sweeper or a garbage collector or even any other person working in the house. Like in My family, in Lucknow, from where My family belongs, these people are landlords. So the sweeper does not dare to enter inside the house. People don’t like them coming even their threshold, to that extent. They reprimanded them.<br /> But on the Day of Holī, any person, whether he is a master or a servant, anybody, they all play Holī together. Even if you tear the clothes of the master then also no one will reprimand you on the Day of Holī. This is the way a social and collective celebration of happiness started in our country."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1983-0329 Talk to Sahaja Yogis (Hindi), Raṃgavalī Holī Celebrations, Universal Sahaja Yoga Temple, Āśhram, 78 Kṛiṣhṇa Nagar, Safdarjung Enclave, New Delhi, India</b></font></p><p> <font color="Blue">"Always with Shri Krishna’s blessings you all should enjoy your Holi.

Every chakra has got different color. So what happens? These colors just get distributed in the air, in the atmosphere. During Holī time you [<font color="Orange">unclear</font> know you] are representing those colors which are completely permeating into the atmosphere. So this is another thing when you play colors. When you color another person, you are just expressing that these, your chakras will be blessed.</font> <font color="Red">Red</font> <font color="DarkRed">color is of the Mūlādhāra. All those colors that you use here are of different chakras. So just you are making the whole expression of your love that let it be you become completely filled with red color, means innocence, means innocence.

And </font> <font color="DarkGreen">abīra is the green color</font> <font color="DarkRed">of the Guru Tattwa. Like that all these colors have got significance that they are the colors of your chakras which you are spreading all over to your friends, to your other brothers and sisters who are Sahaja Yogis. So it has that symbolic expression that you are spreading your – actually the essence of your chakra, the basis of your chakra, the colors of your chakra, the fragrance of those chakras to other Sahaja Yogis.<br /> You just permeate, permeating. I don’t know in Hindi language if there is a better word like in Marathi udār, udār [bountiful, magnanimous]. Udār means just ...<br /> [Hindi.]<br /> ... red color, is the sign of innocence. So Kabīra says that, ``You put me into such a color. Oh, the one who is going to color me is the One." Raṅgarāj is the one who colors things. So He says, ``Oh Raṅgarāj, make me so that the whole thing becomes red -- innocence, fills me up with complete innocence." And innocence is the one he has asked for to be filled in. And same is with Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa that He played with all these different colors to show that there are different chakras within us apart from the red and the others that are there.
