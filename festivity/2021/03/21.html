When all the celestial bodies, the Eternal Personalities, Gods, and Goddesses, sing the praise, and that’s how the whole atmosphere is filled with mirth and happiness. Human beings also express their gratitude. <b>Expression of gratitude and love is done in different, different ways in different countries, but the substance remains the same and the forms change.</b><br /> The substance is like the ocean which flows continuously towards the shores and the ripples which touch the shores are again repelled back, and a nice pattern is formed. It is such a spontaneous thing and is so beautiful, creates such a beautiful pattern in the atmosphere. All these waves when they weave together the pattern of love they soothe human beings, they enchant human beings and the whole thing is very blissful.<br /> On such occasions, a special type of feelings develop, which we cannot express in words so the expression could be in any form. But the main thing is the expression. God has expressed Himself by Creation, by creating this Creation. While the Creation has to express its gratitude by glorifying Him, and this play must go on eternally. It’s the most beautiful play. Those who indulge into this play lead an eternal life.<br /> That life is unending, never breaks and binds the whole universe with its beautiful music."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1980-0323 Birthday Pūjā, Guarding Against Slothfulness, London BVB, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image646.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>"Many people have always asked Me that why God created this Universe ......<br /> ...... we can say that God created this Earth, just to please His own children, just to make them happy, just to make them enter into the Kingdom of God, to give all that what He has got.<br /> So He had to create this creation in such a way that He could create His own image, reflect it and make it enjoy itself."</b></font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1983-0330 Birthday Pūjā and Havan (English+Marathi), Birla Matushri Sabhagar, New Marine Lines, Churchgate, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><p style="color:DarkGreen; text-align:center;"> <b>RACHA PRABHU TUNEY YAHA BRAHMANDA SARA</b><br /> Oh God You have created the whole universe<br /> <b>PRANON SEY PYARA, BRAHMANDA SARA</b><br /> The whole universe is dearer than our lives<br /> <b>TUHI MAI BANDHU, TUHI JAGAT JANANI</b><br /> You are my Mother and brother, You are the Mother of the universe<br /> <b>SAKAL JAGAT MEIN YAH TERA PASARA</b><br /> The whole universe is but your form<br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbXMM__bZEI&amp;ab_channel=SahajaYoga">video</a></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today all of you have decided to celebrate My Birthday, for that I am thankful.<br /> Birthdays increase your age from one side and decrease your life from the other side.

Then you’ll go to any extent to justify it.<br /> We had people in our country, which is a very, supposed to be a very sober country, a very peaceful country, we had people who just believe in killing – kill this, kill that. So even in this country, which didn’t believe in all these things, indulged into all kinds of violence since long.

You all have got your Realization, that is, your Spirit is now emitting vibrations of peace and joy. Wherever you are, you will emit peaceful vibrations. You will create peace.
