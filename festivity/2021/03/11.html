This Pūjā should have been in the night!<br /> It’s a great night when Śhiva was established on this Earth. Because that way Śhiva is eternal. So one would say that, ‘Why Śhiva, like a Birthday of Śhiva you can say or something, how can it be? Because He is eternal! He is all the time there!’ So, what demarcates today’s celebration, is the establishment of Śhiva on this Earth. In the material self.<br /> Every matter has been created with a Deity in [it]. And that Deity is established in that matter as you know. So, then it was thought by Ādi Śhakti that first, you must establish Śhiva: <b>without Śhiva you cannot establish anything. First He is to be established because He is the Absolute</b>.<br /> <b>So you have to establish Śhiva</b>, and now what should we do? How to establish Him?<br /> He is the God of Tamoguṇa. He is the cold, He is the God of all that is not active. So, first of all, this Earth when it's receded from the Sun, which was very, hot was taken very near to the Moon. The Moon is the brother-in-law of Śhiva. So it was taken so close to Moon that the whole Earth got covered with ice.<br /> And it was then gradually moved towards the Sun. When it was moved towards the Sun, gradually, then it started melting. And the point that did not melt at all was the point where Śhiva was to be established.<br /> That was predestined, that spot, and that was spot is the Kailāśh. The ice never melts there, and if you see, the whole mountain is like the face of Śhiva – the eyes, the nose, and everything you can see clearly getting out – and all the year round it keeps its shape as it is.<br /> <b>That is how Śhiva was created.</b>"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1982-0222 Śhivarātri Pūjā, The Establishment of Śhiva on This Earth (We Have to Take Śhiva and Establish Him into the Virāṭ) and Śhiva Tattwa (What Makes Mother Pleased), New Delhi, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image637.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center"> <font color="Indigo"><b>Gireesham Ganesham Gale Neela Varnam<br /> Gavendrahi roodham Ganateeta Roopam<br /> Bhavam Bhasvaram Bhasmana Bhooshiangam<br /> Bhavani Kalatram Bhaje Panch.
