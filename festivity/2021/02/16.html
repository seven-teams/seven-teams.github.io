It acts in the stomach of the Primordial Being which is a Void, also referred to as the Ocean of Illusion (Bhavasāgara). (The way this Void was created is covered later.) Hiraṇyagarbha’s Power incarnates as Mahāsaraswatī, and the entire material creation is the product of Her power and activity: She created all the galaxies, stars and planets including our own Sun, Moon and Earth. She also functions as the thinking power of the Primordial Being, and this process generates the Cosmic Ego (Ādi Ahaṅkāra). The channel carrying this power is the Ādi Piṅgalā Nāḍī, and it expresses the Primordial Preconscious Mind (Ādi Chitta). It acts like a postman who carries messages to the intellect of the Almighty."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>The Book of Ādi Śhakti, Chapter 1: Creation, the Eternal Play</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we have the idea to do Saraswatī’s Pūjā.</b> [unclear] I have seen that here people worship Mahākālī and Saraswatī, people worship Devī and people are simple natured. We should worship Saraswatī as well.<br /> Saraswatī’s work is very great. First, Mahāsaraswatī created the entire universe. The earth element is special in this. The earth element has been placed in such a way between the Sun and the Moon that any living work can easily happen on it. From this living work, slowly and gradually human beings have been generated.<br /> But we should know our own great power. That power is what we call creation power, it’s also called creativity. This creation power is the blessing of Saraswatī by which many arts have been generated.

So the melodies were created.<br /> Melodies are fixed. You cannot change the melodies, the notes because they found out that, at this point, the Spirit awakened; on the vibrations they found out. They found out that, when they sang this way it worked out. The vīṇā [Primordial Instrument of Śhrī Saraswatī] they played and they found out the exact swaras. Exact swaras which would really make you feel nice.<br /> Now, you know that, those people have come from the West, don't understand any Indian music on the mental level but they understand at the spiritual level because their Spirits get filled with joy and the vibrations starts flowing."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1983-0202 Public Program, The Vishuddhi Chakra, New Delhi, India</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now Saraswatī is the Goddess of learning and Mahāsaraswatī is the Goddess of knowledge, which is Pure Knowledge.</b><br /> Now the Goddess of learning, Saraswatī, has got four arms.

So that’s one is vīṇā, and two other hands are: one has got a rosary in the hand, in the sense a person who is learned should be a person who should be very much detached.<br /> A saintly person should not have too many attachments and should not be – it always happens a person who is a learned man, who is overeducated, who is not so much interested in the family, he becomes more esthetic, is very discipline, self-discipline.
