No, you just don’t want it, don’t want to do anything because it harms others. People feel unhappy about it whether it is here, India, anywhere. You just feel that ‘Why should I do such a thing which is not so congenial to others?’ I mean, it’s not joy-giving.<br /> So when you have joy, you have to be joy-giving and if you are not joy-giving that means there’s something lacking in your Sahaja Yoga and that’s why we have to come up now.

And as there is understanding, complete understanding between the brother and sister, in a family, one has to know we are all part and parcel of a family, born out [of] the same Mother.<br /> Nobody has to shoot off, you know, nobody has to become something great, nobody has to correct others, nobody has to uh say that, ‘I’m something unique.’ All of you have to work it out together and find out the solution working out together, in complete friendship and unison. Anyone who cuts off himself and goes out or becomes anything else goes out of circulation and useless for Sahaj Yoga. Such a person is completely useless: the one who tries to get out of the family. All of you have to be supporting as each other, helping to each other, not shouting at each other, [not] getting angry with each other, trusting each other, not finding faults, treating each other with respect [unclear and love].<br /> This is the most important thing, which Sahaj Yogis don’t understand, that you are Saints and you have to respect each other."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1980-1109 Diwālī Pūjā (Bhāūbīj Day), The Mahālakṣhmī Power, Temple of All Faiths, Hampstead, London, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image844.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>So this is the fifth day is Dvija</b> [Bhāī Dūja].
