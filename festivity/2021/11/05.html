Now, why is it necessary to have a New Year Day in our life? While last year those who got Realization were very lucky people, but plodding through the path of Self-realization one loses all the enthusiasm and idealism that one has when you get Realization.<br /> You think of doing so many things about it. When you get Realization you are so much engrossed into it, you enjoy it so much that you think that, ‘Now! The time has come for me to do this and that and that, and I’m going to contact these people and I’m going to give this to news to this one, and I’m going to do this work and show to Mother that what She has given me, I have made it many folds.’ Because it was a new experience, great experience, the only experience that you have been waiting for. And that you also decide that, ‘I am going to now become the torchbearer of this great light that has come into me, and I am going to form one of the lights of this Dīpawali.’ Dīpawali, dīp means these lights, āwali means the row of lights. ‘So I am going to be one of them. And we are going to enlighten the path of the people who want to have Self-realization.’ All these great ideas come to us when we touch our depths.

You start changing your attitude.<br /> ...... So this attitude when develops in you, you should know that you are mature. This attitude is the only test to see that it is mature[d].

This is the Path of Compassion and Love.<br /> Through that compassion and love She creates this Path because She knows that if the Path is not wide enough the Kuṇḍalinī cannot rise. Ultimately, one reaches a state where you start seeking and when you start seeking, your Mahālakṣhmī Principle has been awakened. That is awakened and sometimes it is very strong.
