Seems it’s a very, very ancient idea and all over in the world, you see, whenever they have to celebrate something then they put lights. And lights because light gives joy, gives happiness. So to overcome the darkness of ignorance also we have to enlighten ourselves. And that is why is important that everybody should get Self-realization to feel the light within themselves. And you must have noticed that after Realization the eyes also sparkle. There’s light in the eyes of every Sahaja Yogi."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1990-1021 Diwālī Pūjā (4th day after Diwālī Day), Touch Your Depth, Chioggia/Sottomarina, Venice, Italy</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image831.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>This is a lotus you have made for Me here.

But the problems are there, as they say, but for us, there is no problem because there is no darkness, we don’t see any darkness anywhere, we see lights, and lights, and lights.<br /> Then what is the thing missing, missing is our sincerity. We have to be very sincere with ourselves because it is not just a borrowed love or a borrowed joy, but it is from within the source, it’s flowing, flowing, and flowing. So that is to be awakened, and that love should flow, and our small petty things like jealousies and competitions and all those things which spoil us must be washed away. And it can be washed if your heart is full of love.<br /> Today is a day of spreading love, light of love so that everybody feels enlightened and happy and forgets these petty problems."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>2003-1109 Diwālī Pūjā (16th day after Diwālī Day), The Need for Sincerity, Holiday Inn Express and Suites, 1080 Navigator Drive, Ventura, CA, U.S.A.</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image832.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>"The joy was dancing in your eyes.

That means She’s so benevolent, so kind that She doesn’t pressurize anyone. But normally you don’t find that. Anybody who has money, he’ll just try to pressurize or try to push down. Even in Sahaja Yoga, I’ve seen people like that. If they are little better off, they try to push people, organize them, to control them as if they think this is a power they have got out of the money that they have.<br /> But She Herself stands on a lotus – that means on the beauty. The beauty of Her being is shown that She doesn’t trouble anyone, She can stand on a flower. So the first thing, those who have to worship Lakṣhmī have to remember one thing that they are not to pressurize anyone, to push anyone, to control anyone, or destroy. But She with Her Feet on the lotuses nourishes the lotus."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1990-1021 Diwālī Pūjā (4th day after Diwālī Day), Touch Your Depth, Chioggia/Sottomarina, Venice, Italy</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>You know that today is the Pūjā of Śhrī Lakṣhmī.</b> Here nobody performs Lakṣhmī Pūjā. So, it must be understood that today is a very important day. <b>Lakṣhmī gives you everything. She is Mother. She gives everything, all blessings, all comfort, and most important is that She enlightens your inner being.</b><br /> So somehow you recognize Lakṣhmī. Lakṣhmī doesn’t mean money. You have to understand that She is a Goddess, and you have to respect money like a Goddess. In our country, people do a lot for the sake of money; wrong things that are very bad. But you have got a responsibility to recognize Lakṣhmī as Devī, and worship Her and understand that you cannot make fun of Lakṣhmī. Lakṣhmī blesses you and will go on blessing you. Such evil people are a few only, and you should be contented that Lakṣhmī resides in your being and has accumulated many moments of joy and comfort for you. You are going to get all that and have already got it.<br /> ...... I am sure that everyone will worship Lakṣhmī, and in the Lakṣhmī Pūjā, one should understand all forms of Lakṣhmī and what Her nature is. We cannot understand Her, and if we cannot understand Her, we will follow the wrong path. So it should be understood that She is Devī and that She is your Mother, and that She can do anything for you because She is very powerful and very affectionate, She doesn’t give you any problem. If you get trapped somewhere, She will save you. Such is the blessing [greatness] of Lakṣhmī."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>2008-1026 Diwālī Pūjā (Hindi) (Dhanatheras Day), House, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image833.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DeepPink"><b>padmalayam padmakaram<br /> padma patra-nibheksanam<br /> vande padma-mukhim devim<br /> padma-nabha-priyam aham</b></font><br /> <font size="+0">"I offer my obeisances unto the Goddess who is the abode of lotuses,<br /> who holds the lotus, whose eyes resemble the petals of a lotus,<br /> whose face is a lotus, and who is dear to the Lord who has a lotus navel."<br /> <b>Śhrī Lakṣhmī Stuti, from Viṣhṇu Purāṇa</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>And, today’s day is a very great day for us because the Saints are celebrating Diwālī.
