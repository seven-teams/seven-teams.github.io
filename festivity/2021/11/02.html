And the wick, as you call it – is called as bātī in Hindi language – is like your Kuṇḍalinī, so the Kuṇḍalinī had to meet the spark. The beautiful lamps were all a waste, purposeless, pointless. And this is the great blessings in modern times, that so many lights are enlightened and we are having a dīpāwali of human hearts. When you become the light, you don’t worry about the lamp, how it looks, how it is to be made, it’s all done. You just have to worry about the flame, about the oil, because it’s the oil that burns and gives light.<br /> Actually, after getting Realization, you just start spontaneously giving because you are the light. But respect your light and the light of others. The darkness is too much and we need so many lights to remove this darkness. These lights are to be maintained, to be looked after, to be loved.<br /> ......
