So the work of Bhairavanāthjī is to cool us down.<br /> For example, people have a hot temper with their ego, with their liver, whatever it is, and if a person is in a big temper, then Bhairavanāth plays tricks on that person to cool him down. He organizes everything under his own control with [the] gaṇas’ help, with Gaṇapati’s help, to cool down your temperament, to give you a balance."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1989-0806 Śhrī Bhairavanāth Pūjā, Bhairava and the Left Side, Garden, Āśhram, Garlate (40 kms E of Como), Italy</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image853.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"So what is it, that Bhairava is to be established. “Siddha kālā mane Bhairav” – as you have to establish Śhrī Gaṇeśha,<br /> you have to establish also Bhairava, and Hanumāna on the right side.<br /> If these three Deities you establish within yourself, nothing, nothing on this Earth can catch you."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1985-1026 Talk to Sahaja Yogis, Sahaja Culture, Āśhram, Bergenfield, NJ, U.S.A.</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"Jesus Christ possesses all Powers of Ekādeśha Rudras, that is Eleven Powers of destruction. These powers have their centers located around the cranium of our heads. When the Incarnation of Kalki takes place, all these Eleven Powers perform the work of destruction. Out of these Eleven Powers one is that of Śhrī Hanumāna, the other of Śhrī Bhairava. In the Bible, these two powers are named as Saint Gabriel and Saint Michael respectively. After Self-realization in Sahaja Yoga, one can awaken these Powers by addressing them in Sanskrit, Marathi, or even in English. The nāḍī on our right side, which is known as ‘Piṅgalā nāḍī’, is activated by the Power of Śhrī Hanumāna. Whenever any sort of pressure or constriction develops inside this nāḍī, it is instantly relieved <b>by Chanting the mantra of Śhrī Hanumāna. Similarly, even by chanting the name of Saint Michael one would experience relief in the Iḍā nāḍī. Iḍā nāḍī is on our left side and manifests the Power of Saint Michael or Śhrī Bhairava</b>."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1979-0927 Talk to Sahaja Yogis (Hindi), Kuṇḍalinī and Lord Jesus Christ, Navarātri Celebrations (6th Day), Hinduja Auditorium, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkGreen">"It is such a pleasure today, and great fortune that here, where William Blake lived, and He sang those songs of the greatness of this country, the future that it has to be, the dreams He saw, have now come to shape, that we are here to celebrate His anniversary. Things go beyond words – you cannot express yourself. Many people do not understand Him because He wrote it, according to them, in abstract language, or in the language that He understood. But I am happy that Sahaja Yogis understand Him so well, and the prophesies that He made about England."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1981-1128 Public Program, You Are the Spirit, Friends Meeting House, 120 Heath Street, Hampstead, London NW3 1DR, UK</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkGreen">"He was an Incarnation, of Bhairavanāth. That’s whom you call the Saint Michael, or Sanit George, who is as you know the Saint – Angel of England. That’s why He had to incarnate and for Him, this was His role, to talk about Divine in a open, fearless manner. He had to use symbolic language, He had to use. It’s not difficult to understand Him at all; if you are a realized Soul, you’ll read through it, sometimes laughing, sometimes weeping, enjoying the whole drama, what He has tried to explain. When I read Him I am amazed at His sense of humor; how He openly comes out with such remarks. I feel He is like Markandeya in India, or Kabīr Das in India, who slashed the whole society with their sword all the time to see that they are brought to the proper shape, without fear. But so gentle, if you read the Song of the ‘Thel’ [from ‘The Book of Thel’ by Śhrī William Blake], it’s so gentle; and all of them who were Him perhaps or of the same style, extremely open, straightforward, you can say even blatant and extremely gentle."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1985-1128 Public Program (Śhrī William Blake's Birthday), Building the New Jerusalem, Hammersmith Town Hall, 1 Riverside Gardens, Hammersmith, London W6 9LE, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image854.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"If you have faith God wants to establish it.

Especially England it’s described by William Blake that these times are going to come when England is going to become Jerusalem. <b>'Jerusalem’ means ‘where it will be pilgrimage.’</b> For people will think this is the Holy Land of God. That people will come to this Holy Land, to visit this place. So the people have to be holy, they have to. It’s not the trees that are going to become holy, it is not the land that is going to be holy but it’s the people. Their hearts are going to be holy.<br /> Then how do they become holy? What happen to a person when he really becomes holy? We talk of saints. We talk of prophets. What is the difference between these revered people and ordinary people? There’s only one difference. The difference is this: that in their attention, in their central nervous system, there is the light of their Spirit. While for the other people, they live in ignorance without this light of the Spirit. The Spirit exists in every one of us. It is always there, present, all the time. It’s Omnipresent. It’s all the time present within us. But the problem is that we are not aware of it, that it is not shining in our attention, in our awareness."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1982-0730 Public Program, All that Is Vital Is Extremely Simple, Community and Leisure Centre, Caldene Avenue, Mytholmroyd, Yorkshire, UK</b></font></p><p style="color:DarkGreen; text-align:center;"> <b>And did those feet in ancient time<br /> Walk upon Englands mountains green:<br /> And was the holy Lamb of God,<br /> On Englands pleasant pastures seen!<br /> <br /> And did the Countenance Divine,<br /> Shine forth upon our clouded hills?<br /> And was Jerusalem builded here,<br /> Among these dark Satanic Mills?<br /> <br /> Bring me my Bow of burning gold:<br /> Bring me my arrows of desire:<br /> Bring me my Spear: O clouds unfold!<br /> Bring me my Chariot of fire!<br /> <br /> I will not cease from Mental Fight,<br /> Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand:<br /> Till we have built Jerusalem,<br /> In Englands green &amp; pleasant Land.</b><br /> <a href="https://youtu.be/ZaVqVTjV4po">video</a></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image855.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"I, of course, bless you, with all the qualities of Bhairava,<br /> as He is the greatest disciple of Mahākālī and<br /> He is the One who is running up and down, morning till evening every time,<br /> especially in the night He is working so very hard killing these horrible rākṣhasas, this,<br /> that, and achieving such results.<br /> We have to join Him, all of us, and work it out.<br /> May God bless you."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1990-0912 Śhrī Mahākālī Pūjā, Qualities of Mahākālī and You Have to be Collective (Purity Means Chastity and For the Saints the Main Thing Is Their Ascent), Centre Culturel Thierry Le Luron, Le Raincy (13 kms E of Paris), France</b></font></p><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkSlateBlue"><b>Auṃ Twameva sākṣhāt Śhrī Bhairava sākṣhāt Śhrī Ādi Śhakti Mātājī Śhrī Nirmalā Devī namo namaḥ</b></font><br /> <b>O Divine Mother, You are verily Śhrī Bhairava, Salutations to You!</b></p><font size="+2"><b>Suggested Talk:</b></font> <font size="+0"><b>1981-1128 Public Program, You Are the Spirit, Friends Meeting House, 120 Heath Street, Hampstead, London NW3 1DR, UK</b></font><p><a href="https://youtu.be/4CA-Jn3-52A"> video</a><br /></p><font size="+2"><b>Bhajans:</b></font><p> <font color="green"><b>21 Names of Śhrī Bhairava</b></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Gajānana Śhrī Gaṇarāyā</b></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Tujhya Vina</b></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Āratī and the Three Great Mantras</b></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>England! awake! awake! awake!</b></font><br /> Śhrī William Blake<br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"Today is a very, important day. Because, long time back, when Christ was just a child, He read from the Scriptures, and declared to the multitudes, that He was the Advent – the Incarnation, who is the Savior. They believed that a Savior is going to come. Today, long time back, on a Sunday, He said, He declared that He was the Savior. That’s why today is the Advent Sunday. He had to live for a very very short time. So at a very young age He had to declare that He was the Advent. Now it is remarkable to see, that before this, no incarnation said publicly, that, they were incarnations. Rāma of course, had forgotten that He was an incarnation. In a way, He made Himself to forget, played His māyā upon Himself to become a complete human being – Maryādā Puruṣhottama and Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa also only told, one person Arjuna, just before he was to start the war. Abraham never said that He was the Incarnation, though He was the Incarnation of Primordial Master. Dattātreya Himself never said that He was the Incarnation of the Primordial Master. With all these three forces, acting through innocence, came on this Earth to guide, Moses never said that ... though they knew He was great, He had overpowered nature, but He never said that He was the Incarnation."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1979-1202 Guru Pūjā, The Declaration, Living Room, Āśhram, 8, Hamilton Road, Dollis Hill, London NW10 1NX, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image856.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>I declare I am the One who is Ādi Śhakti, who is the Mother of all the Mothers, who is the Primordial Mother, the Śhakti, the Desire of God, who has incarnated on this Earth to give Its meaning to Itself</b>, to this creation, to human beings, and I'm sure through My Love and Patience and My Powers, I am going to achieve it.<br /> <b>I was the One who was born again and again, but now in My Complete Form and Complete Powers,</b><br /> I have come on this Earth, not only for salvation of human beings, not only for their emancipation, but for granting them, the Kingdom of Heaven, the Joy, the Bliss, that your Father wants to bestow upon you.<br /> These words are to be kept within the bounds of Sahaja Yogis only, for the time being."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1979-1202 Guru Pūjā, The Declaration, Living Room, Āśhram, 8, Hamilton Road, Dollis Hill, London NW10 1NX, UK</b></font><br /> <br /> <font size="+0"><font color="DarkGreen"><b>Bolo Ādi Śhakti</b></font></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font size="+0">Jai Śhrī Mātājī!<br /> On behalf of the festivity team!</font></p></section><footer class="page__meta"></footer><nav class="pagination"> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/festivity/2021/11/19" class="pagination--pager" title="2021 Celebrating Śhrī Guru Nāṇaka Jayanti: “You are the seekers: you are the Men of God.
