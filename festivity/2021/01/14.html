In India, all the festivals are according to the position of the Moon. That’s why their dates are different in different years. Makar Saṅkrānti is based on the position of the Sun and that is the reason this festival is celebrated every year on fourteenth January.<br /> Makar Saṅkrānti indicates the day when the Sun becomes warmer. The heat of the Sun is benevolent for the human race. It is because of this heat that we can walk, we can talk. The heat of the Sun makes a human being angry. This is the reason why we take jaggery on this day so that we talk sweetly. The heat of the Sun is responsible for all the vegetation and wealth of the Earth. On this day we offer fruits and vegetables to the Devī and receive Her blessings. With the blessings of Ādi Śhakti the earth element cools down and the human race progresses."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>2002-0114 Makar Saṅkrānti Pūjā (Marathi), Gain Self-confidence from the Light of the Sun and Become Radiant, House of Kalpana Shrivastava, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image611.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="Sienna"><b>"Saṅkrānti means Power of the Sun.

Revolution. Holy revolution.</b> Holy. And that’s what I’m telling them, what is the Holy Revolution is, that your own dharma is established now through Sahaja Yoga. You know what is your dharma. Because if you don’t do your own dharmas you’ll be lost. Your vibrations will be lost. You’ll immediately know that in your seeking you have lost something. You’ll be affected and so you have to correct. That’s not so difficult.<br /> But to make it a Saṅkrānta – Holy Revolution – you have to take to new ... new religion, new steps. First of all, your own step should be enlightened, and then you must establish new steps to go ahead. ......<br /> Today is the day they give you a sweet thing to say that you must speak sweetly which is very important for Western people that when you are doing and organizing you become heated up, there’s tension and you develop a temperament which is dry, emotionless. You know the heart goes into a tantrum. At that time they say that you take the sweet.<br /> This sweet is a heated thing because now the Sun is moving towards the other side. That time also they, to give it a balance, they say: “Speak very sweetly. Use sweet words, use sweetness. Bring sweetness in your language.” Which is very important, you understand that.<br /> And this is one of the religions we have to accept that we will not use harsh words to each other and then later on to others. First of all to each other."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1981-0114 Makar Saṅkrānti Pūjā (Marathi+English), Ahitagni Rajwade Maṅgal Karyalaya, 840 Sadashiv Peth, Pune, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image612.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="Sienna"><b>"Today is the day to make joy and to enjoy everything and to feel the blessings of God all around us.

Therefore, hope you will spread Sahaja Yoga. It is very important because you know My vision is too big and you have to really work hard to fulfill My vision.</b> And to give Realization to people as many as possible. You have to think what is your mind doing. There are many people who are waiting to come in Sahaja Yoga. You should have the light of spirituality: you have to feel that you are spiritual, you have to grow it, and also make others grow. ......<br /> The Sun changes its direction, everybody knows about it, everybody prays for it.<br /> People take bath in the River Ganges for purification. This is all right.<br /> <b>Now it is a time for purification, identification and also of understanding the importance of Sahaja Yoga.</b> I don’t know how many people really understand the importance of Sahaja Yoga. If that is understood, one can do a lot of work in Sahaja Yoga. It is such a noble work, which you all have to do it collectively.<br /> And then you feel your life has a meaning, otherwise, there is no meaning and no light in your life. So you have to work out in that manner which gives inspiration to others."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>2001-0114 Makar Saṅkrānti Pūjā (English+Marathi), You Have to Change, Pratiṣhṭhān, NDA Road, Pune, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>Warmth of the Sun represents the warmth of God’s Love.</b> This is the reason why we celebrate this festival by giving you some sort of a sweet made out of sesame seeds. Sesame seeds are given because they are also heat-giving and now as we are coming from the cold, we come to the hot season in a way, hotter season, so to prepare you with that warmth of the Sun these special things are made out of the seed of sesame to represent the oncoming warmth and the warm of the Sun.<br /> Though in India the heat is too much, still people are waiting for this time to come in and they celebrate it with such a warm heart. At this time it is said that they give you this sesame seed and the sugar to eat, but now you must speak in a sweet manner, <b>“gūḷ gūḷ bola” means you must speak in the sweet manner</b>.<br /> Speaking in the sweet manner is very important. Some people think it is smart to speak in a rude manner or is very intelligent to shout on people, but no one likes this kind of a personality.<br /> <b>To speak in a very sweet manner is a sign of good breeding, good culture and fear of God. Those who fear God will never speak rudely to another person, because in another person also the same Spirit is shining and why should we be sharp or angry with another person who is created by God Almighty as we are created.</b><br /> So this loving, beautiful relationship that we have with each other, after Sahaja Yoga especially, let us express in talking to each other sweetly. There are so many ways by which we could be sweet. There are little, little things if you do, you can create lot of sweetness, but you need not a sharp tongue, but a sharp memory."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1987-0114 Makar Saṅkrānti Pūjā (English+Marathi), Carry the Sun with You, House of Madhukar Dhumāḷ, Rāhurī, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image613.png" /></div><p style=" text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkOrange">"Now the Sun is so much respected in this country, that in early morning time all the people get up and say namas-kārs to Sūrya with all His names and do a particular type of exercise to show that they are completely surrendered to the will of the Sūrya."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1985-0114 Makar Saṅkrānti Pūjā (English+Marathi), We Are Going to Make Peace with Ourselves and with Others (We Will Take to Peaceful Methods), Suryavanshi Hall (near Śhivajī Park), Dadar, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India</b></font><br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqmPOEnU9tg&amp;ab_channel=NoeSahajaItalia">video</a></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"Today the Sun left its place and, in its northward movement, came towards us.
