This is the Path of Compassion and Love</b>.<br /> Through that compassion and love She creates this Path because She knows that if the Path is not wide enough the Kuṇḍalinī cannot rise. Ultimately, one reaches a state where you start seeking and when you start seeking, your Mahālakṣhmī Principle has been awakened. That is awakened and sometimes it is very strong. Then you start seeking in a mad way. I am sorry to say that many are already lost in seeking, but there are so many who have now come to the right path and to the right ascent.<br /> Another thing this Mahālakṣhmī Principle does is to allow the Kuṇḍalinī’s Power to go to different chakras also. To make a way to different chakras and corrects all the chakras. She is a very flexible force, I should say, which guides the Kuṇḍalinī into different chakras and She understands which chakra needs the help of the Kuṇḍalinī. So you must have seen that when the Kuṇḍalinī rises how She pulsates, where She goes, where She shows the need is of your awakening.<br /> All this works out because She is full of compassion and love that you should get your Absolute Truth."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1996-1110 Diwālī Pūjā (Diwālī Day), What State You Have to Reach, Quinta do Mar, Sintra (29 kms NW of Lisbon), Portugal</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is the ninth day of Navarātri.</b> The Devī incarnated on this Earth to kill the demonic personalities who try to destroy all the good qualities of women.
