But still, still we have to come up, and work out in our own lives the priorities that we have. For the Gods the priorities were only divine work, nothing else. Nobody took up a job, nobody. Nobody went to university, nobody studied. Only thing they did was the work of God.<br /> So you do everything else as work of God, and that’s how the energy will flow into you. When you start doing the work of God, everything you do becomes work of God; in the sense that you do the work of God, you decide, ‘I’m going to do the work of God,’ then God takes over.
