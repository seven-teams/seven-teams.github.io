Till today many Saints have written and spoken a lot about the Śhakti. Those who could not explain the Śhakti in their texts they did it in their poems.<br /> Additionally, they learnt different meanings of the Śhakti. But one thing probably we may not know is that inside every human beings these powers are present in a dormant state and all these powers human being can awaken within himself. All these powers which are present in the dormant state are endless, nor anybody can guess their limit because as an example there are 35 crores [350 million] Deities seated within you. Apart from that, there are several powers that are running them, but at least we can understand that the Self-realization that we received today, certainly some Śhaktis must have worked this out. Without this work, you cannot get your Self-realization. When we are receiving our Self-realization we think that we got it very easily."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1990-1009 Śhrī Devī Pūjā (Hindi), New Delhi, India</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"This Power of Love is the Greatest Power and after Sahaja Yoga we have to use only our Power of Love.

And if we are connected with God Almighty, who could be mightier than us?

Today is the 7th day of the Goddess. On the 7th day, the Devī Goddess destroyed the various rākṣhasas and sinners, because they were torturing the great Saints and Ṛiṣhis who were doing meditation and penance.<br /> We wonder, “Mother, why they did so much penance? What was the need?” The reason for doing it was because although human ascent was still low, yet their aspiration was very high. They aspired to achieve the Ātmā through the body. That is why they worked so hard and did penance in this place. It is due to their aspiration that today we are able to achieve this height. This does not mean that we should think that because of the blessing of Sahaja Yoga we are some great people or some specially chosen people by God. People who think like that will receive a great shock. You will see that those who are simple, innocent, and good-natured will ascend foremost and the rest will be left behind. Therefore just receiving your Realization is not the end.<br /> <b>On this auspicious occasion, God Almighty has manifested all His śhaktis for your protection, benevolence, and welfare. In everything, God is blessing you. He wants to see you enter His Kingdom.</b> In a way, it is His Desire that you should return to your Father’s home and enjoy its comforts. But at least we should be worthy of it. If we are not worthy of it then how can we enter it?
