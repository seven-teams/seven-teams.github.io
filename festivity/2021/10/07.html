In your childlike nature only, <b>you can receive the blessings of Gaurī, otherwise, you cannot.</b> You have to be really childlike, otherwise, it is absolutely useless, no use telling you anything because you think you’re too clever. To such a person, who thinks he is too clever, what’s the use of talking to such a person, because he already knows everything.<br /> So the first power when you develop, you must learn to sit on the Mother Earth, first of all. You must respect the Mother Earth, because the first chakra is made out of the Mother Earth. Try to be more settled down with yourself on Mother Earth. And the respect. See the trees when they get their flowers, they are not so respectful, but when they are laden by the fruits, they bow down to Mother Earth. In the same way, when you have got the fruits of Sahaja Yoga, you all must bow down.<br /> And innocence has a special capacity to make a person extremely peaceful, extremely peaceful. All the anger, temper, violence. If a person doesn’t have innocence, it cannot come in it, because a person who is not innocent is either sly or aggressive. He cannot have peace within his heart.
