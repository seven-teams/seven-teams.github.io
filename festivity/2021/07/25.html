And so, when you are worshiping your Guru, then this Master within you is also worshiped, you respect it, you glorify it, you awaken it, and you manifest it. This we have to realize that – in Sahaja Yoga – if you are a Sahaja Yogi.<br /> Now, the quality of guru, first and foremost, is that he makes you meet God: means he raises the Kuṇḍalinī and establish the relation between the All-pervading Power. And as your Guru is Ādi Śhakti, you make that person meet, also, the Ādi Śhakti. So you have a double advantage that, at the same time, when you give them Realization, not only that you make them feel the Union with the Divine Power, but you can make them meet the Divinity Itself, the Source of Divine Power. So your responsibility, as Sahaja Yogis, is very great because in you is there is the Guru."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1990-0708 Guru Pūjā, Silence Has to Be Established and Have Faith Completely in Yourself and in the All-pervading Power, Camp Site, Island in the NW side of Avignon, France</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image737.png" /></div><p style="color:DarkRed; text-align:center;"> Guru hamari Ādiśhakti, Karale he man. in.ki bhakti, In. ke hi guna gaye oh ...<br /> <font size="+0"><b>My Guru is the Ādi Śhakti, O my heart, please do Her Bhakti, Please sing Her praises only ...</b></font><br /> He man Guru Sharan. me rahio, rahio , He man Ma ki Sharan.

Try to find out the character of your Guru. Rather difficult, because your Guru is very elusive. She’s Mahāmāyā: not easy to find out. She behaves in a very normal way, and sometimes you are outwitted. But you see how, in small things also, how She behaves, how Her character is expressed, how Her love is expressed, try to remember all that, Her forgiveness.<br /> And then you should know that you have the Guru which many people must have desired to have, which is the Source of all the Gurus. It is the ardent desire of even Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, Maheśha to have a Guru like that, and They must be all jealous of you.<br /> But this Guru is very elusive. So to improve your Void, say that, ‘Mother, You are our Guru.’ Because of this elusiveness, that fear or that awe which is necessary, that respect which is necessary for the Guru, is not established. Unless and until you develop that awe, complete awe within you, your Guru Principle won’t develop. No liberty is to be taken. I’m telling you Myself, but I am extremely elusive. Next moment I’ll make you laugh and forget about it, because I’m testing your freedom to do it, complete freedom. I’ll play with you in such a manner that you’ll be forgetting every moment that I’m your Guru, every moment.<br /> <b>So first of all you must find out about your own Guru, establish Her in your heart.</b>"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1980-0727 Guru Pūjā (Guru Pūrṇimā Day), Statutes of the Lord (You Do Not Harm Anyone, The Testimony of the Truth, Develop Detachment, Lead a Moral Life) and Promise that You Will Be a Guru Worthy of Your Mother (Today I Authorize You to Be the Gurus and You Have a Very Supreme Guru), Temple of All Faiths, Hampstead, London, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image738.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Aneka janam sampraptam<br /> Sarva karma vidahine<br /> svatmaj nana prabhavena<br /> tasmai Śhrī Guruve namah</b><br /> <font size="+0">I bow to the Honored Guru<br /> who awakens Kuṇḍalinī<br /> and burns up all the karmas from<br /> all the actions in countless lives.</font><br /> <b>Na Guroradhikam tattwam<br /> na Guroradhikam tapah<br /> tatwam jnanatparam nasti<br /> tasmai Śhrī Guruve namah</b><br /> <font size="+0">There is no truth higher than Her,<br /> no austerity greater than<br /> serving Her, no higher knowledge<br /> than my bowing to the Guru.</font></font><br /> <font size="+0">(Verses 73-74, Guru Gītā by Sage Vyāsa)</font><br /> <font color="blue"><font size="+0">Guru Ashtakam 1993-0704 Guru Pūjā, Cabella</font></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"So, for a Sahaja Yogi, is important that he should have joy, within his heart. It’s like an ocean. It’s like an ocean which is there, all the time, to give you such thrills. Even little drops of this ocean, when they trickle down in your being, it is so soothing. The experience can be only experienced. But’s [but it’s] all waiting within yourself. And such a person also makes others joyous. He cannot see another person unhappy, in trouble. Himself is full of joy and spreads joy all around.<br /> You can get joy from small, small things, because you have the ocean and a little thing that drops into the ocean creates such beautiful ripples: they touch the shores, not only of your own being, but of others.<br /> Very, very small things make you so very happy. And that, all the time, you are just like a surfing, as they call it these days, on this beautiful lake or a beautiful Ocean of Love. Love is joy-giving. Is not carnal love, it is Divine Love.<br /> So, as Sahaja Yogis and as gurus, we have to love ourselves and understand our own value. I think Sahaja Yogis have not yet understood their value: ‘How many people in this world can give Realization? How many know about Kuṇḍalinī? How many have seen people being resurrected all the time?’ You are made so powerful that even looking at people, you can give Realization."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1993-0704 Guru Pūjā, Understand Our Own Value, Tent, Cabella Ligure, Alessandria, Italy</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image739.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>RACHA PRABHU TUNEY YAHA BRAHMANDA SARA</b></font><br /> O God You have created the whole universe<br /> <font color="DarkRed"><b>PRANON SEY PYARA, BRAHMANDA SARA</b></font><br /> The whole universe is dearer than our lives<br /> <font color="DarkRed"><b>TUHI MAI BANDHU, TUHI JAGAT JANANI</b></font><br /> You are my Mother and brother, You are the Mother of the universe<br /> <font color="DarkRed"><b>SAKAL JAGAT MEIN YAH TERA PASARA</b></font><br /> The whole universe is but your form<br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="DarkGreen">"So, the technique of Sahaja Yoga is like this: is not anger, is not repulsion, is not hatred, but the technique is such by which you suggest your love. This is how one has to understand the difference between a Sahaja Yogi guru and other gurus. No question of beating your disciple, no question of scol... scolding, no question of shouting at them. Love is the most powerful thing! Of course it doesn’t work on some people, I agree. Forget them. But [it] works in most of the people because God has made us out of His Love, and we have a capacity to yield to that Love and to enjoy that Love.<br /> So, for a Sahaja Yogi, what he has to do is to understand the powers of love. Powers of love, if you can understand, it will grow within you. Some people have, some people don’t have.&gt;br&gt; <b>Try to understand: this Paramachaitanya is nothing but is [the] Power of God’s Love, or you can say Mother’s Love.

These are like the seeds within us of love, which sprouted. Slowly and gradually we started the showers of blessings of love.
