It is a Full Moon Day, that’s why it’s called as Pūrṇimā. The guru has to be like a Full Moon, means completely grown, completely matured.</b><br /> ...... Now we have to understand the importance of guru. Why should we have a guru when we have God? We’ve got Śhakti, then why should we have a guru? What is the need to have a guru? Guru means ‘the weight’, the weight. We get our weight from the magnetic forces of the gravity of the Mother Earth. So guru means gravity, a gravity in a person. Why do we need a guru? Because to know God is easy, specially in Sahaja Yoga, to be one with Him. As soon as you get your Self-realization in Sahaja Yoga, the modern Sahaja Yoga, immediately you become entitled to give Realizations to other. It was said that guru is the person who makes you meet the Divine. That’s not true, because any self-realized person in the Sahaja Yoga can raise the Kuṇḍalinī and can give Self-realization to others, immediately after they have touched the Sahasrāra or opened the Sahasrāra. But normally a realized Soul cannot do it. Any born realized Soul cannot do it on its own, it has to have authority of Me as I am today.<br /> That’s why <b>it was said that guru is a person who makes you meet God; he raises the Kuṇḍalinī and makes you one with God.</b> Because in those days when the gurus were self-realized when the gurus were realized, they had the authority and power of raising the Kuṇḍalinī only after they had reached a very great state of evolution – complete purification, complete detachment."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1979-0708 Guru Pūjā, Āśhram, 8, Hamilton Road, Dollis Hill, London NW10 1NX, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image730.png" /></div><p style="color:DarkRed; text-align:center;"> <b>Guru Charnan. ki lagi lagan. hai</b><br /> Now we have got the Divine attachment to the Lotus Feet of our Guru<br /> <b>Tav.

Because as God has created days of [unclear], human beings have created days of their surrendering.<br /> So this is the day when you have to give something to the Guru. And Guru does not have to give anything to you. This is the time you have to say what you are going to give, what you are going to do for your Guru. Because so far the Guru has been giving. If you are in meditation supposing you say we’ll meditate because Guru Pūrṇimā is there. That’s not the way the Guru Pūrṇimā is to be celebrated, because if you meditate you are taking from Me. If you try to correct yourself you are taking from Me. If you are going to get cured you are taking from Me. So now what can you do for Me? Is the point you have to think about. What can you do? Now I have sent the same question to India, [unclear] I asked them to find out what can you do for Me. You will say: ‘Mother, what can we do? After all, what are we?’ That’s a way of evading the issue. But if you really want to see, you can do a lot and that is what it is that you are My witness. You are My publicity. So today you have to take some vows. And you have to say that we are going to do these things. We are going to talk about Sahaja Yoga, we are going to propagate it, we are going to spread it and what may come we are going to surrender ourselves to Mother even if She’s, supposing, scolds us, or says anything it is for our own good and we are not going to get confused. And that’s how you have to absolutely vow that you are going to dedicate yourself to Sahaja Yoga to help others, to emancipate and to create atmosphere for the completion of this universe, of this creation for that [unclear full, full] day when you will say that the Kingdom of God has been brought on this earth.

But this nourishment has to be retained within ourselves, so always remember then, whenever you are worshiping any principle outside, you are trying to worship your own principle within yourself.<br /> Within us, as you know, in all of us there lies the Principle of Guru. Is very interesting to notice the Guru Principle being drawn beautifully round the Nābhī chakra. We never see any chakras connected with the Guru Principle. You see Nābhī, and around is the Bhavasāgara. So this Bhavasāgara which is the Ocean of Illusion cannot be the Guru.
