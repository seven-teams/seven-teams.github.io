On the contrary, they have gone into a kind of a cocoon which has no door, banging themselves against the walls, creating problems out of something very auspicious and extremely, beautifully spiritual.<br /> Is not possible to find faults with the Incarnations in whose names all the religions came in. But this cocoon is the Mahāmāyā, I think, cocoon is the one which is ignorance. We can say that Māyā ... Mahāmāyā does not create it.

Thus we understand that in the second era, now, we have to have compassion. Is the manifestation now of the compassion.<br /> If God Almighty had no compassion, He would not have created this great Universe. Actually, His Power, or the Ādi Śhakti, is the Embodiment of His Compassion. And this compassion has brought forth all the evolution to human level, and even your emancipation as Sahaja Yogis.<br /> And compassion is always completely covered with forgiveness.<br /> <b>So you can see, the Trinity meets at this point.

Every one of you have got it. Also all over the world, you have many people who have got their Sahasrāras open.

They have understood Sahaja Yoga very well, and they have developed their depth, and their consciousness is really a great awareness of Oneness with the Divine.<br /> To be one with the Divine is the greatest blessing for human beings. So far, they were human beings at a lower level of existence. They had all the problems of that level – is that jealousies, hatred; all kinds of problems that are today, of fighting, of troubling others, destroying others and not loving others. All these problems existed because their Sahasrāra was not opened.<br /> ...... in Sahaja Yoga so many people have come whose Sahasrāra was completely opened and they felt their depth. Firstly you must feel your depth. If you don’t feel your depth, and you are not one with your personality which is so deep, then you cannot enjoy the Self-realization.<br /> First of all, you should understand yourself. If you don’t understand yourself, how can you understand other people. You cannot. So first this Sahasrāra should be opened out fully. Fully means complete Oneness with the Divine. That is not difficult. Only you have to meditate a little bit and then it will work out. It has worked out in many people I am very happy to see, and meet such people in Sahaja Yoga, who have achieved such a lot of collectivity and also the awareness of a realized Soul."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>2002-0505 Sahasrāra Pūjā, Watch Yourself, Hangar (now Nirmal Temple), Albera Ligure, Alessandria, Italy</b></font></p><p style="text-align:center;"> <b>Sahaja Yogi</b>: <font color="DarkRed"><b>Salutations to the Queen of Sahasrāra, salutations to the Queen of the Seven Peaks.<br /> Today, on this great, great day, we see the Universe at Your Feet.<br /> Nothing ever had a meaning nor a life, everyone so dry and so weak, then You came,<br /> O Mother, so caring, so sweet.<br /> You taught Your children even to walk and to speak.<br /> We thank You, O Mother, for bringing us up, opening the doors of Heaven for all of us.<br /> Salutations to the Queen of Sahasrāra, salutations to the Queen of the Seven Peaks.<br /> Today, on this great, great day, we see the Universe at Your Feet.<br /> We were the clay but You all the Supreme Creator <br /> ......<br /> Salutations to the Queen of Sahasrāra, salutations again and again to the Queen of the Seven Peaks.<br /> Today, on this great, great day, we see the Universe at Your Feet.</b></font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1994-0508 Sahasrāra Pūjā, Mahāmāyā Swarūpa, Tent, Cabella Ligure, Alessandria, Italy</b></font><br /> <font color="DarkGreen"><font size="+0"><b>O Queen of universe&lt;/&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;<br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y2Z3tNAs0I&amp;ab_channel=SahajaYogafamilymeditation">video</a> &lt;/p&gt;<div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image703.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Prana-tanam prasida twam</b></font><br /> O Devī, the remover of the afflictions of the universe,<br /> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Devī Vishw'arti-harni</b></font><br /> e pleased with us who are prostrating at Your Lotus Feet.<br /> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Trailokya vasinam'idye</b></font><br /> O Devī, who is worshipped by the dwellers of the three worlds,<br /> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Lokanam varda bhava</b></font><br /> Please grant boons to all the people.<br /> <br /> <font size="+0"><b>Sahaja Yogi</b>: <b>``Ātā Viśhwātmakeṃ deveṃ yeṇe vāgyajñeṃ toṣhāveṃ.
