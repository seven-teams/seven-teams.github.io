And one day He was shocked to see a very poor man, thin man, walking on the street, very unhappy person, and He felt very sad about it. Then He saw one person who was very sick and about to die. Then He saw a man who was dead and people were carrying him to the cremation ground. This all upset Him very much and He started thinking about it and seeking what is the reason for all these happenings in human beings. Firstly, why do they become so miserable or sick, or, why do they die so miserably? The reason He found out in His search. He went round the whole world, I should say, in the sense: He read Upaniṣhads, He read ... went to many gurus, went to many places of spiritual education, Benares, everywhere He went. And ultimately, He was sitting under a banyan tree when suddenly His Kuṇḍalinī was awakened by Ādi Śhakti and He got His Realization. Then He realized that the reason for all this is the desire. <b>In Sahaja Yoga, we have now understood that all other desires are not pure desires. Firstly, whatever desires are fulfilled, we are not satisfied by it, first thing. And secondly, all these desires have a repercussion.</b> So what is the pure desire? That, you all know, is the Kuṇḍalinī. <b>Kuṇḍalinī is the power of pure desire, which fulfills your pure desire to be the Spirit, to be Buddha, to be enlightened. Buddha means a person who is enlightened.</b>"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1991-0804 Śhrī Buddha Pūjā, You Must Become Desireless, Brielpoort Sports Hall, Deinze, Belgium</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image710.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"The Pūjā to Shrī Buddha is being performed<br /> today to open this chakra.<br /> At the level of the Āgñyā chakra there are thoughts.

In the whole map of time, Buddha came to this Earth at a time when it was so important for Him to come. That time, especially in India, we had two types of people: one, who were very ritualistic, trying to be extremely strict and disciplined; and the another were the people who were too much conditioned and were full of so-called devotion to God. So these two types of people were occupying the area of seekers. So it was necessary to neutralize these two styles of seekings."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1988-0723 Śhrī Buddha Pūjā, Tent, YMCA Camp Surf, 560 Silver Strand Blvd, Imperial Beach (21 kms S of San Diego), CA, U.S.A.</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image711.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>“And ultimately, He was sitting under a banyan tree when suddenly His Kuṇḍalinī was awakened by Ādi Śhakti and He got His Realization.

So He had to take saṃnyāsa because without that He could not show that. But there was no need for anybody else to take saṃnyāsa. But in His case mistakes, I mean, why there were some mistakes about things, because when He tried all these tricks of saṃnyāsa, going here and there He never realized that this is all not needed.<br /> He was so tired and fagged out, that suddenly, spontaneous, the Primordial Mother Herself gave Him the Realization because He was so tired."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1979-0611 Public Program, How Aspects of God Are Expressed within Us, Caxton Hall, 10 Caxton Street, Westminster, London, UK</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"Today’s Pūjā is very important because I feel Western countries have gone off with their ego, and they need Buddha very much, and they like also this so-called Buddhism very much, because you see, they can then just hide behind that camouflage. “We are Buddhist, you see.” They’ll worry about Afghanistan and they’ll worry about lama. They’ll worry about all other people, because, “You see, we are Buddhist.” But there’s no truth in it, no truth.<br /> Sahaja Yogis have to establish that truth, that dedication.<br /> So Buddha has said: “Buddham śharaṇaṃ gacchāmi.” “I bow to all those who are realized Souls.” “Dhammam śharaṇaṃ gacchāmi.” “I bow myself, to my dharma,” that is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma. And then lastly is: “Saṅghaṃ śharaṇaṃ gacchāmi.” “I bow to collectivity.” "</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1989-0520 Śhrī Buddha Pūjā, Gautama, The Lord of the Ego, Open Air near El Farell Hotel, Barcelona, Spain</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>When you say, “Mother, we surrender to You,” that just means that you give that horrible ego a complete holiday</b>, it means that.
