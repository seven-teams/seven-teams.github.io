So now here we are celebrating actually the Deity which is the Sister of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.

Viśhuddhi on the right side can create collectivity, can create understanding with each other but on the left side, it helps you to keep a complete integration between your heart and your head.<br /> If there is a guilt you just think of it and analyze it. It means that there’s a struggle between you in your heart and your mind, isn’t it? Simple as that. If it was integrated you would not feel guilty.

Sisters and brothers should never feel guilty about themselves and they should always openly tell whatever they think wrong or whatever they think is right. <b>There is no harm, a sister can always go and correct the brother, and a brother can always come and correct the sister. This is the relationship in which nobody should feel hurt and bad, because this is the purest relationship that you could think of.</b> As mother, if she tells something, the difference of age is so much that you may not understand. Maybe if the father says something the children may not understand, the difference of age is too much and also the norms that we have created of saying that there's a generation gap and all this nonsense that is also in the head. But supposing a brother and sister, if they, between themselves, understand Sahaja Yoga, they have every right to say whatever is wrong between them and work it out -- not to put it as a guilt.<br /> <b>But now with rākhī sister is even better. Now with rākhī sister we have established a beautiful atmosphere that somebody who is a brother, you cannot have any funny relationships with that person.</b> It kills all your flirtations, all your funny, funny relationships that one develops, all kinds of marriage breaking problems, and people going astray, once you have understood the principle that we have to first settle ourselves on very holy relationship with each other."<br /> <b>This is the way, in Sahaja Yoga, we establish that holy relationship.</b> And moreover, one has to see that this holy relationship gives you joy, happiness, and pleasure. It is not just a holy relationship of some force or some sort of a thing. Even if you cannot give anything to your sister, or the brother cannot do anything for the sister, doesn't matter. The relationship is in the heart, and is felt very much and when you feel it, that relationship, that sweetness of purity, of holiness, flows. I know of some people who have sacrificed such a lot for the brothers and so much for the sisters.<br /> So one has to understand this relationship is to be kept very clean, beautiful, and absolutely open -- there should be no formality in it. That a brother should go and say, 'I'm sorry,' and the sister should go and say, 'I'm sorry.' You have to be open and tell -- you should never feel bad about your brother or sister.</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1988-0820 Śhrī Viṣhṇumāyā Pūjā (1 week before Rakṣhābandhan Day), Cure that Left Viśhuddhi, Śhuddhi Camp (now The Hall, Shudy Camps Park), Shudy Camps, Cambridgeshire, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image752.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>"Rākhī is Protecting Power.</b> Its bond is very strong and extremely tender because it symbolizes the noble love of sister.
