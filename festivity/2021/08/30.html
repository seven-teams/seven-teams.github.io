And here we have the flowing of water, both the sides. The way He used to play His flute, along with Jamunā River. The whole thing looks, sometimes, so human, but it is not. And, at the right time, whenever He needed, as a child, He manifested His Powers: that He killed a woman who was a devil [Pūtanā]; ultimately He killed Kaṃsa.</b><br /> After that, we know that He preached Gītā, but it’s not so fast as that. After killing Kaṃsa, He went down to Dvārakā to rule there. And there he had to marry five more wives. First, he had sixteen thousand wives. So many people can ask a question, “Mother, what sort of a husband He must be?”<br /> These sixteen thousand should explain that he has sixteen petals on his domain of Viśhuddhi chakra and these sixteen petals, multiplied by the one thousand petals of the Sahasrāra become sixteen thousand. So these are Sixteen Thousand Powers, which are available to us also.<br /> These Sixteen Thousand Powers are working in the brain. These powers could not come as Sahaja Yogis, so they came as women who were entrapped by a king – exactly sixteen thousand – and He married them because by marriage, it was all very dhārmik. Also, He married five wives later, who represented the five elements.<br /> Incarnation cannot be understood from human angle – can never be understood, I should say – because their ways and methods are different. They have ways and methods of their own and they do not expose them to other people. Not that they are afraid to expose or they don’t want to expose, but it will not be intelligible, it cannot be understood by human beings."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1987-0816 Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa Pūjā, The Sixteen Thousand Powers of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines (11 kms SW of Versailles), France</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image761.png" /></div><p style="color:blue; text-align:center;"> <b>Veda Houn.

We should look towards ourselves, within ourselves and that is not such a difficult thing.</b>"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>2003-0810 Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa Pūjā (Hindi), Pune, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image762.png" /></div><p style="color:blue; text-align:center;"> <b>You grant the power of auspicious vision.<br /> You grant the power of leadership.<br /> You granted abundance to America.<br /> You grant then power of plenitude<br /> You grant the power to communicate and convince.</b></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"Now just to say that you go within yourself, meditate, take out these things from within, is very easy. But that will not do. That is why we have to meditate and constantly work towards it. And we have ways that we know. Like to meditate on Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. <b>By meditating on Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa we get cleansed from within. But when we meditate on Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa we think about the defects of others.</b> If we want to look at the defects of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa we can see that also, but we cannot see our own defects. This is too much that we cannot see our own defects but are able to see the defects of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa.<br /> ......<br /> <b>I do not believe that there is a greater Yogi than Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa, because he showed us the way to look at the mistakes within ourselves, the defects within ourselves.</b> This is a very big thing. He said it, but people who actually do it are very less in number. Mostly we look at the defects of others because everyone remembers them, everyone knows them. But very few people are able to understand their own defects.<br /> That is why those people will never be all right. We have to be familiar with our own defects and laugh at ourselves and think that “Look at me, what kind of defects I am having within myself.” We should think about this.<br /> This attention is never on the Self but on the defects of others. This causes us to be unsettled and we fail to understand that these are our own defects.<br /> <b>The message of today’s festival is that we should look within ourselves and see. This is what Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa has said. But people find this hard to do. It doesn’t happen. What is the reason that we are not able to see ourselves? What is this veil in between? The veil is of bad things like ego, etc. They stand up and we are unable to see the defects that we should see.</b> To see these defects is very essential.<br /> I am very happy that you kept today’s Pūjā. Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa’s Pūjā will take place and a lot of people will get cleansed from within because this is a special blessing of Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. He will do it Himself, but you have to show a little interest, an inclination that you want to be completely cleansed from within. You don’t know how profound this question is.
