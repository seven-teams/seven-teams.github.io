In these modern times, people have lost the sense of auspiciousness. Everything that emits vibrations, ‘Chaitanya’, is auspicious, is śhubh, and whatever does not, is not, by any chance, auspicious.

Joy-giving quality comes from Śhrī Gaṇeśha. Even after coming to Sahaja Yoga, I’ve seen people are not full of joy. Are very serious, they don’t know how to laugh, how to enjoy anything. That’s the sign that they are still lacking in innocence. So it’s important to understand that, if you are Sahaja Yogis, you should be joyous and give joy to others, just like children, how sweet they are. They may be newly born, but how much joy they give you. But supposing you do not have that capacity to enjoy the innocence of children, then nobody can help you. Gaṇeśha cannot help you. Because that’s the innate quality human beings have and if you don’t have that quality, no use having any other sense. Like some people like food, they like colors, they like all other things. But if you don’t have Śhrī Gaṇeśh you cannot purely enjoy anything.<br /> So it is only [with] Śhrī Gaṇeśha’s blessings that we really enjoy everything in its full measure."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>2002-0914 Śhrī Gaṇeśha Pūjā, Hangar (now Nirmal Temple), Albera Ligure, Alessandria, Italy</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image770.png" /></div><p style=" text-align:center;"> <b>Sahaja Yogis</b> [recite]: "Jay Gaṇeśha, Jay Gaṇeśha, Jay Gaṇeśha Pāhimām, Śhrī Gaṇeśha, Jay Gaṇeśha, Jaya Gaṇeśha Rakṣhamām."<br /> <font color="DarkRed"><b>Śhrī Mātājī</b></font>: <font color="DarkGreen">Now, what you are doing by saying these mantras, you are awakening the innocence within you; innocence is represented by Śhrī Gaṇeśh.<br /> As you know, later on, He incarnated as Lord Jesus Christ, but the innocence within us must be first of all invoked, because, before creating the universe, first of all, innocence was created, because innocence has the greatest protective power, the greatest destructive power and it is the most powerful.<br /> So, first, we are trying to invoke the innocence.<br /> <b>Now, My Feet here represent Gaṇeśha, and they are innocent, and so, we are trying to worship those so that, within you, Gaṇeśha should be invoked.</b><br /> Your innocence should be enlightened, all right?</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1980-1012 Śhrī Gaṇeśha Pūjā (4th Day of Navarātri), Winterthurerstraße, Zürich, Switzerland</b></font></p><font size="+2"><b>Suggested Talk:</b></font> <font size="+0"><b>1991-0915 Śhrī Gaṇeśha Pūjā, Śhrī Gaṇeśha and His Qualities, Tent, Cabella Ligure, Alessandria, Italy</b></font><p><a href="https://vimeo.com/25269987"> video</a><br /></p><font size="+2"><b>Bhajans:</b></font><p> <font color="green"><b>Śhrī Gaṇeśha Atharva Śhīrṣha</b></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Jay Jay Bolo Nirmal Gaṇeśha Kī</b></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Śhrī Gaṇeśha Kinaryala Lau</b></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Gajananah Śhrī Gaṇarāya</b></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Jay Jagadambe</b></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Śhrī Gaṇeśha Pancha Ratnam</b></font> (names of Śhrī Gaṇeśha)<br /> <a href="https://youtu.be/TxotrB3Gzo0">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Śhrī Gaṇeśha Jay Śhrī Gaṇeśha</b></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Sukhkarta dukhharta Śhrī Gaṇeśh Āratī</b></font><br /> <a href="https://youtu.be/HNv44APLhL8?list=PLAFCF759D6F2B2407">video</a><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image771.png" /></div></p><p style=" text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>"So today’s Pūjā is specially to be done with a prayer in your heart that:<br /> <i>'Shrī Gaṇesha, please be kind and merciful and forgiving that You manifest within ourselves.<br /> Let all these hypocritical things, all these conditionings and all these wrong ideas we have or all the wrong life we have had should just disappear like thin air, and let the beautiful moonlight of your soothing qualities of innocence be manifested through us.'</i><br /> Let us manifest these qualities.
