And it had to take place that way, it was all, in a way, destined.</b><br /> In My last lectures, I have told you how Christ was created first in the Heavens. In the ‘Devī Māhātmyam [Bhāgavatam]’, if you read that, He was created as Mahāviṣhṇu and is mentioned very clearly that first He was created as an egg. It is written in this book, which perhaps was written about fourteen thousand years back. It’s a book that predicts about Christ and that is why people, in the West specially, offer an egg to each other as a friend. So, first the existence came on this Earth as an egg, that was Christ, and part of it was kept in that stage and the rest of it was used by the Holy Ghost, by Mahālakṣhmī, to create Christ out of it.<br /> In that ancient book He was called as Mahāviṣhṇu: means the Greater Form of Viṣhṇu. But actually, Viṣhṇu is the Father and He is the Son created by the Holy Ghost.<br /> And when He was created, He cried for His Father, as He cried also on the cross once. And He cried for years. And then Christ, in Mahāviṣhṇu State, was blessed by His Father, who said that, “Your position will be placed higher than Mine and You will be the Ādhāra,” means the Support of the Universe. See, how from Mūlādhāra He becomes the Ādhāra. This was all done at the heavenly stage, Vaikuṇṭha Stage you can say.<br /> Then He was given birth by the Holy Ghost who was the Mother of Christ on this Earth, who was nobody else but was the Incarnation of Mahālakṣhmī, means She was Rādhā. Rā-dhā. Rā means energy, dhā means the one who sustains energy."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1982-0411 Easter Pūjā, How Christ Was Created, Resurrection of Christ, and Collective Resurrection (Mahāviṣhṇu State, Easter Is the Most Important Happening, You are a Collective Being and Collectivity Is the Nature of a Sahaja Yogi), Nirmala Palace Āśhram, 99 Nightingale Lane, Balham, London SW12 8LZ, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image657.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"So, it was a very sad time when He was crucified. <b>But when He got resurrected it was the most joyous, most auspicious and most beautiful time.<br /> The Resurrection of Christ is very symbolic for Sahaja Yoga.

There was no need for Christ to enter into any new awareness, He had to come down and again to show to this world that you are the eternal life, that you lead a life that is spiritual, which never perishes.<br /> You have to rise into that new realm which is the Realm of God Almighty, what you call the ‘Kingdom of God’. And He said it very clearly to Nicodemus that, “You have to be born-again,” and when he asked, “Am I to enter back into my mother’s womb to be born-again?” And He said it so clearly! It’s so clear. Those who don’t want to see can remain blind! But he said it very very clearly that, “No,” that is,“whatever is born of the flesh is the flesh, but whatever is born of the Spirit is the Spirit.” I mean nothing could be more clear than that, that it has to be born of the Spirit."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1984-0422 Easter Pūjā, The Way of Our Full Spiritual Growth and Sahaja Penance, Temple of All Faiths, Hampstead, London, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image658.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"On the Easter Day, we give people eggs to remind them that, ‘You are egg now and you have to become the bird.’ But I don’t think people know that,<br /> <b>because Resurrection is the message of Christ.
