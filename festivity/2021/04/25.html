It is very surprising that London which we understand as Heart has Saint George as its angel. That is! They accept Bhairavnāth so it’s correct. Because if Śhivjī resides in heart then having Bhairavnāth is important. There are so many things which if we read with understanding then they are all interconnected and how is their relation automatically established. In Sahaj Śhakti you get overwhelmed and you enjoy it and this makes Me happy. God has created this universe for you so you should enjoy it, what else do you want. In you, there are many powers and you use them and you have also shared it with others.
