Once it is in the month of Chaitra as it is today.</b> On this day Devī is worshiped as Śhailaputrī, means the daughter of Himalaya. Devī has many other names also but first of all She incarnated as Śhailaputrī in the cold of Himalayas. She incarnated and whatever She was to do. She started there.<br /> ..When Kuṇḍalinī rises and reaches the Heart chakra then it manifests and becomes more powerful and effective because Kuṇḍalinī is Jagadambā. In Sahaja Yoga, when Kuṇḍalinī is awakened it, settles in Heart chakra. It protects you and takes care of you nicely.<br /> No one could harm you at all if you keep the Mother in your heart. The power of the mother always protects the children. Whenever there is some danger, it is mentioned in medical terminology that the sternum bone starts shaking and antibodies that are present all around get alarmed. In Sahaja language, these antibodies are called gaṇas. They get ready to fight it out. She is the empress of these gaṇas. They follow her commands as there is no difference between Śhrī Gaṇeśha and Devī. Both are so identified.<br /> Gaṇeśha is Her Son and She is His Mother. In Sahaja Yoga, She protects all those who have awakened Śhrī Gaṇeśha in themselves. She protects them just like Her own children at every step. She supports them because She is the Mother and you are the Gaṇeśha. But the Gaṇeśha within you should be fully awakened and pure. If there is obstruction in this chakra, it should be removed."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>2000-0405 Guḍhī Pāḍavā Pūjā (Hindi), Noida Bhavan, New Delhi, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image662.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>"Today is the Day of Guḍhī Pāḍavā.

But Gaṇeśha has to be established before anything else. Though first Gaurī had to come, you can see that. Gaurī had to come first to establish Gaṇeśha. But Gaṇeśha is always put before even Gaurī. Before the Pūjana of the worship of the Gaṇeśha, nothing starts; because He’s the one who takes out all the obstacles, all the negativities, all the hurdles that are going to come up, all the attentions that are here and there. So that’s why we first worship Gaṇeśha, just to ask Him to protect us.<br /> But first, the Gaurī has to come, and that’s how the Gaurī is this nine days. She came on this Earth to fight the devils and demons, negativity, for people to transcend the Bhavasāgara, the Void, the Rāmāyaṇa, the illusion. When they were praying, when they were doing anything, people used to obstruct and then they troubled the bhaktas, the devotees of God – rākṣhasas.<br /> ...... But today is actually the Pūjā of the Gaurī, that is, the Kuṇḍalinī. So Śhrī Gaṇeśh we’ll do first of all, and then we’ll worship the Kuṇḍalinī, which is the Gaurī."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1981-0404 Śhrī Gaṇeśha Gaurī Pūjā, Āśhram, 10 Clarence Street, Burwood, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image663.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkGreen">"<b>"So this New Year’s Day is the first day of advent of Goddess</b> – the nine days there are.<br /> ......

That’s why they were earlier called as Sāt[a]vāhana but later it changed to Śhālivāhana. But the symbol of Śhālivāhana used to be guḍhī means a flag and above that a pitcher having a particular shape, which represented the Kuṇḍalinī. They were worshipers of Kuṇḍalinī and recognized it.<br /> That is the reason that they have made this thing like that and all those, who accept it, put up a ‘guḍhī’ in their houses. They [Śhālivāhans] wanted to welcome Kuṇḍalinī on this day and Kuṇḍalinī [in the form of pitcher] was exhibited specially on that day."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>2002-0413 Guḍhī Pāḍavā Pūjā (Hindi), Terrace Garden, Palam Vihar, Gurgaon, Haryana, India</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Today is a very great day, it’s a New Year.</b> Within two years from today, Satya Yuga is going to start.

And that’s why they put this date as the first date because the time started from this date, long time back. And that’s why this date is very important.<br /> And if you cross this date, then you are beyond time. You have to step onto this date and go beyond.<br /> You have to step on your dharma, onto your religion, and go beyond, dharmātīt. You have to be those three guṇas and to go beyond: guṇātīt. You are all those three. But the steps on which you are standing have to be all right, or those which are crossed or have to be all right, too. So when you are beyond, you have to repair those steps which you have crossed somehow.<br /> It can be done through meditation, Pūjā, prayers.<br /> But the most important, the greatest advancement is done by giving the Universal through your Universal Being. You all must dedicate your life to Sahaja Yoga and give more and more. Among us, there are some people who have given a lot, and by that, they have achieved a lot, too. You have to give, talk about it, spread it, and bring more people to get this.
