In the heart, to do Navarātri is to accept the Powers of the Śhakti, to realize the power that all these chakras have got in themselves, and that when they are enlightened how you can express all these powers of these Nine Chakras within ourselves; the seven chakras plus the heart and the Moon makes it nine. But I would say that seven of these and on top of that, we should say two more centers, which Blake has described surprisingly as nine centers, clearly. Just now I cannot talk of the higher two centers, but let us at least talk of the seven centers. The power of these centers, have we been able to develop within ourselves?"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1984-0923 Navarātri Pūjā (1st Day), The Discipline, Hampstead Town Hall Centre, 213 Haverstock Hill, London NW3 4QP, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image164.png" /></div><p style="color:green; text-align:center;"> <font color="MidNightBlue"><b>We should devote ourselves to that Devī<br /> Who resides at the center of our lotus hearts,<br /> Whose glory is like that of the rising sun,<br /> Whose face is pleasing,<br /> Who grants all boons and protection,<br /> Who is three-eyed, Who wears red clothes, and<br /> Who fulfills the desires of Her devotees.</b><br /> <font size="-1">(Śhrī Devī Atharva Sheersha)</font></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"Today is the first day of Navarātri.

Everyone has some specialty. What is Mother's specialty? Her ego (aham) is nowhere felt by others. Hence Śhrī Gaṇeśha who has surrendered to such Mother, is so wise and venerable, Mother has nothing with Her. Her very name begins with 'Ni', e.g., 'Niṣhakāñchan[ā]' having no wealth, 'Nirlepā' unaffected; 'Nirvichārā' thoughtless; 'Niṣhprayojanā' having no motives, 'Nigarvitā' egoless, 'Niricchā' desireless, etc. Therefore, surrendering to such Mother, who has nothing with Her, needs some kind of subtle thought, in that, Mother has nothing with Her and therefore, nothing can be asked from Her."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1978-1002 Letter to All Sahaja Yogis (Marathi) (1st Day of Navarātri), London, UK from Nirmala Yoga, Issue 11 (September-October 1982), Pages 25 and 26</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image165.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="MidNightBlue"><b>Kumara-gan.a-nath'amba, Tushtih.

Today, if it is the first day of Navarātri, let us see what have we done? Have we been able to develop our innocence within ourselves? When people talk, they are so sharp. How can you be sharp if you are innocent? They are so bumptious. How can you be that if you are innocent? People play games. How can you do that if you are innocent? Harm each other. How can it be, if you are innocent? So, first of all, you have to see yourself, that the power of innocence, if it has to live, all the rest of the nonsense has to go away.

[King] Dakṣha did not invite Lord Śhiva in the Havana that he performed and Śhailaputrī was the consort of Lord Śhiva. She is called Satī because She entered the Holy fire of Havana and ablated Herself. But by then Lord Śhiva reached there. He lifted her burnt up body from the fire. Burnt pieces of the body of Śhailaputrī fell at many places. All these places are considered to be Śhakti Pīṭhas, the places of worship, as there is in Vindhyāchala and many other places. Her power moves there and it is said that it Sanctifies everything. Her seventh power is considered to be the Power of Destruction. Śhakti manifested Itself on the right side as Sāvitrī and Gāyatrī but the destroying force was manifested in the center. In the form of Durgā and Her other forms manifested in Heart chakra. She is present there.
