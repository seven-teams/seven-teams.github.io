The joy was dancing in your eyes. I could see the lights in your eyes and this is the real Diwālī.<br /> Diwālī word comes from two words: ‘dīpa’ and ‘āwali’. Dīpa means, you know, lights, and āwali means rows, rows and rows of lights. Seems it’s a very, very ancient idea and all over in the world, you see, whenever they have to celebrate something then they put lights. And lights because light gives joy, gives happiness. So to overcome the darkness of ignorance also we have to enlighten ourselves. And that is why is important that everybody should get Self-realization to feel the light within themselves. And you must have noticed that after Realization the eyes also sparkle. There’s light in the eyes of every Sahaja Yogi."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1990-1021 Diwālī Pūjā (4th day after Diwālī Day), Touch Your Depth, Chioggia/Sottomarina, Venice, Italy</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image240.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="BlueViolet"><b>"Diwālī is supposed to be Enlightenment Day.</b><br /> But enlightenment within is: how much you are in thoughtless awareness.<br /> And everything works out, because you are the Ocean of it.

Is the second day is the Moon, that is the Moon came out of the sea. According to this mythology, the Lakṣhmī came out of the sea and with Her this Moon came out, which was only a two-day-old Moon, the New Moon but a two-day-old Moon, and this was regarded as the brother of Lakṣhmī, because they were born at the same time from the sea.

And the light is there which is an eternal light. These lights will be finished. We’ll have to light them every year. Not you people. You have eternal light and this light is going to spread Joy. What’s the problem of this world? The whole problem, you take it. There’s no joy. Simple as that – there’s no joy. If they had joy, they would not have done all these nonsensical things.<br /> There’s no joy. When you have joy, you don’t want to fight, you don’t want to do anything that is harmful.<br /> You don’t want to say anything after anyone, not only that but you do not want to have something that will spoil this Mother Earth or which will bring ecological problem. No, you just don’t want it, don’t want to do anything because it harms others. People feel unhappy about it whether it is here, India, anywhere. You just feel that ‘Why should I do such a thing which is not so congenial to others?’ I mean, it’s not joy-giving.<br /> So when you have joy, you have to be joy-giving and if you are not joy-giving that means there’s something lacking in your Sahaja Yoga and that’s why we have to come up now. We have to become Sahaja Yoginīs, Sahaja Yogis. That is joy-giving society. We can change our name if you like. If Sahaja Yoga is not good – Joy-giving Association."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1991-1110 Diwālī Pūjā (5th day after Diwālī Day), Joy and Happiness, Tent, Cabella Ligure, Italy</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image241.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="BlueViolet">"So, today we are celebrating a Diwālī of the lights of Sahaja Yoga.<br /> I don’t know what to say, in what State of Bliss I am.

The brothers and sisters day. Now the brothers’ and sisters’ relationship has to be very, very strong. And the purity of that relationship is to be maintained.<br /> It is not necessary that you should be born as brothers and sisters, not necessary. But you are born, because if you are realized Souls you are born as brothers and sisters. So that purity must be maintained in the society of Sahaja Yoga. Very important, that we should try to develop this situation that brothers and sisters are something very pure. Their relationships are very pure. And they should not be at all challenged. It is so much so that even if you call somebody your brother, he is your brother and the more you develop this relationship, the better your left Viśhuddhi will be. Because left Viśhuddhi is the relationship with God as a brother or with a Goddess as a sister."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1981-1101 Diwālī Pūjā (5th day after Diwālī Day), The Mahālakṣhmī Powers and the Powers of Water, Āśhram, 44 Chelsham Road, London, Clapham, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image242.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font size="+0"><b>Baba Mama (March 1990): This is what the brother has written for the sister: "O Nirmala, my sister, how much should I praise You?
