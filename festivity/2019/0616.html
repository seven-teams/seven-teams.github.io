"But then she dies and her intestines are drawn out into wires and some Saint fixes them on the tutari," that instrument that they have, ektāri as they call it, "and he goes on pulling it with his fingers, then it says, 'Tū hī, Tū hī, Tū hī,' " that is, "You are, You are, You are."

See the handicap of Kabīr. You have no handicaps. <b>Kabīr had no Mother to tell Him, no Mother to love Him, look after Him and tell Him all these things.</b> He had a Guru, and you know Kabīr’s life. Kabīr wanted to become the disciple of Rāmānanda Swāmī, but He was a Muslim or low caste or whatever it is, so He could not reach Rāmānand Swāmī. The disciples would not allow Him to go near Rāmānand Swāmī. So one day Kabīra went and slept on the steps of the River Ganges, all night in the cold waiting for Rāmānand Swāmī to come, because He used to always pass the same way. And His Feet fell on Kabīra and He said, “Oh My child, what are you doing here?”<br /> So Kabīra got up and He said, “Sir, You have accepted Me as Your disciple today.”<br /> He said, “Yes, I have.” And then Rāmānand Swāmī took Him and He trained Him into something great.<br /> You don’t have these handicaps, where Kabīra never had anybody to support him or help him around. Actually single-handed he fought the whole world. Horrible people were around him; even today those who are in his place in Patna or in all places where he lived – I was surprised that He described Kuṇḍalinī as ‘Surati’ and they described tobacco as ‘surati’. Such horrible nonsensical people, making fun of everything.,br&gt; There Kabīra lived and developed that heart. You don’t have all these handicaps at all. You all speak the same language, you live with the same ideas, you have your own Mother to tell you everything, so <b>you can develop the same heart as Kabīra had</b>.</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1987-0506 Talk to Sahaja Yogis, The Need to Go Deeper and Questions and Answers, Āśhram, 10 Clarence Street, Burwood, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image108.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"Kabira has described, <b>"Shunya shikhar par anahad baaje."</b><br /> On the silent apex there is the percussion of Anahata.<br /> Anahat is this “lub-dub” of the heart you feel there.<br /> And then when it breaks you start getting the cool breeze coming out of your head."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1984-0803 Public Program, Birmingham, UK</b></font><br /> <b>Nirbhay nirgun gun re</b><br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_buuncAm9Ts&amp;list=RD_buuncAm9Ts#t=0">video</a><br /></p><p> <font color="DarkGreen">"We ourselves, you see, prove that our religion is weak because we have not known the person who brought this religion on this Earth.

He says there, "Of compassion of my heart I make it vibrate," "tharakarā lau." "Pañcha hi tattwa chadhaunga ka." "In all the five elements I’ll put it."</b> Just look at the authority with which he talked! And while these Sanskrit ‘paṇḍitas’ are calling Him ‘Sadhukaddi’, this that, all sorts of things.
