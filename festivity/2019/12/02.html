He came onto this Earth to teach people the secrets of the Divine, to reveal God, and to help them cross the Ocean of Illusion themselves within their own identity. Evolution could not go further in the hands of human beings who were in the bondage of ignorance, so they were given guidance through this Incarnation of the Primordial Master (Ādi Guru) again and again in different lives. He was created as the three-headed child, Dattātreya, by Ādi Śhakti who appeared on Earth during the Tretā Yuga as Satī Anasūyā, wife of the Sage Atreya. He was born as Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara] who founded Jainism – one of the oldest religions. Then he was born as Rāja Janaka, father of Jānakī also called Sītā, Rāma’s wife. She was an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti.<br /> The Primordial Master was also born as Macchindranāth, and again as Zoroaster who was worshiped by the ancient Persians, and still revered by Parsis. Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism. In China, He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tzu, and in Greece as Socrates. He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigamber) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā). Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918. Altogether there were ten major Avatāras of Dattātreya."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>The Book of Ādi Śhakti, Chapter 2: Divine Incarnations – Ambassadors of God, Pages 32 and 33</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image264.png" /></div><p style="color:DarkGreen; text-align:center;"> <b>Brahma Vishnu Mahesh ki Abodhita hai Adiguru<br /> Dattatrey hai Matreya hai<br /> Dattatrey hai Matreya hai Trigunatmika Nirmala mayi<br /> Adiguru Janak Laotze<br /> Socrates Sai Nirmala mayi</b><br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnW3jwrIwA">video</a></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"Today is Shrī Datta Jayanti [birthday].

The guru has to be a complete personality to talk about these Statutes and to elevate his disciples to this level of understanding, by which they imbibe those Statutes. He is there to fulfill this gap, and for that, it is essential that every guru has to be a realized Soul of a very high quality and greatly evolved. He need not be a person who is an ascetic, or he need not be a person who is living in the forest. He could be a common householder, he could be a king. All these outward manifestations of one’s life do not matter. Whatever may be your position, I would say the so-called position in this world makes no difference to your being a guru, as long as you have imbibed the Statutes of the Lord. Again, I say you have to imbibe the Statutes."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1980-0727 Guru Pūjā, Temple of all Faiths, Hampstead, London, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image267.png" /></div><p style="color:DarkGreen; text-align:center;"> <b>Guru hamari Adishakti, Karale he man. in.ki bhakti,<br /> Inke hi guna gaye oh ...</b><br /> <font size="+0"><b>My Guru is the Adishakti, O my heart, please do Her Bhakti,<br /> Please sing Her praises only ...</b></font><br /> <b>Aei maan Guru Sharan. me rahio, rahio,<br /> He man Ma ki Sharan.
