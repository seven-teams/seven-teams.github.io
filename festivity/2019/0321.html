Human beings also, express there gratitude. Expression of gratitude and love is done in different, different ways in different countries, but the substance remains the same and the forms change.<br /> The substance is like the ocean which flows continuously towards the shores and the ripples which touch the shores are again repelled back, and a nice pattern is formed. It is such a spontaneous thing and is so beautiful, creates such a beautiful pattern in the atmosphere. All these waves when they weave together the pattern of love they soothe human beings, they enchant human beings and the whole thing is very blissful.<br /> On such occasions a special type of feelings develop, which we cannot express in words so the expression could be in any form. But the main thing is the expression. <b>God has expressed Himself by Creation, by creating this Creation. While the Creation has to express its gratitude by glorifying Him, and this play must go on eternally. It’s the most beautiful play.</b> Those who indulge into this play lead an eternal life.

We have to think of all those today who are away from us, thousands of miles, praying to God Almighty for their spiritual ascent. One has to only pray for the spiritual ascent because as you ascend you get all the rest of it; because you do not ascend you do not get what is needed. That is why there are problems and even today I had to solve some problems before I could come to Pūjā.<br /> But if you decide that we have to ascend spiritually within us then everything that you have to receive, all the blessings that God wants to shower upon you, to make you the citizen of His great Kingdom, where you are no more judged, you are no more chastised, you are no more put to any test, and where you will reside in Eternal Love of God and in His glory.<br /> ......<br /> <b>First of all, you have to know you are Prophets and you must know that I am the Holy Ghost.
