This place has so many vibrations, even in the advertisement."<br /> So you can imagine how the guidance comes. It comes from vibrations, and that's how I was here and thiss [this] place was selected by the Divine Force. It happened only in one day. Such a miraculous thing to happen in one day! It was taking so much time for them even to get this, and suddenly I told them, "Better get it." All worked out, and we are now here in the most beautiful atmosphere.<br /> Of course, you know that Red Indians were driven out, and they came here to hide themselves. They were hiding themselves in this place so that they should not be crushed and destroyed forever. That era is over now! That era of domination, of entering into somebody else's land and occupying it, and considering it to be a great bravery, all that is over now, the human understanding has gone much beyond, and they understand that, 'This is sinful, this is wrong. Whatever we have done was wrong.' But those people are no more. And the children and the grandchildren of those children, of these people who were the children of God, they used to think, do not like all that.

Not what I am saying, or what I am spreading, or what I am working out. It's a fact that I always had a feeling that Sahaja Yogis should take to social work. I've been a social worker all My life, and I am a socialist in a way, but all these things I did, you may call it secretly, or anything, whatever it is, but some people knew about it, and this was to be done, and practically most of these cases are ready to be donated.<br /> The reason I did not donate it in the beginning [is] because I wanted to see [that] there are people who are honest, and who will do the work honestly. Because in the name of social work, people just want to exploit. This is the reason I waited for so many days, and though I have given some of these already like Gaṇapatīpuḷe, or the hospital, also Dharmaśhālā school, all have been given. But now I want to give even more. Like I didn't know that, <b>in America, the land we have bought, in Canajoharie, is in My name; and I heard it I was surprised because there is no income from there, nothing of the kind, and I decided there and then, that it has to be given to the collective of Life Eternal Trust of America. It's all My desire that things should work out. But according to Sahaja Yoga, unless and until you have your Gaṇapati, Gaṇeśha, mother of land, motherland, where you start your work, it doesn't take form, it doesn't do anything.</b>"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>2000-1029 Talk to Sahaja Yogis (3rd day after Diwālī Day), after Diwālī Pūjā, Lake Piru Recreational Area Campground, 4780 Piru Canyon Rd, Piru (87 kms NW of Los Angeles), CA, U.S.A.</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image157.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font size="-1"><b>1999-0620 Śhrī Ādi Śhakti Pūjā, Sahaja Yogis Have to Transform Others, Hangar, Nirmal Nagarī, 287 Starkville Road, Fort Plain (5 kms NW of Canajoharie), NY, U.S.A.</b></font><br /> <font color="Maroon"><b>Thank You, O Shri Adi Shakti, for the seeking which brought us to Sahaja Yoga.<br /> You now lift up humanity into the omega of the Last Judgment.<br /> You have incarnated on this Earth for the Last Judgement.<br /> We pray that Shri Adi Shakti’s love continues to protect all the saints and seekers around the world.<br /> Shri Adi Shakti, Your work is greater than any.<br /> You created the pithas, the chakras, nature and humanity, and its subtle workings.<br /> May the complexity of Your work humble us down completely</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"The - another greatest thing that you get is love and compassion, love and compassion which acts, which works.
