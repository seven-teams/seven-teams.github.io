When He was born and He was a child ... <b>He is a Sūryavaṃśhi, He is the son of Sūrya. I mean Sūrya – everything comes from the Sun to Him.</b> When He was born and was a little child, He asked His mother that “I would like to have the Moon.” He started crying, and nobody knew how to satisfy. He said “I want to have the Moon.” They gave him any toys – he’d throw away. They said, “What a child it is, funny thing ... He wants to have the Moon, now how to get Him the moon?” They did not know how to solve the problem.<br /> He said, "Somehow you get Me the Moon. I don’t want to eat or anything, I want to have the Moon."<br /> Here the Moon represents the Ātmā, the cooling capacity. He asked for the Moon. You are all on the right side, so ask for the Moon. Ask for the Spirit. And they didn’t know how to satisfy this Śhrī Rāma, who was the Incarnation of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, asking for the Moon of all the things, not for anything else. What is so important? So, the mother has always a[n] intuition. She brought a ... it’s a, it’s a Rāmāyaṇa, it is a beautiful drama. She brought a mirror and showed Him the Moon in the mirror. He said, “Now you can get the Moon here.” So sweet! And He was satisfied. Even the reflection of that can satisfy. You are like the mirrors and I want to see the reflection of Moon in you."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1982-0125 Talk to Sahaja Yogis, Growth of the Being on the Subtler Plane (Count Your Blessings, Take Responsibility of Sahaja Yoga, Understand the Subtler Values of Everything, The Greatest Thing for a Sahaja Yogi Is the Living Energy, Be Sweet in Your Tongue, Just Open Your Heart, Great Power of Love, Take Up Love as Your Worshiping), Seminar, Day 3, Session 1 (morning), Lonavala, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image83.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"Rāma was studying with this Vasiṣhṭha and they used to come for holidays to father’s place.<br /> Then, he had the capacity to kill a demon with only one arrow.<br /> It’s called as Ekabāṇi."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1982-0402 Śhrī Rāma Pūjā, Rāma Navamī, Āśhram, 44 Chelsham Road, Clapham, London, UK</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"Śhrī Rāma came on this Earth to establish the institution of benevolent king. The political development and the political evolution started from this [right] side. He is the one who gave leadership as a benevolent king, the one who represents God and who is a king. The idea of a king related to God came from Śhrī Rāma. But the modern kings are not like that, they have no relation with God.<br /> On the contrary, they are horrid people. Some of them are nothing but satanic people, absolutely Satan is there and you can see from the way they lead their lives, and they have led their life before. So the benevolence of Śhrī Rāma is here [shows the right Heart] to be followed by all the political leaders and all the people who are at the helm of affairs. He is the ideal that was created for human beings, to run their authority as the head, or the loving compassionate benevolent leader of the people, who has to govern them by making them respectful, by respect. And if human beings create such things who are not respectable, those who have no human values, those who have no moral courage, those who are selfish, those who are self-centered, then they have nothing to do to be there.<br /> So this is the position of Rāma who is the Father. So the head of every state has to be the father of his subjects, that’s what He has tried to show by His life. So much so that He had to sacrifice His beloved Wife, whom He loved so much."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1981-0929 Public Program (1st Day and 2nd Day of Navarātri), Self and Heart Chakra, Day 6, East West Center, 141 5th Avenue, Manhattan, New York City, NY, U.S.A.</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image84.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="blue">Thumak chalat Raamachandra<br /> Thumak chalat Raamachandra<br /> Baajat painjaniyaan</font><br /> (Baby) Shri Ram walks, swaying unsteadily<br /> (Baby) Shri Ram….
