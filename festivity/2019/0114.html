For the information of the foreign Sahaja Yogis, I will explain to you what it means.<br /> ......<br /> <b>It means the day, today is the day the Sun crosses over from the Tropic of Capricorn to the Tropic of Cancer.</b> It is a very big day for us because, now during the summertime we have the harvest, and we look forward to the rain and so many things that happen in every country. The Sun falls at right angles in this country during the summer season and so we welcome the Sun. <b>We eat something -- that you must have eaten already -- what we call as til and jaggery.</b> It is to prepare your body and your mind to give it sufficiency to receive the Sun. Because if you are living in the cool season, then all your body, mind becomes lethargic and you become also sometimes very lazy about things in the sense, that the day is so small, that you cannot achieve many results. So the body has become cold as we call it. We take these things, which give us heat so body is prepared to receive the heat of the Sun to welcome.

First of all, your own step should be enlightened, and then you must establish new steps to go ahead. And these are the new steps which are different for the Westerners and different for the Easterners.<br /> Just now I told them about the Eastern style and then I'll tell you later on about the Western. We have to have new ideals, new styles because we are the courageous people, we are the valiant people. We'll have to fight the War of Love, through Love. And it's a very delicate thing.

You know the heart goes into a tantrum. At that time they say that you take the sweet.<br /> This sweet is a heated thing because now the Sun is moving towards the other side. That time also they, to give it a balance, they say: “Speak very sweetly. Use sweet words, use sweetness. Bring sweetness in your language.” Which is very important, you understand that.<br /> And this is one of the religions we have to accept that we will not use harsh words to each other and then later on to others. First of all to each other. There are many people who’ll be kind to others because others will eat them off but unkind to their own Sahaja Yogis. Because it is a universal happening. It’s the whole thing is working out universally. Even if you organize, you organize for the whole. Those who are organizing have no business to be harsh and those who are not organizing has [have] no business to be slow. We must move with the same speed, with the same understanding."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1981-0114 Makar Saṅkrānti Pūjā (Marathi+English), Ahitagni Rajwade Maṅgal Karyalaya, 840 Sadashiv Peth, Pune, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image120.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"...... when on the Saṅkrānti, when the day changes, on the 14th of January when the Sun changes over, then they give the sweet, [unclear] saying that, ‘We’ll give you the sweet and speak to us in the same way in a sweet manner’ – so friendship. <b>Sugar gives you friendship. You give sweets to people to establish friendship.</b>"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1982-1009 Bestowing of Boons Pūjā, House of Maria Laventzi, Irchester (near Wellingborough), UK</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"And this is the day when we celebrate it, in a way to surrender ourselves to the Sūrya, to the Sun which is, as you know, is the residence of Śhrī Lord Jesus Christ. He resides on the Sun. So how humble He was, how humble He was residing on the Sun. The more you live on the Sun, there should be much more humility. Of course I must say in India, people are humbler. But still, the quality of Sun can make you extremely arrogant and very unpleasant person. This unpleasant person can really ruin all kinds of good relations. But the worst thing that happens to us, is that we lose our integration. Because when we say harsh things to anyone we feel guilty, so we have another problem, our heart feels bad, our liver feels bad everything is upset and thus you feel absolutely disintegrated. And this disintegrated is the sign of our not evolving at all, or we should say devolving.<br /> This integration is such a common thing that we see, in ourselves, we see that we fight with our ego, then we fight with our superego, then we fight with our heart with our emotions and all the time we are fighting within ourselves. So at least, within ourselves we should speak sweetly on this day. Then we can start speaking to others very, very sweet. Now some people think, to speak sweetly is a sign of weakness.<br /> In some countries people believe that if you speak to someone sweetly, it is a sign of weakness. It is the greatest [unclear time/strike ...] of Sahaja Yogi to speak to others with respect with proper protocol and with proper understanding."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1985-0114 Makar Saṅkrānti Pūjā (English+Marathi), We Are Going to Make Peace with Ourselves and with Others (We Will Take to Peaceful Methods), Suryavanshi Hall (near Śhivajī Park), Dadar, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image121.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>Aum twameva sakshat Shri Deva- Karya sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devyai namo namah!</b><br /> O Divine Mother, You are verily the one who does the Divine work.
