The Saints were respected – I’m telling you in India – real Saints were respected, and they made different observations.<br /> Now when I read, say Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, I am amazed how He knows so many things about Me. He knows how My knee looks like, He knows how many lines I have on My back, how many – I mean, it is very amazing how this man knows everything about Me. That means through His meditative power He could envisage Me – He never saw Me. The description and everything is so clear-cut. Now if you say the thousand names of the Goddess, thousand names of the Goddess are so precise. I mean, you can verify them in Me, I am just like that. Whatever it is, good or bad, whatever is said about Me is there, is a fact. And it is the knowledge of these people is most remarkable: how did they know that a Goddess is like that? Certain of My things which I also don’t know, but they are there, and they have described. It’s very surprising.<br /> So their meditative power in India was great. The reason was, our seasons were disciplined, people are disciplined."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1992-0927 Navarātri Pūjā (1st Day), 10th Position or Divine Knowledge is the Reality, Tent, Cabella Ligure, Italy</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image170.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="MidNightBlue"><b>Namo Devyai Mahādevyai</b><br /> Salutations to the Devī, to the Mahādevī,<br /> <b>Śhivāyai satataṃ namaḥ,</b><br /> To You who is ever Auspicious,<br /> <b>Namaḥ prakṛutyai bhadrāyai</b><br /> To You who is the Primordial Cause,<br /> <b>Niyyatāḥ praṇatāḥ sma tām</b><br /> And the Sustaining Power, we bow to You.</font><br /> <b>(from 'Devī Sūktam' in Devī Māhātmyam)</b></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"So you are the goddess of the family, you have the śhakti and you have to be very careful.

As you know, according to Sahaja Yoga, England is the heart where resides the Spirit of Śhiva. And that Virgin should be respected and revered and worshiped in England is a great honor, I think, for all the Sahaja Yogis.<br /> Now one has to think why such an importance is paid to a Virgin? Why a Virgin is respected to that extent? What are the Powers of a Virgin? That She can bear a child of that magnitude that was Christ, that She could create Śhrī Gaṇeśha out of Her own body, that She could protect innocent, dynamic force of Her children who are egoless, who have not known what is ego. So this Great Power and Force resides in a person who has lots of pūrva puṇyas, who has done lots of good things in previous lives, who has always understood that Virginity is a power higher than any other power and would save the Virginity and Chastity with all her effort and care. As you know that within our body She is placed as Kuṇḍalinī.<br /> Means She is the Virgin. She is untouched. The desire to become Spirit is without any blemish: Nirmal. There is no blemish. It’s waiting is pure. There is no other desire, but to be one with the Divine. All other desires are finished."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1982-1017 Navarātri Pūjā (1st Day), Innocence and Virginity (Your Śhakti Is Your Kuṇḍalinī and She Is Virginity or A New Page Has Been Turn), Temple of All Faiths, Hampstead, London, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image172.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"But Goddess Herself has done so many things for us already, within us, though we are not aware of it.<br /> Is said that, "<b>Yā Devī Sarvabhūteśhu</b>," "All those whom You have created," means mostly the human beings, 'What do You do?<br /> As what do You exist inside the human beings?'<br /> Now, just introspect if you have these qualities within you or not, because they are given to you by the Goddess, by the Śhakti within you."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1997-1005 Navarātri Pūjā (6th Day), Cabella Ligure, Italy</b><br /> <b>Yā Devī Sarvabhūteśhu</b> 2000-1008 Navarātri Pūjā, Cabella</font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image173.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="MidNightBlue"><b>Kamala-dal’āmala komala kāntī<br /> Kalā kalit’āmala bhāla-late,<br /> Sakala vilāsa kalā nilaya-krama<br /> Keli chalat-kala haṁsa kule,<br /> Ali-kula sañkula kuvalaya mandala<br /> Mauli milad bakulāli kule, Jaya, jaya, he</b></font><br /> Like a tender, lovely spotless Lotus-petal the crescent Moon adorns Your forehead;<br /> Your movements are like a graceful and playful group of Swans;<br /> Like a swarm of bees to fragrant flowers, the stars adorn Your forehead.

So, you see, the Islam follows the star, the inside, and below that is this, what you call, they call it the Moon. But that’s the half mudrā, or we can call it the half ...... of the coil. But half, according to the Western mind, half means it’s bad. But half is the one that takes everything within itself. You see, the one like the bottom of the sea. Bottom of the sea is always bigger than the sea itself. So this ... the half Śhakti takes all the Śhaktis into itself. And the Bindu represents the heart or we can say the Atma. So is the complete thing, is the Ādi Śhakti and the Bindu. That’s the Islam seal. And in the same way this is the seal, this is the seal of the Ādi Śhakti, is a half-circle. Is not even half -- we shouldn’t say now first night’s Moon and a star. And why this it is used? Because this is the thing coming from the creation, from the nature.
