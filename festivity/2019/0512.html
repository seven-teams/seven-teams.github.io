So He said "to Mother" -- "to the Mother."<br /> Then again they asked Him, He said: "Only the Mother." Again they asked Him, He said: "Only the Mother."<br /> I'm sure He must have said about the Divine Mother, because worldly mothers may not be complete mothers, perhaps. They are a[n] embodied, or, we can say, examples of Mother's Love, of the Divine Mother's Love, but they are human.<br /> So they can be conditioned, influenced or could be egoistical, especially if they are living in a particular country for a long time and have no idea of Divine Love.<br /> In Divine Love there is no expectations, it just flows, it doesn't think how to judge a person or what to do for a person, it just flows."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>2001-0513 Talk to Sahaja Yogis (Mother's Day), Living Room, Palazzo Doria, Cabella Ligure, Italy</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image98.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="Indigo"><b>Thank You</b> for descending from Your heavenly abode, Mata Dwipa, to bring light into the darkness of Kali Yuga.<br /> <b>Thank You</b>, Shri Mataji, again and again.<br /> <b>Thank You</b> for giving Sahaja Yoga to a confused and self-destructive humanity.<br /> <b>Thank You</b> for revealing to us the meaning of creation and evolution.<br /> <b>Thank You</b> for revealing to us the actual existence of God.<br /> <b>Thank You</b> for giving divine meaning to human existence.<br /> <b>Thank You</b> for revealing to us within the human body the reflection of the Vishwa-rupa (universal form).</font><br /> <b>The 108 Thank Yous were offered to Shri Mataji on the occasion of Sahasrara Puja in Cabella on 1996-0505</b><br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP_R9tpOVag">video</a></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"Today is, I like the day when it is a Mother’s, I should say, Mother's day also, because I think only a mother can work it out that way. One has to have lots of patience with people. What I’ve seen about all these great incarnations who came, they just disappeared; in a very short time they lived, very short time. Somebody was crucified about 33 years of age. Somebody took a samadhi at 23 years of age. Because I think they couldn’t bear the way people were stupid. They couldn’t see the point that they could do something for human beings. They lost their confidence I think, or maybe that they thought it’s useless to work for these people. Like that they took a position that, it’s better to disappear.<br /> But Mother’s position is different, She’ll go on struggling and fighting for her child. She’ll fight it out to the last to see that the child gets all the benefits. And this patience and this love and this forgiveness is innately built in a mother, see, because her attitude is very different. Not any achievement, not any big name or a, what you call a sort of an award or anything. It is just she does it because she is a mother. And that is what is the sign of any mother, if she’s a real mother, at least for her own children, she will go all out, she will work out everything for day in and day out and try to save the child from disaster."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1998-0510 Sahasrāra Pūjā, Blessing of the Divine Pours Only if the Sahasrāra is Open (Meditation Is the Only Way You Can Enrich Yourself with the Beauty of Reality), Hangar, Cabella Ligure, Italy</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image99.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="RebeccaPurple">May I this day be what You'd have me be.<br /> May I this day say what You'd have me say.<br /> May I this day be part and parcel of the whole<br /> And may my thoughts be of a realized soul.<br /> May I this day have love for all mankind.<br /> Mother, be in my heart and in my mind.</font><br /></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"Now, [the] Principle of Mother is in every, every Scripture, has to be there. Now the Mother’s character is that She is the One Who is the Womb, She is the One Who is the Mother Earth and She is the One Who nourishes you. She’s ... She nourishes us, you know that. And this feminine thing in a one ma... in every human being resides as this Kuṇḍalinī, as you have seen. And when She rises, She gives you this new awareness which becomes compassion, which is flowing, which becomes soothing, nourishing Energy of Love. And that’s what today people are saying feminist go this thing and all that. That’s again a pendulum – a man becoming a woman, woman becoming man – all these problem you have had because of this. But when you move spirally upward, then where do you move? You move, become a personality full of compassion, of love, of universal understanding, through Collective Consciousness. And then you rise up to a position where you become universally conscious. So that is what should happen to you. And, if that happens, then we should say that your motherly qualities within you have risen. And that’s what we have so far neglected. You do not become a woman but you become motherly. First the Father, then the Son, and now the Mother!
