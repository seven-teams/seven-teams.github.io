The God who has ‘all the powers’ and all the loved ones. He is our Father, He is waiting for us to enter into His Kingdom, to enjoy that peace and beauty of His Being, because He has created us and He wants this creation to come up to that.<br /> <b>Today, the great day of Holikā Dahana, where the symbolism of this occasion is that the Satanic forces were burnt by the innocence of Prahlada.</b> And that is what we have to remember, that when the Sahaja Yogis take to innocence and complete dependence on to their vibratory awareness, which is the indication of God’s Manifestation through them, they are ‘completely’ protected, and even a satanic person like Holika could not burn him [them]. And this is the day today, we have to ‘recognize’ that as Sahaja Yogis we stand no dangers in life. We are fearless people, but we are humble people, loving people and anxious to save as many as possible. To raise the whole humanity into another awareness, in the process of your evolution you have to achieve, for which you have to work hard. As Tukārāma has said very clearly: “Yéryā gabādyāche Kām nohé” – This is the work of the Great Virās. Only the courageous can do it."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1983-0328 Public Program (Holikā Dahana), Concept and Reality, Birthday Celebration, Ajwan-E-Ghalib, New Delhi, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image132.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"As you know, on the day of Holi, Holika was burnt.

She was the sister of Hiraṇyakaśhipu, the father of Prahlāda. Since Prahlāda was the devotee of Lord Viṣhṇu, his father, the demon king, used to harass and trouble him. Hiraṇyakaśhipu wanted to kill Prahlāda. Holikā had the boon that fire won’t burn her. Hiraṇyakaśhipu asked Holikā to take the boy Prahlāda in her lap and sit on the burning pyre, thinking that she could not be burnt. But to his surprise Holikā was burnt to ashes and no harm done to the child devotee of Śhrī Viṣhṇu! It was a significant incident which proved that it is sin to be cruel, arrogant and aggressive. Despite her boon, Holikā was burnt down and no harm done to the innocent child – devotee! Such is the myth and traditionally we burn Holī every year. There lies a lot of truthfulness in all our traditions. We have to understand that misdeeds, cruelties and troubling others are evil tendencies."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>2002-0329 Holī Pūjā (Hindi) (Holī Raṃgavalī), Palam Vihar, Gurgaon, Haryana, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image133.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"So like that you see different colors are spread on the face ......<br /> red color, is the sign of innocence.

Every chakra has got different color. So what happens? These colors just get distributed in the air, in the atmosphere. During Holi time you [know you?] are representing those colors which are completely permeating into the atmosphere. So this is an-other thing when you play colors. When you color another person, you are just expressing that these, your chakras will be blessed. <b>Red color is of the Mooladhara.</b> All those colors that you use here are of different chakras. So just you are making the whole expression of your love that let it be you become completely filled with red color, means innocence, means innocence. Because as a child in the womb of the mother just sees the red color of the mother, color of the blood. So like that you see different colors are spread on the face. ...... red color, is the sign of innocence. So Kabira says that, “You put me into such a color. Oh, the one who is going to color me is the One”. Rangaraj is the one who colors things. So He says, “Oh Rangaraj, make me so that the whole thing becomes red – innocence, fills me up with complete innocence.” And innocence is the one he has asked for to be filled in. And same is <b>with Shri Krishna that He played with all these different colors to show that there are different charkas within us apart from the red and the others that are there. All of them play a part to create a beautifully joyful personality.</b>"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1984-0317 Talk to Sahaja Yogis (English+Hindi+English), Raṃgavalī Holī Celebration, Universal Sahaja Yoga Temple, Āśhram, 78 Kṛiṣhṇa Nagar, Safdarjung Enclave, New Delhi, India</b></font></p><p> <font color="blue">"This festival of Holī was made by Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa so that human beings would see the whole world as Līlā (play). By coming into Sahaja Yoga you have become Līlāmay (playful). You get completely absorbed in music and enjoy it. You have love and pure feelings for one another. You do each work with great beauty and morality. But to be Līlāmay is to stop at Viśhuddhi chakra. After that one has to move on Āgñyā. On the Āgñyā chakra is Tapa or penance. Then you should think about the burning of Holikā which was due to Prahlād’s penance. We also have to ascend on that Tapa because you have reached the Viśhuddhi level; that you live together with love for each other. At Viśhuddhi you have become collective, got love and universal brotherhood. When you become universal, then your caste, creed, countries all drop away."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1991-0228 Talk to Sahaja Yogis (Hindi+English), Raṃgavalī Holī Celebrations, New Delhi, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image134.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"On Holī we should burn all those things which spoil our attention and damage the Āgñyā.<br /> Then this attention will clear out and we will celebrate Holī with joy and understanding.<br /> The day the complete combination of this will happen then on both chakras the similarity will come."</font><br /> <b>1991-0228 Talk to Sahaja Yogis (Hindi+English), Raṃgavalī Holī Celebrations, New Delhi, India</b></p><font size="+2"><b>Suggested Talk:</b></font> <font size="+0">1991-0228 Talk to Sahaja Yogis (Hindi+English), Raṃgavalī Holī Celebrations, New Delhi, India</font><p><a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html"> video</a><br /></p><font size="+2"><b>Bhajans:</b></font><p> <font color="green"><b>Baba Mama’s famous bhajan talks of these colors: Rang de jihni hari Ma ke rang me kaya (meaning, 'O Lord, please color my entire body in the color of my Divine Mother.')</b></font><br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAvt3cDa0Y&amp;list=PL12CE57584C21BCE2"> video</a><br /></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Abir Gulal</b></font><br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjPTm04s6l8">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Krishna Govinda</b></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Holi Khelat</b></font><br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnbVgjyEyp4">video</a></p><p style="text-align:left;"> <font color="DarkBlue">Wishing</font> <font color="red">you</font> <font color="orange">all</font> <font color="blue">a</font> <font color="DarkGreen">very</font> <font color="DarkRed">Happy Holi!</font><br /></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image135.png" /></div><p> <font size="+0">Jai Śhrī Mātājī!<br /> On behalf of the festivity team!</font></p></section><footer class="page__meta"></footer><nav class="pagination"> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/festivity/2019/0303" class="pagination--pager" title="2019 International Shri Shiva Puja: “Try to follow the qualities of Shri Mahadeva” ">Previous</a> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/festivity/2019/0321" class="pagination--pager" title="2019 Celebrating Shri Mataji’s Birthday ">Next</a></nav></div></article></div><script src="https://seven-teams.github.io/assets/js/main.min.js"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', '', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script src="https://unpkg.com/vanilla-back-to-top@7.2.1/dist/vanilla-back-to-top.min.js"></script> <script>addBackToTop()</script></body></html>
