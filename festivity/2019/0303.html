On the outside, we can gain mastery on our body, its movements, the mind, ego and various functions. Whatever is there in the universe, we can know it and use it like whatever elements that there are in the earth, and what grows, we can use them. We can gain complete supremacy over all this. But this is all an outside manifestation. What we are within is the Spirit. We are Śhiva. What is on the outside is destructible. What is born will die. What is created will be destroyed. But what is within, is our Ātmā, who is our Śhiva, who is a reflection as Sadāśhiva, is indestructible, desireless and free. It is not stuck to anything. It is stainless. By obtaining that Śhiva, and getting the Light of that Śhiva, we also slowly get renounced. The outside remains as it is, but within, is the Ātmā – permanent and indestructible, always emitting its light."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1990-0223 Śhivarātri Pūjā (Hindi), Ātma-sākṣhātkārī kī Viśheṣhatāem̐ (Attributes of Self-realization), Flora Palace, Pune, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image127.png" /></div><p style="color:Indigo; text-align:center;"> <b>Pranava swaroopaya, chidakasaya, Aakasa dik swaroopaya, Graha nakshatra maline, Sakalaya, Kalanka rahithaya, Sakala lokaika karthre, Sakala lokaika bharthre,<br /> Sakala lokaika samharthre, SAkala lokaika gurave,<br /> Sakala lokaika Sakshine, Sakala nigama guhyaya,</b><br /> <br /> <font size="-1"><b>He who is the form of “Om”, He who is the divine ether, He who is personification of sky and directions, He who wears stars and planets as Garlands,<br /> He who is everything, He who does not have any dark spot, He who creates all the world, He who manages all the worlds,<br /> He who destroys all the worlds, He who is the teacher of all the world, He who is a witness of all the world, He who is hiding in all reasoning.</b><br /> Shiva Kavach<br /> Sage Rishabha, from Skanda Purana</font><br /></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"While drinking the poison of the whole world, you all know this that He drank the whole poison in the beginning and whatever is the poison of the world drinking that <b>He keeps this world cool and give happiness to the world.</b> Whatever thing that becomes dead, finished, all that is resided in His Kingdom and those who are greatest evil, there prison get closed from the dust of his feet.

He lives with bones and things like that. He is not bothered about where He is, what He lives with, what He has, nothing. <b>So detached, and we should be detached like that.</b><br /> <b>At the same time, we should be very loving like Him, extremely loving.</b> How His heart is full of love for others, how He looks after others. I am warning you, because I know you all love Me very much, but you should also love each other, you should have a loving heart, and have satisfaction in loving others. If you could develop that, your height will grow, your depth in Sahaja Yoga will grow. It's all right, the Goddess gives you the śhraddhā, all right, but the depth of śhraddhā, in Sanskrit, or in Hindi and Marathi I don't know, but in Marathi they call it dyas [śhraddhā]. Just deep in to that love, drenched in to that love, enjoying that love -- then you don't want anything. What do you want? You've got everything. So what do you want now? Just like the greatness of Śhrī Mahādeva. He's so great that He's detached. What does He want? I mean nothing is greater than Him, nothing is more important than Him. Then what does He want? He doesn't want anything. That's why He's detached.

The Moon is the brother-in-law of Śhiva. So it was taken so close to Moon that the whole Earth got covered with ice. And it was then gradually moved towards the Sun. When it was moved towards the Sun, gradually then it started melting. And the point that did not melt at all was the point where Śhiva was to be established. That was – and is still that spot, and that spot is the Kailāśh. The ice never melts there and if you see the whole mountain is like the face of Śhiva – the eyes, the nose and everything you can see clearly getting out – and all the year round it keeps its shape as it is.<br /> <b>That is how Śhiva was created, and He was placed in a Witness State, as a spectator of all that happens on this Earth.</b>"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1982-0220 Śhivarātri Pūjā, The Establishment of Lord Śhiva (We Have to Take Śhiva and Establish Him into the Virāṭ) and Śhiva Tattwa (What Makes Mother Pleased), New Delhi, India</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"So, today I hope we all pray that, `O Lord, give us strength and that source of attraction by which we give up all other attractions of all the pleasures of joy, of ego, of everything that we think of, but <b>we should fall into the pure joy form of the Śhiva Tattwa.
