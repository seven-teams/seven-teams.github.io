Where the Goddess took the form of Śhakti and killed the negative people. But those were easier days because negativity was understood by people and nobody sympathized. So this is what one has to understand that don’t sympathize with negativity. You’ll spoil them all. And always you’ll find such sympathies bring forth your character also that you are also slightly negative. Because to fight negativity in modern times is a very difficult task.<br /> You cannot kill anyone: if you kill somebody, then may be that such a person is a brother or a sister or something of somebody. Or such a person would be himself or herself a seeker. So best thing is to separate like a contagious disease, keep that person out, no sympathies. And get the person cured and enjoy the life, otherwise that person is not going to be helped. It has become a very individual fight. And it’s so troublesome and so disgusting. So to help Me out, you should not take any sides with negativity. That’s how you can help Me the most. This is what it is the Navarātri, the Pūjā that I give you powers to fight the negativity."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1985-1009 Talk to Sahaja Yogis, after the Public Program, Flat of Ruth and Kingsley Flint, Strasbourg, France</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image183.png" /></div><p style="color:MidNightBlue; text-align:center;"> <b>Viśhv'eśwarī twam paripāsi viśhwam</b><br /> O Goddess of the universe, You are its protector.<br /> <b>Viśhw’ātmikā dhārayas’īti viśhwam</b><br /> You are the universe, You are its support.<br /> <b>Viśhw’esha-vandyā Bhavatī bhavanti</b><br /> You are worshipped by the Lord of the universe.<br /> <b>Viśhw’āshrayā ye twayi bhakti-namrāhā</b><br /> Those who are devoted to You themselves become a refuge for all.<br /> <font size="-1"><b>(Devī Mahātmyam, Chapter 11, Nārāyanī Stotram, śhlokas 33 &amp; 35)</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"We decided to have this Pūjā of Durgā today that all negativity should be destroyed. So many Deities build up the body of Kālī. Every part of Her body was created by a Deity, looked after by a Deity, and is also, later on, is reflected in you all. So they say that God has made human beings in His own image, I would say, I’ve made you in My own image, all the Deities at your disposal. They’re all with you, and they have created you – if you see it minutely – it is the Deities who have brought forth all the beauty that you had. They have made all this beautiful congregation, beautiful transformation, and they have created such angelic people out of you. They are always working it out, but one thing you have to do is to have the drive. You had pure desire to ascend, but for what? You want to have the light, but for what? You want to become gurus, for what? To save people, for their salvation. Only through your channels, I can work out Sahaja Yoga. If I could work out Myself, I would have. It’s not a question of killing one rākṣhasa. God knows how many there are, rākṣhasas and rākṣhasas. And they are everywhere, even within you they were. Now they’ve gone out.<br /> So you have to do full justice to Sahaja Yoga, that’s very important."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1992-0725 Śhrī Durgā Mahākālī Pūjā, Paris, France</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image184.png" /></div><p style="color:MidNightBlue; text-align:center;"> <b>Kāla-rātrīm Brahma-stutām Vaishnavīm Skanda-mātaram<br /> Saraswatīm Aditim Dakṣha-duhitaram namāmah pāvanām śhivām</b><br /> <font size="-1">Salutations to the Goddess, Who is the darkest night,<br /> Who is praised even by Brahmadeva Himself,<br /> Who is the Power of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, The Mother of Śhrī Kārttikeya,<br /> Who is Saraswatī, Śhrī Aditi (Mother of the Gods),<br /> the Daughter of Dakṣha, and the Consort of Śhrī Śhiva.</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>Auṃ Twameva sākshāt Śhrī Skandamātā sākshāt<br /> Śhrī Ādi Śhakti Mātājī Śhrī Nirmalā Devyai namo namah</b></font><br /> <i>O Divine Mother, You are verily The mother of Śhrī Kārttikeya<br /> Salutations to You!</i><br /></p><blockquote></blockquote><p> <font color="DarkRed">"Śhrī Kārttikeya Himself has taken birth here!

So in this rāga I think because there are, the notes are spaced out. So either you could play it slow or you could play it fast. Nothing in between. That's why it is on a Durgā's style. You see, either She is extremely gentle or She is extremely horrifying. So because She has a double function: is one to look after Her children, and another is protect Her children from the devils. So She has to be very quick about it, to fight them, and to, in every way to frighten them and to be alert about it.<br /> So in the second part you all became very alerted I saw. In the first part you were having a lullaby because it was the Mother's Love that was playing. The second part you became alert, because She has to fight. Now, this is such a nice rāga because it gives you a better sense of security within yourself, builds up sense of security, and also as you know medically that it's important to build up this chakra because that gives you antibodies created. So to fight all the diseases, to fight all the foreign things which try to attack us.<br /> So this rāga is so apt, absolutely apt for today's atmosphere and for today's need. That we have to have the security of the Mother and the protection of the Mother and that all the evil forces must be finished from this world, and that's how this rāga has a very great significance ......"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1990-0819 Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa Pūjā, Hallowtree Scout Campsite, Nacton, Ipswich IP10 0JP, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image186.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="MidNightBlue"><b>Salutations to You O Goddess Chāmuṇḍā Nārāyanī,<br /> whose mouth was dreadful with its great teeth,<br /> Who wore a garland of human skulls as an ornament and killed the demon Muṇḍa.</b></font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>(Mahālakṣhmī Hymn, Chapter 11 of the Devī Mahātmyam)</b></font><br /> <br /> <font color="DarkRed"><b>"She gives us the protection.

And in this song the poet has sung for the rustic people, in their language. That, “Oh Mother, give us our Realization!” ‘Jogawa’ means the Yoga, the Union with the Divine and the Sahaja Yoga means spontaneous. It fills My heart to see how since long the seekers have been asking for this Union with the Divine. What a search! What a seeking!<br /> By the very simple people of the villages. Today we have so many people who are great Seekers of Truth. At the same time there are many people who are in the market, they are selling all kinds of things in the market, in the name of the Divine or God.<br /> One has to realize that this Union with the Divine works out through a living force. Just like a seed gets sprouted spontaneously when placed in the Mother Earth, in the same way this residual force of Kuṇḍalinī is sprouted. Now in the song when they are saying “Uday, uday, Ambe!” Then they are meaning – Ambe means the Kuṇḍalinī, ‘uday’ means now please awaken, awaken, awakend."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1988-0610 Public Program, University, Graz, Austria</b></font><br /> <font size="-1"><b>Jogwa 1, (Marathi 6), Śhrī Mātājī explains the meaning of the bhajan.</b></font><br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05wpMZ44Sxc">video</a></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image187.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font size="+0"><font color="MidNightBlue"><b>Victory be to You,<br /> O Devī Chāmuṇḍā (killer of Chaṇḍā and Muṇḍa),<br /> victory be to You who destroys the suffering of all living beings.<br /> Victory be to You, O Devī Who is present everywhere.<br /> Salutations to you O Kālarātrī (the longest night)<br /> (Argala Stotram)</b></font></font></p><font size="+2"><b>Suggested Talk:</b></font> <font size="+0">1997-1005 Navarātri Pūjā (6th Day), Your Beautiful Qualities Will Prove the Truth of Sahaja Yoga, Hangar, Cabella Ligure, Italy</font><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dugylWpq0eE"> video</a><br /></p><font size="+2"><b>Bhajans:</b></font><p> <font color="green"><b>Jagadambetza Jogwa</b></font><br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhrbN6oyXGA"> video</a><br /></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Śhrī Jagadambe Aye re</b></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Tere he Gun Gate hai</b></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image188.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font size="-1"><b>Of these Argala Hymns Śhrī Viṣhṇu is the ṛiṣhi, anuṣhṭup is the metre,<br /> Mahālakṣhmī is the Deity, and it is recited for the love of Śhrī Jagadambā as a part of Saptaśhatī.</b><br /> <b>Argala Strotrum</b><br /> in Sanskrit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVgW5k89t44">video</a><br /> Skandamātā is four-armed and rides on a lion.
