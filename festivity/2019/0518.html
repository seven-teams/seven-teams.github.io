That time, especially in India, we had two types of people: one, who were very ritualistic, trying to be extremely strict and disciplined; and the another were the people who were too much conditioned and were full of so-called devotion to God. So these two types of people were occupying the area of seekers. So it was necessary to neutralize these two styles of seekings."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1988-0723 Śhrī Buddha Pūjā, Tent, YMCA Camp Surf, 560 Silver Strand Blvd, Imperial Beach (21 kms S of San Diego), CA, U.S.A.</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image101.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>Aum twameva sākshāt Shrī Siddhārtha Gautama Buddha<br /> sākshāt Shrī Ādi Shakti Mātājī Shrī Nirmalā Devyai namo namah</b></font><br /> <b>O Divine Mother, You are verily Shri Buddha. Salutations to You!</b><br /></p><p> <font color="DarkGreen">"When Lord Buddha came on this earth he found the problem very intricate about God. Everybody was talking that they know God. And everybody's God was different, and in the name of God they were raising wars. So he decided that "don't talk of God anymore now". But everybody wants to talk of Him. "Better not talk of God at this moment when they are not knowing about their Spirit." So He just talked of the Self, the Spirit. But He said: "Buddham sharanam gacch ami", "Buddham sharanam gacch ami", I surrender myself to Buddha. Buddha means the one who knows, the one who has the knowledge, means the Realized soul. In Sahaja Yoga also we go step by step. First of all we have to know our Spirit, not through mental projection but with a spontaneous happening, which is a living happening. They think that human beings cannot do it."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1983-0616 Public Program, Day 1, Joy Has No Duality, Societe d'Encouragement pour l'Industrie Nationale, 4 Place St. Germain des Pres, 6th Arrondissement, Paris, France</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"Buddha was one of the very Great Incarnations in the sense that He was the son, one of the sons of Rāma who incarnated on this earth, Buddha, to occupy the highest life on this earth. So He had to take saṃnyāsa because without that He could not show that. But there was no need for anybody else to take saṃnyāsa. But in His case mistakes, I mean, why there were some mistakes about things, because when He tried all these tricks of saṃnyāsa, going here and there He never realized that this is all not needed.<br /> He was so tired and fagged out, that suddenly, spontaneous, the Primordial Mother Herself gave Him the Realization because He was so tired."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1979-0611 Public Program, How Aspects of God Are Expressed within Us, Caxton Hall, 10 Caxton Street, Westminster, London, UK</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkGreen">"So the Buddha's main thing – Buddha itself means Bodh, from Bodh. And the Bodh means, "To know the reality on your central nervous system" is the Bodh. You all have become now buddhas without giving up anything, because whatever He gave up was all nonsense. It was a myth. ……. But still one has to know that we have to have that principle of Buddha within ourselves. And what is that Principle of Buddha is that we have to do tapah."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>&lt;1992-0531 Śhrī Buddha Pūjā, The Search for the Absolute, Śhuddhi Camp (now The Hall, Shudy Camps Park), Shudy Camps, Cambridgeshire, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image102.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>"And ultimately, He was sitting under a banyan tree<br /> when suddenly His kundalini was awakened by Adi Shakti and He got His Realization.<br /> Then He realized that the reason for all this is the desire."</b></font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1991-0804 Śhrī Buddha Pūjā, You Must Become Desireless, Brielpoort Sports Hall, Deinze, Belgium</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkGreen">"So, this special thing is that we are worshiping a Deity on the right Āgñyā which makes you think too much, first of all, and also it makes you aggressive, and also it makes you a very right-sided. By this worship, you will become very mild, very gentle, very beautiful people and you’ll be able to see things much more clearly. Now this right side gives you a kind of a ego which troubles everyone, but you could never feel the trouble till you get into a very serious state. It gives you the overactivity of the brain and conscious mind works too hard. For that you are, you are not very hard working people, but you can see, first of all, that your mind is more active than your body. So, this Āgñyā chakra has to be controlled by Buddha, and that’s why we do Pūjā today."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1990-0514 Śhrī Buddha Pūjā, Saint Petersburg, Russia</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image103.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>"The Pūjā to Shrī Buddha is being performed<br /> today to open this chakra.<br /> At the level of the Āgñyā chakra there are thoughts.

People are befooling them, the media is befooling, all the doctors are befooling, all the psychologists are befooling, all the governments are befooling. I mean, I don’t know, everybody is befooled, because they’ve got ego. If they had no ego, they could not have been befooled. All these advertisements and all this hocus-pocus that’s going on, is because human beings have ego and they can’t see it.<br /> So we have to say, <b>'Mother, please take away this curse of ego from Americans and America.’ That’s why it is nice today we have this Buddha Pūjā.<br /> May God bless you!</b>"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1988-0723 Śhrī Buddha Pūjā, Tent, YMCA Camp Surf, 560 Silver Strand Blvd, Imperial Beach (21 kms S of San Diego), CA, U.S.A.</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image104.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>"So there are three, three mantras of – in the Buddhist, the Buddhist religion, they call it, or Buddha’s stotram."</b></font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1990-0514 Śhrī Buddha Pūjā, Saint Petersburg, Russia</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkGreen">"So there are three, three mantras of – in the Buddhist, the Buddhist religion, they call it, or Buddha’s stotram. The first one is “Buddham sharanam gachami,” meaning “I surrender myself to all the people who are enlightened.” That case we have to respect each other. We are all enlightened souls. As I also bow to you, you have to bow to each other. So, we are to bow to all the people who are enlightened. And thus, we respect each other’s Self-realization.<br /> Now, there’s a way you could surely know about Namadeva. And he was a great poet, and a saint in Maharashtra. And this Namadeva went to see another realized soul who was a potter, potter, little pots. This – another one was called as Gura Khumar, Gura Khumar. Now the Namadeva thought that he was a seeker of a much higher state. So when he saw him, he was just mixing the clay with his feet. Though he stood absolutely stunned looking at Gura Khumar – Namadeva – for a minute and that just to touch his eyes and hands and bowed to him.<br /> And he said that, “I came to feel here to see something that is formless, just to feel the vibrations, but here, it’s the formless [which] is in the form.” This is the appreciation of one Sahaja Yogi of another one. It is appreciation. But many people, many people can though [throw?], other people who are not Sahaja yogis, but not Sahaja Yogis themselves. So, one has to know that all of you are now in such a condition that you are all great yogis, and you all have to be respected. And nobody has to preserve [thou?]."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1990-0514 Śhrī Buddha Pūjā, Saint Petersburg, Russia</b></font><br /> <b>Nirgunache Bheti</b><br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZpfZ6DBuQA">video</a></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image105.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="Indigo"><b>Buddham sharanam gachhāmi</b><br /> I surrender myself to my Self-realisation and to all those who are realised souls (Buddhas)<br /> <b>Dhammam sharanam gachhāmi</b><br /> I surrender myself to dharma, to the innate religion that is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma<br /> <b>Saṅgham sharanam gachhāmi</b><br /> I surrender myself to collectivity and to the collective community of realised souls<br /> <b>Shrī Ādi Shaktyai Nirmalā Mātaram sharanam gachhāmi</b><br /> I surrender myself to Shri Adi Shakti Mataji</font><br /> <font size="-1"><font color="DarkGreen"><b>Buddham Sharnam Gachami</b></font></font><br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IRvnyOjUdI">video</a></p><font size="+2"><b>Suggested Talk:</b></font> <font size="+0">1992-0531 Śhrī Buddha Pūjā, The Search for the Absolute, Śhuddhi Camp (now The Hall, Shudy Camps Park), Shudy Camps, Cambridgeshire, UK</font><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=Y4tpGZyIgoY"> video</a><br /></p><font size="+2"><b>Bhajans:</b></font><p> <font color="green"><b>Sandhanya ya Janmi Nirvan</b></font><br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KR3lFmFS19A"> video</a><br /></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Buddha Deva Tujhi Dnyan Ganga</b></font><br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNhahxAcSCU">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Maa Hai Ek.
