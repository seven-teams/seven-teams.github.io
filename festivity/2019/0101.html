So all that is not wanted should be thrown out of this temple and make yourself that clean, beautiful temple where God would like to reside, otherwise He'll disappear. And that is what is Ishwara Pranidhana (establishment of God in the heart) which we should try to maintain, establish and develop and then it grows and grows and grows, the temple becomes a palace; a huge, big place where many can come and enjoy the bliss of your heart. Let's become like that. <b>So today is a day of a pledge in a way in our hearts to say that whatever we do we do from our hearts.</b>"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1983-1121 Christmas Pūjā, Āśhram, 102 Ditton Road, Surbiton, London, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image57.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="MediumBlue">"<b>Mediation is very important after Sahaja Yoga.</b> You have slept and slept all your life.<br /> Sleeping is not so important.

Like I would say Indians are not very good with the money, in money matters they can be very horrid, and sometimes they create a problem with money matters: so, one has to know that we have to be absolutely astute as far as money is concerned.<br /> ......<br /> So, <b>the second oath we have to take before Shri Ganesha</b> is that, 'I will be honest to myself. I will not deceive myself for anybody’s sake.'<br /> Now the third great thing about Shri Ganesha is that, for Him no Gods exist except His Mother. And you know all the stories about Shri Ganesh, how He adored His Mother. Because He knows His Mother is the Power; and that He is the source of your wisdom, He’s the embodiment of wisdom, and the greatest wisdom He has: that it is better to worship the Mother than anybody else, because She is the Power. According to Him, even the Father, if you have to meet, you have to go through the Mother, and secondly Father is just the Witness. All His security, all His powers, all His beauty, Innocence, come from His Mother.<br /> So with <b>the third oath you have to take that</b>, `For us, our Mother is so powerful, why should we be afraid of anything? If She is going to give us the wisdom, why should we try to seek it anywhere else?'<br /> I appear very innocent sometimes, but My innocence is complete intelligence, I think. And that is the reason, you see, people take time to accept. But people like Shri Ganesha who are the wisest of all, ‘know’ the trick!<br /> <b>The another oath we have to take today that</b>, `We’ll respect every Sahaja Yogi from our heart, because they are made in the form of Shri Ganesha. We’ll not make fun of them, we’ll not laugh at them.' As long as they are in Sahaja Yoga we have to respect. But they can be thrown away, they can get out of it. But unless and until this happens, do not put your ego on other people. Don’t think that you understand everything. Don’t think that you know everything. Respect each and every person, not to what he has read or for what he has learnt, but because he is a great soul."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1984-0902 Śhrī Gaṇeśha Pūjā, Buffet Area, Hotel Riffelberg, Zermatt, Switzerland</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image59.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="FireBrick">"So then everybody should today decide and <b>take an oath</b> that we'll do everything to spread Sahaja Yoga with humility."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1992-1025 Diwālī Pūjā (Diwālī Day), Sala Olimpia (Olympia Sports Hall), Timişoara, Romania</b></font><br /></p><p> <font color="blue">"Sahaja Yogi: So it [UNCLEAR], should be little bit other than heart of Your children and the expression of the gratitude for Your protection, Your love, Your greatness and I don't know.

So if we are allowed to crown You, it means that we have to have complete adherence, allegiance and surrender. Otherwise how can we crown You? We are not even able to reach Your head because your head is reaching the Universe. So in our heart we have tried the songs, little poems, give some little things, Shri Mataji. And some pictures and photographs from You. And through this, whatever may be the quality Shri Mataji, I am sure that all of us will be able <b>to make this pledge of complete obedience, complete adherence, complete gratitude for You.
