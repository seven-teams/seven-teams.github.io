And they received their Self-realization individually, one by one. And the method for individual Realization was just the opposite of the collective. First they had to establish their dharma, cleanse themselves fully, desiring all the time for their salvation, putting their attention to their salvation, as you call it Īśhwarapraṇidhān [desire for God], thinking of God, asking for His Grace and acting in a scrupulous, dhārmik ways to keep themselves pure. They had to control their mind, control their desires, control their action in such a manner that they absolutely kept to the center path.

Even after their Self-realization, those who still indulge in their old habits, their state is known as ‘yogabhraṣhṭ’ [one who has fallen from the practice of Yoga].<br /> You should take out your attention from little-little things, just give them up. You should live like a great, fully satisfied personality, one who has to help, guide, support and provide awakening to thousands of people.<br /> The mantra of Sahasrāra is ‘Nirmalā’ which means everyone should be clean, tidy, pure and ‘niṣhkalaṅk’ [immaculate, without any blemish/stain].<br /> When the door to the Spirit opens, then there is no shortage of anything. The Mother opens this door. That is why She is dear to Śhrī Gaṇeśha. After which there is no need for anything else. When this state is achieved, then only the Self-realization is complete. Then you are completely absorbed into it and you feel completely blessed."</font><br /> <b>1900-0000 Four Quotes from Nirmala Yoga (Hindi), Issue 19 (May-June 1985), Page 15</b></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image150.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>Vish'weshwari twam paripasi vishwam</b><br /> O Queen of the universe You are its guardian.<br /> <b>Vish'atmika dharayas'iti vishwam</b><br /> In the form of the Universe You are its receptacle.<br /> <b>Vishw'esha vandhya bhavati bhavanti</b><br /> You are worshipped by the lords of the universe.<br /> <b>Vishw'ashraya ye twayi bhakti namraha</b><br /> Those who are devoted to You themselves become supporters of the universe</font><br /> <b>Prayer to Shri Raja-rajeshwari<br /> (79 names of Shri raja-rajeshwari created by Shri Mataji Herself and read out during the 2000 Sahasrara Puja in Cabella)</b><br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jLDenmw7So"> video</a></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"Sahasrara is your awareness. When it is enlightened you get into the technique of the Divine. Now there are two techniques: the technique of the Divine, and the technique that you follow. You cannot act as Divine, but you can use the Divine power and manoeuvre it. For example, Divine looks after all the Universal happenings.Every minutest particle is controlled by Divine. When your Sahasrara opens out and your Kundalini touches the fontanelle bone, sort of a igniting force is ready in your Sahastrara, and as soon as the fontanelle bone area opens up through the brahmarandhra, the Grace of your Spirit ignites that igniting force and your nadis get enlightened. Not all of them, quite a lot of them; not all the length, but quite the peripheries. That’s how you get your enlightenment."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1982-0505 Sahasrāra Pūjā, Opening the Primordial Sahasrāra, Āśhram, 9, Allée Du Rocher, Le Raincy (13 kms E of Paris), France</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image151.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>"When your Mother is the Deity of Sahasrāra,<br /> the only way to be able to keep the Sahasrāra open has to be complete surrendering."</b></font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1985-0504 Talk to Sahaja Yogis, Nirvikalpa, the day before Sahasrāra Pūjā, Laxenburg Castle, Vienna, Austria</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"We have so know that in our awareness we have to be conscious how far we have achieved the consciousness for our relationship with each other, that is the Collective Consciousness of Virāṭ, of the brain, that is of Sahasrāra. So in principle Sahasrāra is Viṣhṇu Tattwa, but the Deity is Śhrī Mātājī Nirmalā Devī. So you can see how the beautiful integration has taken place.<br /> All the Powers of Śhrī Viṣhṇu have to act according to the Deity, surrendered at the Lotus Feet of the Deity. So the consciousness of Śhrī Viṣhṇu is absolutely in the hands of the Deity. I do not want to talk about this tremendous Deity, it is too much, because it may fill you up with awe. So, whatever is working out, allow it to work out. They say, “Surrender your Sahasrāra to this Deity.” And it’s so, so simple for you, because you have the Deity, you have your own Sahasrāra, and it’s only you, the people who are Sahaja Yogis today in modern times, who have seen the Deity.<br /> They say that you have to ask for three things called ‘Sālokya’, ‘Sāmīpya’, ‘Sanīḍya [Sanīḍa]’ from God; meaning to see God ‘Sālokya’, ‘Sāmīpya’ – the closeness with God and ‘Sanīḍya [Sanīḍa]’ is the companionship of God. But you have got ‘Tādātmya’, which is Oneness with God, which is not in the concept of any one of the Yogis and the Saints and the Seers who have been before. And this ‘Tādātmya’ you have when you are outside My body, while they have this ‘Tādātmya’ when they are inside My body, when they are no more. So you should understand the time limit. You must understand your greatness and you must understand how you people are chosen for the highest work in this creation."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1986-0504 Sahasrāra Pūjā, 16th Sahasrāra Day (Consciousness, Evolution, and You Have to Jump into Nirvikalpa), Consorzio Alpe Motta, Via per Motta, 2, Madesimo (115 kms N of Como), Italy</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image152.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>Shri Mataji:</b> Now say the Sahasraras mantras, three, Sahasrara Swamini, Moksha Pradayani, Sahaja Yoga Dayini.</font><br /> <b>Sahaja Yogis: Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Sahasrara Swamini Moksha Pradayani Sakshat Shri Adishakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Namah.</b><br /> <font color="DarkRed"><b>Shri Mataji:</b> Sahaja Yoga Dayini.</font><br /> <b>Sahaja Yogis: Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Sahaja Yoga Dayini Sakshat Shri Adishakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Namah.</b><br /> <font color="DarkRed"><b>Shri Mataji:</b> Now after saying all these mantras you have reached up to Sahasrara and you have also pierced through the Sahasrara.<br /> The most effective mantra you know is Nirmala, and that works the best for Sahasrara.</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1980-0126 Pūjā, 31st Republic Day Celebration, Seminar, Day 1, Golwad (near Bordi), Maharashtra, India</b></font><br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPBwtVUOHKg"> video</a><br /></p><font size="+2"><b>Suggested Talk:</b></font> <font size="+0">1989-0506 Sahasrāra Pūjā, Sahaja Yoga Is Nothing but Is Love (Whole Power of Sahasrāra is Love and Jump in the Ocean of Love), Theater Cinema della Rosa, Via delle Rose, 35, Sorrento, Italy</font><p><a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html"> Part 1</a><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html"> Part 2</a><br /></p><font size="+2"><b>Bhajans:</b></font><p> <font color="green"><b>Jago Savera Aya Hai, Mata Ne Jagaya Ha</b></font><br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUNkxcIAEs4"> video</a><br /></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Vandan Karuya Matajila</b></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Anyatha Sharnam Naasti</b></font><br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX0Gy8VNh3E">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Jogawa</b></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Dhyana te rangale</b></font><br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0w8QSa7zNY4">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>O Queen of universe</b></font><br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y2Z3tNAs0I&amp;spfreload=5">video</a></p><p> <font size="+0">Jai Śhrī Mātājī!<br /> On behalf of the festivity team!</font></p></section><footer class="page__meta"></footer><nav class="pagination"> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/festivity/2019/0504" class="pagination--pager" title="2019 Celebrating Sahasrara Puja: Evening Program ">Previous</a> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/festivity/2019/0507" class="pagination--pager" title="2019 Akshaya Tritiya: “It is regarded as the most auspicious day to start anything” ">Next</a></nav></div></article></div><script src="https://seven-teams.github.io/assets/js/main.min.js"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', '', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script src="https://unpkg.com/vanilla-back-to-top@7.2.1/dist/vanilla-back-to-top.min.js"></script> <script>addBackToTop()</script></body></html>
