But's not true. Because any self-realized person, in the Sahaja Yoga, can raise the Kuṇḍalinī and king ... can give Self-realization to others, immediately after they have touched the Sahasrāra or opened the Sahasrāra. But normally a realized Soul cannot do it. Any born realized Soul cannot do it on its own: it has to have authority of Me, as I am today.<br /> That's why it was said that, ``Guru is a person who makes you meet God": he raises the Kuṇḍalinī and makes you one with God."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1979-0708 Guru Pūjā, Āśhram, 8, Hamilton Road, Dollis Hill, London NW10 1NX, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image1199.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>"It will work out on this Guru Pūrṇimā Day, it is a very auspicious day.
