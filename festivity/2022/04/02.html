I said about this day at [unclear]. <b>That first day [Guḍhī Pāḍavā] of these nine nights [of Vasant Navarātri], in this year, will start the manifestation of the New Age.</b><br /> Of course, the New Age has come long time back. But the manifestation did not work out that much. It will start, I’m sure.<br /> But I find that attitude of human beings towards any divine working is little strange. It has been very strange. If it was not – they never recognized Christ, they never recognized Rāma, they never recognized Kṛiṣhṇa. In the same way, they will never recognize also Satya Yuga, this New Age.<br /> When these people came, nobody bothered. Those who bothered were only bothered to see how they kill or torture Them. Nobody could see through Their principles, through Their lives, Their power, that, ‘There is something great in these Incarnations, and we must make use of it.’<br /> The reason is: man has these old ways of great ignorance."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1978-0408 Public Program (Guḍhī Pāḍavā Day), Satya Yuga, Caxton Hall, 10 Caxton Street, Westminster, London, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image929.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>"So today I wish you happy New Year for a journey in the spiritual life of this world."</b></font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1976-0330 Guḍhī Pāḍavā Pūjā (the day before Guḍhī Pāḍavā), We Have to Be in Meditation Meditation (Be in Thoughtless Awareness and Meditation Is Where You Are No More), New Delhi, India</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"I was telling them that after the introduction of this calendar the Śhālivāhan King founded his kingdom and lived there from the day of the Guḍhī Pāḍavā [Guḍhī is a symbol of auspiciousness]. Since you know all this I did not tell you and explained to them in English.<br /> With respect to the Guḍhī Pāḍavā the shawl has great significance. The Śhālivāhan Kings always carried the Goddess’s shawl with them. You know the significance of Devī’s shawl. You know it gives Her beauty. With the shawl, She protects Herself from cold and wind. Also with it She protects Her chastity, as well as if any dirt is about to touch Her body it is prevented. So, a shawl which is offered to Goddess symbolizes Her protection, meaning ‘since You protect us we offer You this.’ Further, if the children are sleeping or are sick or have a problem, then She covers them with the shawl. So shawl is very important.<br /> You know, in the past it was a practice with all people in Maharashtra to take [put a] shawl over their bodies.

Gaurī who created Gaṇapati is the Gaurī from Chaitra and we all believe that.<br /> In the same way, our Śhālivāhans have given it so much importance that Guḍhī Pāḍavā starts on the first day of Chaitra month, because Gaurī first is Śhakti, who started the work, to start any work first we worship Gaṇeśha, this is also done by Gaurī.</b><br /> Gaurī has put Gaṇeśh in the temporal world or universe so that the innocence which Gaṇeśh has should spread in the whole world. And before anyone else, She established Chaitanya in the form of Gaṇeśh for the whole world and spread it everywhere. Then we will do whatever is required but first is the Spirit, the Chaitanya. The world’s Kuṇḍalinī, Mother Gaurī has done this work.<br /> The importance of this day is that this is the beginning, creating Śhrī Gaṇeśh on Her on own, no contribution from Sadāśhiv, She has not yet met Sadāśhiv, so the Virgin Gaurī, She created Gaṇapati from Her Powers, because She is Śhakti Swarūpa, She can do anything.

But whatever is the reason is as per worldly beliefs.<br /> The other thing is that, in Śhālivāhana dynasty, there was one person Babhruvāhana. He defeated King Vikramāditya. After that, he started this new calendar called Śhālivāhana Calendar. As per that from today, today is the first day. Its importance is more in Maharashtra.<br /> <b>To represent Śhālivāhana, they take kumbh [round water pot] and in that a shawl – he was Śhālivāhana.<br /> Kumbh represents Kuṇḍalinī. They tie a shawl and keep a Kumbh on top. The meaning of that is Kumbh also represents spirituality. Spirituality is represented by the Kumbh.<br /> Śhālivāhana used to call themselves seven vehicles. They had a lot of faith in Kuṇḍalinī. Later they started giving shawl to Devī.
