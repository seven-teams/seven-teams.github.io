Salutations to You!</p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>In Sahaj we very much respect and understand Mahāvīrjī and we also accept that He is the Incarnation of Śhrī Bhairavnāth and not only this he took birth many times and later also came as Hasan and Husayn.</b><br /> In Bible, Bhiaravnāthjī is addressed as Saint George and some refer him as Saint Michael. It is very surprising that London which we understand as Heart has Saint George as its angel. That is! They accept Bhairavnāth so it’s correct. Because if Śhivjī resides in heart then having Bhairavnāth is important. There are so many things which if we read with understanding then they are all interconnected and how is their relation automatically established. In Sahaj Śhakti you get overwhelmed and you enjoy it and this makes Me happy. God has created this universe for you so you should enjoy it, what else do you want. In you, there are many powers and you use them and you have also shared it with others. In this way, the family of our Sahaj should grow. We should save as many possible, most important our children. We should take care of them because a wrong type of culture has started and the children are getting affected. So we should pay attention to it and to them and take care of them. When they are established in Sahaj then they will not go around."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1993-0404 Śhrī Mahāvīra Jayanti Pūjā (Hindi), New Delhi, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image945.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">So we have to thank really very much Mahāvīra, who has given us this power to remove our left-sided problems, who has given us this light in our hand, which He Himself vibrates and He Himself tries to throw some light on the obscure things about Me also. Because of Him only, we can get cured of so many physical and mental troubles.<br /> <b>You know that the left side can be easily cured if you use three-candle treatment. That shows Mahāvīra is only fond of light. He doesn't like darkness</b> and His idea is, I think that way, is to now fully go all the way to clear the left side as far as possible, to help Sahaja Yoga to establish in countries where I find still lot of this negativity is there -- a lot of it. </font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>991-0328 Śhrī Mahāvīra Pūjā, Left Side and Soul, Gidgegannup, Darling Ranges (45 kms NE of Perth), WA, Australia</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"The ascetic life of Mahāvīra was of a very, very extreme nature. He was the one who was born in a ... uh ... clan of warriors, Kṣhatriyas. And then He was also married, also He had a daughter. And then He decided, because He knew He had to do the work of the Divine, He decided to take a saṃnyāsa. So He took uh the permission of His brother because His parents were dead. He was a king, so He gave up all His uh material wealth, everything and He beg ... became a complete saṃnyāsī. And the He left His family, His left His ... house, everything behind and went alone with a little bowl for begging alms. And there people who joined Him were very few, and He asked them that, ``You have to also become ascetics," Munis.<br /> He was a Reincarnation of Saint Michael and He resides on the left side, on the Iḍā nāḍī. And He looks after the whole of it, right from Mūlādhāra onwards up to the Sahasrāra. <b>So Saint Michael was born as Mahāvīra, meaning The Greatest Warrior. But when He was born, the whole place got lot of uh prosperity, that's why He was called as Vardhamān, to begin with.</b><br /> But His asceticism was there because of the Brahminism that was so prevalent in those days, and people were absolutely drowned into it.
