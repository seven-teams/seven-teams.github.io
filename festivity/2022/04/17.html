You were all in the knowledge that there is something higher that has to happen, that you have to be born-again. But, nobody knew how it works?<br /> The subtle side of your being was never told to you. The Saints only talked as to how you should behave. They only said how you should try to keep a very pure life, sincere life but they didn’t tell you how it will work out. Of course, people knew in India about it, very few of them, very very few. But, now it’s a worldwide knowledge through you people.<br /> <b>Now when your Kuṇḍalinī rises, She is your mother, She is your individual mother and She gives you the Second Birth.

It is very significant and symbolic that in Sahaja Yoga, also what we have done, is to rise from the dead into life. It is to be understood that Resurrection is the message for all of us, for the whole world. We have to resurrect ourselves. There was no need for Jesus to do that. But He was a model: model of a Saint, model of a realized Soul, model of a person who came all the way from the Heavens to save us.<br /> So this Resurrection is also part and parcel of our lives. It is so symbolic, so very symbolic, that we were, in our consciousness, lost people. We had no control over ourselves as to know the way our mind told us to go.<br /> ...... <b>He knew when the Resurrection takes place, the Kuṇḍalinī rises and connects you to the Divine Power, which is all-pervading. Then you start understanding that there’s a life beyond the life that you have made.

The Spirit that is Christ has to resurrect out of the material manifestation of the Divine Itself. The matter is manifested because we ourselves have created it. Not that we are born out of matter, our body, but we are attached to it, we want it, we want to have it. Whatever you want, that sustains itself, by your desire, because now you are on the stage. If you want to sustain the matter, if you want to keep the matter as the first priority, it will remain. It cannot disappear. It has to go out of your mind that matter cannot hold you any further.<br /> Christ rose out of the matter, came out of the tomb which symbolizes the matter which has enclosed us within, which has to be opened out with our spiritual power.

In the ‘Devī Māhātmyam, if you read that, He was created as Mahāviṣhṇu and is mentioned very clearly that first He was created as an egg. It is written in this book, which perhaps was written about fourteen thousand years back. It’s a book that predicts about Christ and that is why people, in the West specially, offer an egg to each other as a friend. So, first the existence came on this Earth as an egg, that was Christ, and part of it was kept in that stage and the rest of it was used by the Holy Ghost, by Mahālakṣhmī, to create Christ out of it.<br /> In that ancient book He was called as Mahāviṣhṇu: means the Greater Form of Viṣhṇu. But actually Viṣhṇu is the Father and He is the Son created by the Holy Ghost.<br /> After My lecture, I would like, if you have the book, to read it out to them the whole text of how Christ was created.<br /> And when He was created, He cried for His Father, as He cried also on the cross once. And He cried for years. And then <b>Christ, in Mahāviṣhṇu State, was blessed by His Father, who said that “Your position will be placed higher than Mine and You will be the Ādhāra,” means the Support of the Universe.</b> See, how from Mūlādhāra He becomes the Ādhāra. This was all done at the heavenly stage, Vaikuṇṭha Stage you can say.<br /> Then He was given birth by the Holy Ghost who was the Mother of Christ on this Earth, who was nobody else but was the Incarnation of Mahālakṣhmī, means She was Rādhā. Rā-dhā. Rā means energy, dhā means the one who sustains energy."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1982-0411 Easter Pūjā, How Christ Was Created, Resurrection of Christ, and Collective Resurrection (Mahāviṣhṇu State, Easter Is the Most Important Happening, You are a Collective Being and Collectivity Is the Nature of a Sahaja Yogi), Nirmala Palace Āśhram, 99 Nightingale Lane, Balham, London SW12 8LZ, UK</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>The Redeemer was necessary, that's why Christ was established here, who was Rādhā's Son.</b><br /> You would be surprised that Mary Herself was Rādhā. There is a reason for this, a great reason.<br /> Sītājī was Śhrī Rāma's wife. Was married. The injustice that was done to Her by the society, made Her leave the house, by accusing Her falsely, disgraced Her. Why back then these great people had a blindfold on? Why didn't they say, that, `She is our Mother? You are asking Her to leave the house?' She already had passed the test, bypassing the fire, why were they dumbfounded then? What happened to their vigor [light] back then? All were so-called very great then. Nobody raised any point on that.<br /> To teach them a lesson Rādhājī did not marry Kṛiṣhṇa under the societal norms. But still, the whole world knows Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa as Rādhā-Kṛiṣhṇa. But for Him, the formal marriage is important, that's why there was no child.<br /> But in the next life, She came as Mary and Her Child glorified Her, who was a virgin."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1973-1208 Public Program (Hindi), Day 2, Biralā Krīṛā Keṃdra, Chowpatty, Girgaum Chowpatty, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image957.png" /></div><p style="color:DarkGreen; text-align:center;"> <b>Ādhi vyādhi maranā varati </b><br /> All the diseases and problems get completely dissolved<br /> <b>Pāy. ashā purushāchā re </b><br /> Where the Feet of God reside<br /> <b>Bhaya kāy. tayā prabhu jyātzā re</b><br /> When we belong to God, what is there to fear?<br /> <a href="https://youtu.be/47fMsue7fs8">video</a></p><font size="+2"><b>Suggested Talk:</b></font> <font size="+0"><b>2001-0422 Easter Pūjā, You Cannot Resurrect Yourself Without Controlling Āgñyā, Tent, Campsite (3 kms from Hotel Demirkoy), Istanbul, Turkey</b></font><p><a href="https://vimeo.com/107104684"> video</a><br /></p><font size="+2"><b>Bhajans:</b></font><p> <font color="green"><b>Gajānana Śhrī Gaṇarāyā</b></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Maranache mela</b></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Śhrī Mahālakṣhmī Stotram</b></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="green"><b>Eka Gaṇapati Eka Īsā</b></font><br /> <a href="https://youtu.be/Dg41OjGhrU8">video</a></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image958.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"Christ came on this Earth to say that we have to seek our Spirit. <b>The message of His life is His Resurrection.
