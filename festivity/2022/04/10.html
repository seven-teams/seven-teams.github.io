Śhrī Rāma has taken the place of father hence if there is lack in the responsibility or love from father this chakra is caught. In Sahaja Yoga, we to understand that Śhrī Rāma and all other Deities have taken the form to fulfill their divine work, in all Śhrī Rāma had a special task. As it was said by Socrates that the Benevolent King has to come the same way Śhrī Rāma had come on this Earth as benevolent king, He came in the form of human being, He even forgot that He was Incarnation of Śhrī Viṣhṇu, forgot about Him but for all world, <b>He was Puruṣhottama Rāma</b>."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1991-0325 Śhrī Rāma Pūjā (Hindi) (the day after Rām Navamī Day), If You Believe in Śhrī Rāma Follow His Ideal (Our Nature Can Change because He Is Our Ideal and You All Become Ideals for this World), Kolkata, West Bengal, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image939.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="Blue"><b>Auṃ Twameva sākṣhāt Śhrī Puruṣhottama sākṣhāt Śhrī Ādi Śhakti Mātājī Śhrī Nirmalā Devī namo namaḥ!</b></font><br /> <font size="+0"><b> The highest among the Puruṣhas (ideal human beings)</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"Today is Rām Navamī. I should say it was not started, we should say, but it was very much in vogue when Rāma lived and they used to do Yagñyas at that time. The reason was, that the people had just started realizing that “there is something higher and you have to worship that higher Self,” the Seers said, and they thought that the best thing is to do Yagñyas. The same thing.<br /> On the left side, of course, the people started the worship of God and the dedication to God and all those things. That is ‘bhakti’ [devotion]. But mainly what they did before Rāma was the Yagñyas, the Vedas, with which they prayed to different elements. Elements have made our chakras, and they tried to evoke the Deities of the Elements. But actually it amounts to the same [thing].<br /> So, as a child, Rāma was studying with a very great Saint, and when he was studying with him, Vasiṣhṭha was the name of the great Saint. And Vasiṣhṭha had an āśhram where Rāma and His brothers studied."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1982-0402 Śhrī Rāma Pūjā, Rāma Navamī, Āśhram, 44 Chelsham Road, London, Clapham, UK</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"...... the story of Rāma they say was written before He was born.

So, with all that, with born out of the blessings of the Agni, that is fire, and also was born in the dynasty of Sūrya, He was one of the mildest Avatāras you have ever had.

If you have said, “I will do this,” you must do it. You should not find out excuses to avoid it. It’s absolutely an anti-God activity to avoid doing things that you have promised. Your Deities will never be happy. You must see that, whatever you have promised you must do."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1982-0402 Śhrī Rāma Pūjā, Rāma Navamī, Āśhram, 44 Chelsham Road, London, Clapham, UK</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"And this is another quality of Śhrī Rāma, is a saṅkoch. There’s no word in English language because you have ‘formality’ which is a very insipid word to describe saṅkoch. Because, there is no integration between your heart and formality.<br /> ...... So that saṅkocha, that understanding comes if you love someone and understand. Now, you have to love all the seekers of the world. They have done wrong, they have done all kinds of ego trips, they have done all kinds of mistakes but your Mother loves them and you have to love them. If they are to be corrected I’ll do that. You just don’t do that way that they feel hurt. Put a saṅkocha. While talking to each other educate yourself, train yourself to say things which are sweet and nice, which will make another person feel that this person is a properly brought up person in Sahaja Yoga tradition. So we have a Sahaja Yoga tradition also, in which, when we speak to each other, we have that saṅkocha within us of Śhrī Rāma.

But if they do not, there will be a third world war and the effects of that will harm people so much that ultimately it is the Sahaja Yogis who will be called for a conference and not the diplomats. The Sahaja Yogis will be consulted, and they will decide what is to be done for the world and they will become the rulers of tomorrow’s world.
