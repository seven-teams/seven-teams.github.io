Because He was very much hurt to see three types of problems from which human beings suffer. And He came to [the] conclusion: ‘All these three types of problems are because we have desires.’ So He said that, “If you become desireless, then there will be no problem for you.”<br /> So He studied Vedas, He studied Upaniṣhadas, He studies [studied] all kinds of things, He went to many Saints and many people, [but] He could not get His Realization.<br /> Actually, He was an Incarnation. The Incarnation also has to reach a point of Realization in a different way. Like the whole potential has to open out. But the Incarnation has tremendous potential.

That time, especially in India, we had two types of people: one, who were very ritualistic, trying to be extremely strict and disciplined; and the another were the people who were too much conditioned and were full of so-called devotion to God. So these two types of people were occupying the area of seekers. So it was necessary to neutralize these two styles of seekings.

But there was no need for anybody else to take saṃnyāsa. But in His case mistakes, I mean, why there were some mistakes about things, because when He tried all these tricks of saṃnyāsa, going here and there He never realized that this is all not needed. He was so tired and fagged out, that suddenly, spontaneous, the Primordial Mother Herself gave Him the Realization because He was so tired."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1979-0611 Public Program, How Aspects of God Are Expressed within Us, Caxton Hall, 10 Caxton Street, Westminster, London, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image977.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>"The Pūjā to Shrī Buddha is being performed today to open this chakra.<br /> At the level of the Āgñyā chakra, there are thoughts.

The problem with Sahaja Yogis sometimes is that they don’t know the importance of what they are, they are not aware. If their ego was correct, in that ahaṅkāra, ego, the essence of it is aham-bhāva, is that, ‘I am a Sahaja Yogi.’ I am a Sahaja Yogi.’ Now keep the point of honesty with it. ‘Honestly, I’m a Sahaja Yogi and I’m a follower of a religion, which is a Universal Religion, which is innately built myself. There’s no hanky panky about it. Is my experience, and I believe in it fully, and is innately within myself.’ This is the aham-bhāva. I don’t know what is it in the English language, is could be ‘I’-ness, ‘I’-ness.<br /> Then, “I am on this Earth now, this life is for the work of God. And for that, I have to be a pure person because I belong to Vishwa Nirmal Dharm. I have to be pure. I have to achieve my purity: through meditation through every way watching myself, ‘I have to be a pure person.’ And if I am a Sahaja Yogi, if I am united with that All-pervading Power of Love, I should be the medium to give that love to others and compassion. I have no time for other things. Other things are of no value. My attention has to be pure. My life has to be pure."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1989-0520 Śhrī Buddha Pūjā, Gautama, The Lord of the Ego, Open Air near El Farell Hotel, Barcelona, Spain</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>So, this special thing is that we are worshiping a Deity on the right Āgñyā which makes you think too much, first of all, and also it makes you aggressive, and also it makes you a very right-sided.</b> By this worship, you will become very mild, very gentle, very beautiful people and you’ll be able to see things much more clearly.<br /> Now, this right side gives you a kind of a ego which troubles everyone, but you could never feel the trouble till you get into a very serious state. It gives you the overactivity of the brain and conscious mind works too hard. For that you are, you are not very hard-working people, but you can see, first of all, that your mind is more active than your body.
