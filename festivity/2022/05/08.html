Every one of you have got it. Also all over the world, you have many people who have got their Sahasrāras open. Of course, we need many more for them to understand what is this great event of such a collective opening of Sahasrāra.<br /> Some have grown very much, after getting their Realization, very much. They have understood Sahaja Yoga very well, and they have developed their depth, and their consciousness is really a great awareness of Oneness with the Divine.<br /> <b>To be one with the Divine is the greatest blessing for human beings.</b>"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>2002-0505 Sahasrāra Pūjā, Watch Yourself, Hangar (now Nirmal Temple), Albera Ligure, Alessandria, Italy</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image970.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>"Sahasrāra is the day which is very important, which makes a big history in the spirituality and also in the evolutionary process."</b></font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1988-0730 Talk to Sahaja Yogis, Divine Laws, after the Evening Program, the day before Guru Pūjā, Tent, Grounds around Annapurna Atiram Aparthotel, Pont d'Ansalonga, Ansalonga, Andorra</b></font><br /> <br /> <font color="DarkRed"><b>Tū Ādi Śhakti, Sahasrār viraji</b><br /> You are Śhrī Ādi Śhakti seated on the cosmic Sahasrāra</font><br /> <font color="DarkRed"><b>Chaitanya lutati, Satya Yuga jagati</b><br /> Showering Divine Vibrations and heralding the beginning of Satya Yuga</font><br /> <font color="DarkRed"><b>Viśhwa ki Janani, Tū Mahādevī</b><br /> You are the Mother of the universe and the Great Goddess</font><br /> <font color="DarkRed"><b>Tere Putra banne ki Patrata de Mā</b><br /> Mother please grant us all the qualities by which we can be Your children in reality.</font><br /> <font color="DarkRed"><b>He Nirmalā Mā, He Nirmalā Mā<br /> Tera pyar.

But we don’t know what She works, how She works, what happens to us. She rises in six centers and breaks the seventh ... I should say She breaks the sixth center because Gaṇeśha’s center doesn’t play any role. So when She breaks the sixth center, which is the Sahasrāra, then She connects you to the All-pervading Power of Divine Love.<br /> But what is this Divine Love? What does this do? It is the Energy of the Mother. We can say it is the Energy of Ādi Śhakti, which is all over, works through vibrations. But what are these vibrations? It’s a very subtle energy that starts flowing through your Sahasrāra. All the thousand petals of the Sahasrāra get slowly enlightened and it starts flowing throughout your body, throughout your hands, feet, throughout your body. And the more you are ... I mean your attention is, on the Sahasrāra, the more it works faster."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>2001-0506 Sahasrāra Pūjā, Hangar (now Nirmal Temple), Albera Ligure, Alessandria, Italy</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image971.png" /></div><p style=" text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>Viśhveśhwarī twam paripasi viśhwam</b><br /> O Queen of the universe You are its guardian.<br /> <b>Viśhwātmā dharayas'iti vishwam</b><br /> In the form of the Universe You are its receptacle.<br /> <b>Viśhweśha vandhya bhavati bhavanti</b><br /> You are worshipped by the lords of the universe.<br /> <b>Viśhwaśhraya ye twayi bhakti namraha</b><br /> Those who are devoted to You themselves become supporters of the universe</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>Prayer to Śhrī Rājarājeśhwarī.<br /> (79 names of Śhrī Rājarājeśhwarī created by Śhrī Mātājī Herself and read out during the 2000 Sahasrāra Pūjā in Albera Ligure)</b></font><br /> <a href="https://youtu.be/7jLDenmw7So">video</a></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today, it’s a great day because Sahasrāra Day and Mother’s Day have come together.

They tried everything, whatever way They thought was good for a particular community, particular area, particular country.
