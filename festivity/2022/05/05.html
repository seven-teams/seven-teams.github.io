And the method for individual Realization was just the opposite of the collective. First, they had to establish their dharma, cleanse themselves fully, desiring all the time for their salvation, putting their attention to their salvation, as you call it Īśhwarapraṇidhān [desire for God], thinking of God, asking for His Grace and acting in a scrupulous, dhārmik ways to keep themselves pure. They had to control their mind, control their desires, control their action in such a manner that they absolutely kept to the center path. And when they could get through all that testing and immunity, I mean they deserved, then only the Grace of Mother gave them Realization."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1980-0505 Sahasrāra Pūjā, Sincerity is the Key of Your Success, Āśhram, 8, Hamilton Road, Dollis Hill, London NW10 1NX, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image965.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>When we enter into the Realm of Sahasrāra, then only we have right to do the Sahasrāra Pūjā.</b><br /> Before this nobody talked about Sahasrāra, nobody did any Pūjā to Sahasrār.<br /> This is your privilege that you are in the Realm of Sahasrāra and that you can do this Pūjā, perform it, is your right, you are chosen for this.<br /> It’s a very privileged place for you to enter into the Sahasrāra of the Virāṭ, to reside in the brain as cells of that Sahasrāra."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1985-0505 Sahasrāra Pūjā, State of Absolute (Nirānanda Absolute Joy, Absolute Love, Absolute Compassion, Absolute Power), Laxenburg Castle, Vienna, Austria</b></font></p><p> <font color="red">"<b>It's a great day for all of us, the seekers, that the last work of the Divine, of opening the last center in the Great Primordial Being, was done on the fifth of May 1970. It is the greatest event of all the spiritual happenings of the Universe.</b> It was done with very great care and great adjustments.<br /> It is not in the limits of human understanding, how things are worked in the heavens. It is your fortune and God's Love that has worked out this wondrous miracle. Without this happening, there could not have been a possibility to give [en] masse Realization to people. One could have done it for one or two persons here and there, but to give such a masse awakening could not have been possible.<br /> As you know, in the Sahasrāra there are the seats of the seven main chakras. There are 1,000 nāḍīs or, as they call it, flames, and they all have each Sixteen Thousand Powers. Every nāḍī deals with a particular type of a person and, with the permutations and combinations of all these nāḍīs, human beings are looked after.<br /> As soon as Sahasrāra was opened, the whole atmosphere was filled with tremendous Chaitanya [vibrations]. And there was tremendous light in the sky. And the whole thing came on this Earth as if a torrential rain, or a waterfall, with such a tremendous force, as if I was unaware and got stupefied. The happening was so unexpected and so tremendous that I was stunned and I became completely silent at its grandeur. I saw the Primordial Kuṇḍalinī rising like a big furnace. And the furnace was very silent but burning uh appearance it had. As if you heat up some metal and it has many colors, in the same way, the Kuṇḍalinī showed up like a huge furnace, say of a, you can say, of a furnace which is like a tunnel, where you see these plants you have for uh coal burning to create electricity. And it stretched like a telescope one after another, it came out, tchue, tchue, tchue, like that. And the Deities came and sat on their Seats, on their Golden Seats, and then They lifted the whole of the head, like a big dome, and opened it. And then this torrential rain completely drenched Me, and I started seeing all that and got lost into the joy. It was like an artist seeing its own creation fulfilled, I felt the joy of great fulfillment."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1982-0505 Sahasrāra Pūjā, Opening the Primordial Sahasrāra, Āśhram, 9, Allée Du Rocher, Le Raincy (13 kms E of Paris), France</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image966.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"When the seventh chakra was opened, all the chakras came to your Sahasrāra, and so I could manage all your chakras and all your Deities.<br /> Any Deity you ask and you get the vibrations.<br /> <b>So that proves that I am the Brahmachaitanya.<br /> The Brahmachaitanya is the Ādi Śhakti and Sadāśhiva is also in My heart.</b><br /> But since I am so much humanized, it is not so easy to find it out.

Then your Sahasrāras could be opened out</b>, that’s why. And then I felt that: a tremendous flow of My Grace started flowing. So much Grace even upon Me, My own face, like torrential rain, you see, on Me. Absolutely I was so drenched in that joy, really I was lost, absolutely lost. Sort of I felt that the whole creation is now resounded with that Universal Consciousness, just like that. Everything was finished, only the joy was permeating. It was such a beautiful time.

What you call in Sanskrit is bhrānti. Illusions have vanished. You should have no illusion as to the existence of God Almighty, the Power of His Will and the Truth about Sahaja Yoga. You should have no doubts at all! Minimum of minimum should be like that.<br /> But while using this Power, you should be aware that this Power is given to you because you are capable of handling it. This is the Highest Power that you could think of.<br /> Take any governor, take any minister, anyone, they can be removed tomorrow. They can become corrupt. They can become absolutely devoid of any knowledge of their own powers. There are many people who just get elected without knowing what they have to do.<br /> <b>So this is not just a conversion of people, is not only even transformation, but it is a new fashioning of a new human being which has come forward and which is capable of carrying the Will of God further.</b><br /> So, as a result of your Realization, what you have got?<br /> The first thing that has happened is that your illusions have gone. You should have no illusions about God Almighty, His Will, and that He is omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient. All His omnipotence has done this work.<br /> And, as Collective Consciousness, you should also know that you are also omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient. Omniscient is the thing, that He sees everything, knows everything. Part of it, that Power, is also within you. So, to prove His omnipresence, you have to be all the time aware that you are Sahaja Yogis.<br /> So the Omnipotent God who is everywhere, who has done all this, the Will of God that has worked it out, has to work through you people. And you have to be very strong, very sensible, very wise, also very effective people. The more effective you become the more energy you'll get.<br /> But still I feel that the Sahaja Yogis are more, not taking the responsibility of understanding that they have to represent this God Almighty who is omnipresent, omniscient, who knows everything, who sees everything and who is potent, means Almighty.<br /> If you understand that this is what has happened after opening the Sahasrāra, that you have now got the Power which has these three qualities in it."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1992-0510 Sahasrāra Pūjā, The Will of God, Tent, Cabella Ligure, Alessandria, Italy</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>Sahasrāra is your awareness. When it is enlightened you get into the technique of the Divine.</b><br /> Now there are two techniques: the technique of the Divine, and the technique that you follow. You cannot act as Divine, but you can use the Divine Power and maneuver it.<br /> For example, Divine looks after all the universal happenings. Every minutest particle is controlled by Divine.<br /> When your Sahasrāra opens out and your Kuṇḍalinī touches the fontanel bone, sort of a igniting force is ready in your Sahasrāra, and as soon as the fontanel bone area opens up through the Brahmarandhra, the Grace of your Spirit ignites that igniting force and your nāḍīs get enlightened. Not all of them, quite a lot of them; not all the length, but quite the peripheries. That's how you get your enlightenment."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1982-0505 Sahasrāra Pūjā, Opening the Primordial Sahasrāra, Āśhram, 9, Allée Du Rocher, Le Raincy (13 kms E of Paris), France</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image968.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Dhyan.
