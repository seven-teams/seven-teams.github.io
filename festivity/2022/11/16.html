For the first time it has been advertised in so many papers and by different means.<br /> Guru Nāṇaka always talked of Sahaja Yoga. ``Everything else," He said, ``is just showing off." About religion He said that, "Observing fasts, going on pilgrimage, etc., are just meant to show off. Now you have to discover the power that is within you and establish it." Guru Nāṇaka kept on repeating the same thing again and again.<br /> ......<br /> But Guru Nāṇaka always talked of the Spirit. He explained it very clearly, but no one heeded what he wrote. They will just put a finger on the couplet and read it out. Could we understand him this way? If we go through his writings properly and absorb it, then the whole śhabda jālam [web of words], in which most of the people are caught, will come to an end. See the condition of Sikhs!<br /> Without looking within and experiencing the innate energy, how could one follow Sikh religion? Only this is the teaching of Guru Nāṇaka, this is what is called `Sikh' [learning]. All the Saints of that age had the discretion to know who is a Saint and who is not. All the gurus incorporated their poems and experiences in Guru Grantha and that is why Guru Grantha is revered so much. Only the renowned gurus contributed to it. They were so spiritual that they did churning of all the religious Scriptures and put the substance in Guru Grantha.<br /> That is what we do in Sahaja Yoga. <b>We do not follow any particular Saint or Incarnation; we respect all of them and strike a balance.</b>"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1999-1123 Śhrī Guru Nāṇaka Jayanti (Hindi), House, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image1080.png" /></div><p style="color:DarkRed; text-align:center;"> <b><b>Ikoaŉkār saṯ nām karṯā purakẖ nirbẖao nirvair akāl mūraṯ ajūnī saibẖaŉ gur parsāḏ.</b><br /> There is One and only One God who is transcendent as well as immanent.<br /> True and Eternal Name.
