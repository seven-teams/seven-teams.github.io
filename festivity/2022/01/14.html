And the area through which it has passed it has created different beautiful manifestation of the motherhood qualities on this Earth. We celebrate this change because the Sun has now moved into the new dimension so that all over the world there will be the warmth of the Sun.<br /> Warmth of the Sun represents the warmth of God's Love. This is the reason why we celebrate this festival by giving you some sort of a sweet made out of sesame seeds. Sesame seeds are given because they are also heat-giving and now as we are coming from the cold, we come to the hot season in a way, hotter season, so to prepare you with that warmth of the Sun these special things are made out of the seed of sesame to represent the oncoming warmth and the warm of the Sun.

It’s an energy, we can call it axis as the energy, moves the lava into different directions and pierces through different areas to create earthquakes, and also to have ... volcanoes, volcanoes. And all these things happen because the axis has sense what is to be done. This axis is the one that loves us.<br /> Because of this axis we, we have seasons. The seasons are created beautifully to give us different, different varieties of food and varieties of things. The heat of the Mother Earth if it is lost, then we’ll have nothing on this Earth, it’ll be all frozen and there will be all snow, and we’ll have no food, nothing, and it will be like Moon living here.

Now when you come for My Pūjā and all that I do expand it, I agree, but it is temporary thing. To retain it at that point one has to work at home, in the collective also. One has to work very much at home with meditation. But it should be done seriously. It should not be just a joke, to be frivolous, to be stupid – that’s not the way. It should be done very seriously, in the meaning that it is a devoted task you have taken, it’s a meditative thing; it’s a prayer to God we can call it, it’s a Pūjā to God. Is to be done with that reverence, because reverence is the key of achievement.

So today being the coldest day they want to give sesame seed, also want you to retain the heat and to adjust yourself to the heat that's coming up. This is all thought of in a way, in a very gross level, on a very gross level, that we should keep the people warm enough. Also it is said that the warmth of love should be expressed at this time for people, because it is the coldest day. So they say that, "We give you this special thing for you to say something sweet," that is, "Gūḷ gūḷ bola," means: "You say something sweet to us."
