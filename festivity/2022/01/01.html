That you have to get out of the bondages of ego. That you have to become absolutely a free glorious personality.

And once you are fed up with the falsehood, and also with the hypocrisy of people, you start seeking the Truth within. That’s how a new category of people are born, who are called as seekers – sādhakas. They are very different from others. They don’t care for any material gain or any power, position.

First She establishes our dharma by which we become righteous, we become religious in the real sense. After the light of Realization, we cannot do anything that is not dharma. As you know what is dharma is, and the maryādās, the boundaries of our behavior. This transformation takes place automatically. I don’t have to tell you, “Don’t do this, don’t do this,” like Ten Commandments. You, yourself, establish your dharma and you enjoy your virtues. This happens, as you know – already has happened to all of you – with the Grace of Mahālakṣhmī.

They never think that a new year is coming and what new thing we must think of. Whatever has been going on, it goes on day after day.<br /> In Sahaja Yoga when we are so collective, then we must think what new thing we must have in Sahaja Yoga. You have gone quite deep in meditation. You understand meditation and you have also established a certain state. But in a new year what new aspect you should take, we must put out attention towards this. We must think what are the problems of our country and also the problems of the world, and how can we solve them.
