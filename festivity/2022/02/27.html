I’ve already told about the reflection.<br /> Sadāśhiva is the God Almighty, the One who sees the play of Ādi Śhakti. But He is the Father who is watching each one of His Creation or Her Creation.<br /> His support to Ādi Śhakti is entirely, fully, strengthening. There’s no doubt in His mind about the capability of the Ādi Śhakti. But when He finds that in the play of Ādi Śhakti, the people of the world as such, try to disturb Her or spoil Her work, then He gets into His wrathful mood, and He destroys all such people, and maybe, He destroys the whole world.<br /> On one side He’s wrathful, no doubt, on the other side, He is the Ocean of Compassion and Joy. That’s why, when He’s reflected within us, we get our Self-realization, we get the light of our Spirit, and we get into the Ocean of Joy."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1996-0303 Śhivarātri Pūjā, Motivate Your Attention or God's Realization, Bundilla Scout Camp, 6 Baden Powell Pl, Winston Hills (35 kms E of Sydney), New South Wales, Australia</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image902.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>"Tonight we have gathered here to do Śhrī Śhiva Pūjā.

The ultimate aim of human beings is to attain that Śhiva Tattwa.</b> Śhiva Tattwa is beyond the brain. It cannot be known through the brain. Till you have got your Self-realization you cannot know the Self, Ātmā or the Śhiva Tattwa.<br /> Too much falsehood, myth and blind faith has taken place in the name of Lord Śhiva. Till a person is self-realized he cannot know Lord Śhiva because his nature is such that to know him, a person has first to attain that height where all the great virtues themselves enshrine within.<br /> ....These Śhaktis reside within us through the Śhiva Tattwa. To attain the Śhiva Tattwa Self-realization is essential. Kuṇḍalinī is the Śhakti and the chakras are the steps. One has to ascend all the steps to attain the Śhiva Tattwa. This is the revelation of all the Gods and Deities. This is their job and they are completely absorbed in it. Unlike human beings they do not think about themselves or their rank, etc. They are a part and parcel of Lord Śhiva. To facilitate human ascent to the Śhiva Tattwa is their nature.<br /> They need not be lectured or told anything, they are completely submerged in their task. They work in karma. They do not think they are doing anything. They are thoughtless and unmindful for their powers, like sugar gives sweetness to food, but is unaware that it is sweet. Similarly when Sahaja Yogis act they are not aware of the Śhakti within which is behind their actions. If the consciousness comes that I am the doer, I am a leader, etc. then you are not a Sahaja Yogi. Through Sahaja Yoga one becomes a karmi. He keeps performing without even remembering that he is doing anything. He does not even realize that he is loving though others find him very loving."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1993-0219 Śhivarātri Pūjā (Hindi), Kyukī Mānava kā Aṃtima Lakṣhya yahī hai kī Vo Śhiva Tattwa ko Prāpta Kare (The Ultimate Aim of Human Beings Is to Attain that Śhiva Tattwa), Mumbai, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image903.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"So it is important that you should join hands, work it out, the work of the Goddess so that Śhiva is happy and we create a new world of spirituality and beauty.<br /> May God bless you."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1991-0209 Śhivarātri Pūjā (Hindi+English), Pandal, Front, Kutab Minar Āśhram, New Delhi, India</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"Today, we are ready to do Śhrī Śhiva’s Pūjā.<br /> It is said about Śhrī Shivjī that He is very easy and very innocent.

Goddess is the One who creates this universe and in the end, She takes the form of Kuṇḍalinī and helps you to reach Śhrī Śhiva.

You are this you are that, the thousand names of Śhiva, thousand names of the Goddess, thousand names of Viṣhṇu. These are their names you are worshiping, what about you people, how many names you can have? Actually in the Pūjā when you take the names of these Śhaktis they also get awakened within, no doubt. After Pūjā you do feel that way but you don’t utilize them. <b>So many people I’ve seen have come in the Pūjā and they have got that power within themselves, same powers.

Because of which the knowledge of right-wrong, discretion remains awakened, which goes on forbidding us, ‘Don’t do this, this is wrong, this is unrighteous. This is wrong, this is deceitfulness, this is is greed, this is pride, this is jealousy, this is adharm, this is below the dignity of a man, this is not worthwhile.’ But the independence that a man has is used by him very badly and he disregards Śhiva.<br /> Śhiva drinks the poison of the whole world. Whatever amount of poison is settled in our heart, aversion towards others, evil, etc., very impure thoughts, our heart becomes poisonous, when Śhiva awakens within us, He drinks that poison.
