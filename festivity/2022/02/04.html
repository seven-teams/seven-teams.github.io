His special quality is that He is the Embodiment of Purity (Śhuddha Swarūp) and Complete Master of the Universe. He is the Incarnation of the Supreme, of Brahman.<br /> By coming into this world He has created music (saṅgīt), rhythm (tāl) and notes (sur).

So, She wanted to have Her own Son who can permeate Her Powers on this Earth.<br /> So to begin with when the Śhakti created this universe and Sadāśhiva was watching Her creation, the first thing She created on this Earth was innocence and the Embodiment of that Innocence was Śhrī Gaṇeśha. The whole Universe was covered with innocence, which we call as Oṃkāra.

Once we have lost our innocence, we cannot believe that others could be innocent. Another is that we think innocence is not important.<br /> Innocence is the sustainance [sustenance], is the basis of spirituality. If a person doesn’t have innocence, we [he] cannot rise in spirituality.<br /> <b>That’s why the first job of Sahaja Yoga is to establish Śhrī Gaṇeśha within you, to awaken Him.

It has vibrations which are seen even in the atoms and also in the molecules of all matter that has existed.<br /> So Śhrī Gaṇeśha is the first one who was established in the matter, as well. As a result, we can see, He exists in the Sun, He exists in the Moon, He exists in the whole Universe, in the whole Creation, and He continues to exist in human beings also. Only the human beings have capacity to somehow or other cover up your – the innocence. Otherwise, animals are innocent. Human beings have the freedom; if they want, they can cover up their innocence, they can shut down the doors of Śhrī Gaṇeśha and say that He does not exist. They can cloud it. And that is why we find among human beings that they are doing so many horrible things, avoiding the existence of Śhrī Gaṇeśh.<br /> But He acts. He acts in a way that He shows natural reserves of our wrongdoings. Like if you do things which are not pleasing to Śhrī Gaṇeśh, He goes up to a point, forgives you up to a point, and then He starts emerging out as diseases, as physical diseases, and in women, it becomes a mental disease. Also, it can create problems in the nature. The natural catastrophes are also only the curse of Śhrī Gaṇeśha.
