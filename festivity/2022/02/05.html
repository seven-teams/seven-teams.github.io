We should worship Saraswatī as well.<br /> Saraswatī’s work is very great. First, Mahāsaraswatī created the entire universe. The earth element is special in this. The earth element has been placed in such a way between the Sun and the Moon that any living work can easily happen on it. From this living work, slowly and gradually human beings have been generated.<br /> But we should know our own great power. That power is what we call creation power, it’s also called creativity. This creation power is the blessing of Saraswatī by which many arts have been generated.

It acts in the stomach of the Primordial Being which is a Void, also referred to as the Ocean of Illusion (Bhavasāgara). (The way this Void was created is covered later.) Hiraṇyagarbha’s Power incarnates as Mahāsaraswatī, and the entire material creation is the product of Her power and activity: She created all the galaxies, stars, and planets including our own Sun, Moon, and Earth. She also functions as the thinking power of the Primordial Being, and this process generates the Cosmic Ego (Ādi Ahaṅkāra). The channel carrying this power is the Ādi Piṅgalā Nāḍī, and it expresses the Primordial Preconscious Mind (Ādi Chitta). It acts like a postman who carries messages to the intellect of the Almighty."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>The Book of Ādi Śhakti, Chapter 1: Creation, the Eternal Play</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"Mahāsaraswatī Principle is on the right side as I’d ... you all know. First is the Brahmadeva’s Principle, which is the Saraswatī Principle, and then this Mahāsaraswatī takes you to the Principle of Mahābrahmadeva called as Hiraṇyagarbha.<br /> Now, this Hiraṇyagarbha Principle is very important for Sahaja Yogis.<br /> First of all, those who think too much or those who create too much without Realization, those who express themselves in poetry or in literature or in music, you can say, in paintings, in all kinds of arts; if they are not realized Souls, then they go to the left to the extreme or to the right. So for example, if there is an artist, if he goes to the right, gradually his paintings will become extremely violent expressions.<br /> Would be very much showing something very violent and also rather, I would say, he would be a man who would be inflexible. He’ll have his own style, he can’t move into another style. He’ll use the same style and he will not get into any other style. Kind of an austere nature he develops in his productions and then when he gets tired of it, then he will take to something, you can say, like abstract art. But without Realization, the abstract art can be something very absurd and funny."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1992-0223 Śhrī Mahāsaraswatī Pūjā, Modern Art and Literature, 24 Pukenui Road, Epsom, Auckland, New Zealand</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image892.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"...... only for hymns to be sung in the praise of God.

It changes even in everyday life. The person starts to see that they have become whole, one, 'We all are one.'<br /> So when such an artist, whatever he creates makes something so beautiful, he does it so beautifully that one accepts from the heart. From the heart people say, 'This is a very beautiful work.'<br /> Still we should understand that all the works that we do of Saraswatī, we perform the Pūjā of Saraswatī, we are not surrendered. If it is surrendered to Saraswatī and is surrendered to God, then it becomes immortal.<br /> You can see that all the art that has remained immortal, are all created for God. All the poems, songs. If you see today's songs, every time new songs come in the movies and then they die down. But we still listen to those songs or recite the verses written by Kabīr, Gyāneśhwar.<br /> Even in foreign countries I see that whatever William Blake or Shakespeare had written is still remembered. They were all realized people. Mozart was self-realized. Through their Self-realization they obtained the Mahāsaraswatī's Śhakti and whatever they wrote or created in the light of that Power was of a unique kind. There was nothing in them that you could say they were uncultured. They were so cultured that they could unite the world.<br /> Once you become a Sahaja Yogi, then you should move on the Mahāsaraswatī Tattwa. One should not only move on Saraswatī Tattwa as this limits you, limits your imagination.<br /> If the Saraswatī Tattwa is the seed, then the tree is Mahāsaraswatī. Till the time you do not convert this seed into the Mahāsaraswatī, till then you cannot merge with Mahālakṣhmī. The gift of Mahālakṣhmī within you is that you get your Self-realization.<br /> Secondly that you have achieved is Mahākālī Tattwa.<br /> All the Three Powers meet at Āgñyā."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1992-0203 Śhrī Mahāsaraswatī Pūjā (Hindi), Mahāsaraswatī Tattwa, Kolkata, West Bengal, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image893.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"The second power, which He gave us, which He sent to us, was Mahāsaraswatī and to this Mahāsaraswatī Power, <b>He called Counselor, the one who will counsel you – that means, who helps us for Yoganirūpaṇ [to see the form of Yoga]</b>.<br /> With the help of this second power, we will get Gyān [Knowledge], we will know the subtle knowledge."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1996-0414 Easter Pūjā (Hindi), Kolkata, West Bengal, India</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"Saraswatī cleanses all that is impure in nature, while with our brain activity we are spoiling all that.<br /> All our brain activity goes against pure intelligence.
