Today your attention should be on Śhrī Gaṇeśha.</b> His devotion is infinite.<br /> He has never worshiped anybody else except Mother. Hence He is so great. All other Gods appear very strong. Everyone has some specialty. What is Mother’s specialty? Her ego (aham) is nowhere felt by others. Hence Śhrī Gaṇeśha who has surrendered to such Mother is so wise and venerable, Mother has nothing with Her. Her very name begins with Ni, e.g., Niṣhakāñchan[ā] having no wealth, Nirlepā unaffected; Nirvichārā thoughtless; Niṣhprayojanā having no motives, Nigarvitā egoless, Niricchā desireless, etc. Therefore, surrendering to such Mother, who has nothing with Her, needs some kind of subtle thought, in that, Mother has nothing with Her, and therefore, nothing can be asked from Her. It shows how Śhrī Gaṇeśha by himself is fully satisfied. Where does this contentment of Śhrī Gaṇeśha come from? It is own power."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1978-1002 Letter to All Sahaja Yogis (Marathi) (1st Day of Navarātri), London, UK from Nirmala Yoga, Issue 11 (September-October 1982), Pages 25 and 26</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image1019.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="red">"Today we worship the Himalayas and the seven Goddesses whose blessings are here and pray to them to bless us with Devī Śhakti.<br /> We have received the blessings of the Devī Śhakti from a Mother.<br /> That is why, in the form of Mother, let us come to the feet (śharaṇāgat) of the Himalayas.<br /> <b>Keep your attention on yourself.</b>"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1985-0329 Śhrī Śhailaputrī Devī Pūjā (English+Hindi) (7th Day of Chaitra Navarātri), Exhibition Hall, Basement of the Puruṣhottam Hotel, Talnoo, Naddi (11 kms NNE of Dharmaśhālā), Himachal Pradesh, India</b></font></p><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkGreen">"And even that there was Military, and there were jeeps passing when I was coming, they saw Me, they had to salute.

[King] Dakṣha did not invite Lord Śhiva in the Havana that he performed and Śhailaputrī was the consort of Lord Śhiva. She is called Satī because She entered the Holy fire of Havana and ablated Herself. But by then Lord Śhiva reached there. He lifted her burnt up body from the fire. Burnt pieces of the body of Śhailaputrī fell at many places. All these places are considered to be Śhakti Pīṭhas, the places of worship, as there is in Vindhyāchala and many other places. Her power moves there and it is said that it Sanctifies everything. Her seventh power is considered to be the Power of Destruction. Śhakti manifested Itself on the right side as Sāvitrī and Gāyatrī but the destroying force was manifested in the center. In the form of Durgā and Her other forms manifested in Heart chakra.
