Navarātri is very good because these nine nights represent the main Nine Incarnations.</b> Where the Goddess took the form of Śhakti and killed the negative people. But those were easier days because negativity was understood by people and nobody sympathized. So this is what one has to understand that don't sympathize with negativity. You'll spoil them all. And always you'll find such sympathies bring forth your character also that you are also slightly negative. Because to fight negativity in modern times is a very difficult task. You cannot kill anyone: if you kill somebody, then may be that such a person is a brother or a sister or something of somebody. Or such a person would be himself or herself a seeker. So best thing is to separate like a contagious disease, keep that person out, no sympathies. And get the person cured and enjoy the life, otherwise that person is not going to be helped. It has become a very individual fight. And it's so troublesome and so disgusting. So to help Me out, you should not take any sides with negativity. That's how you can help Me the most. This is what it is the Navarātri, the Pūjā that I give you powers to fight the negativity."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1985-1009 Talk to Sahaja Yogis, after the Public Program, Flat of Ruth and Kingsley Flint, Strasbourg, France]</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image1035.png" /></div><p style=" text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>"She gives us the protection.<br /> She’s the Protector.<br /> And She’s the Mother of this world, Jagadambā."</b></font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1977-0222 Public Program, Day 1, About Different Chakras and Their Deities, Gāndhī Bhawan, Delhi University, North Campus, GC Narang Road, Timarpur, New Delhi, India</b></font><br /> <b>Today the love of Śhrī Jagadambā is expressed</b><br /> <font size="+0"><b>Jay Jagadambe</b></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>We decided to have this Pūjā of Durgā today that all negativity should be destroyed.</b> So many Deities build up the body of Kālī. Every part of Her body was created by a Deity, looked after by a Deity, and is also, later on, is reflected in you all. So they say that God has made human beings in His own image, I would say, I’ve made you in My own image, all the Deities at your disposal. They’re all with you, and they have created you – if you see it minutely – it is the Deities who have brought forth all the beauty that you had. They have made all this beautiful congregation, beautiful transformation, and they have created such angelic people out of you. They are always working it out, but one thing you have to do is to have the drive. You had pure desire to ascend, but for what? You want to have the light, but for what? You want to become gurus, for what? To save people, for their salvation. Only through your channels, I can work out Sahaja Yoga. If I could work out Myself, I would have. It’s not a question of killing one rākṣhasa. God knows how many there are, rākṣhasas and rākṣhasas. And they are everywhere, even within you they were. Now they’ve gone out.<br /> So you have to do full justice to Sahaja Yoga, that’s very important."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1992-0725 Śhrī Durgā Mahākālī Pūjā, France on the Verge of Destruction, Paris, France</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image1036.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="indigo"><b>Salutations to You O Goddess Chāmuṇḍā Nārāyanī,<br /> whose mouth was dreadful with its great teeth,<br /> Who wore a garland of human skulls as an ornament and killed the demon Muṇḍa.</b></font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>&lt;(Mahālakṣhmī Hymn, Chapter 11 of the Devī Mahātmyam)/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;<p> <font color="DarkRed">"You come up now to the Heart chakra. Heart chakra is divided into three parts. In the center of the Heart chakra resides Jagadambā Herself. But [in] the left side as I have told you resides Śhiva and His Power is Pārvatī. <b>When Pārvatī Herself separates Her identity with Her Lord and enters in the center to save Her children from the domination of the evil spirits, then She resides in the center and She is the Jagadambā. This is called as “Sacred Heart” in the Bible. She resides as Jagadambā. She has taken many Incarnations to save.</b><br /> Today there was Lalitā Pañchamī, they sang the song of Lalitā. The way She took Her Incarnations to fight the evil forces, to save the bhaktas from the domination of satanic and depraving personalities. She is there within you also, if not awakened She can be awakened. She is all the time there to save you from those satanic forces."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1976-0205 Public Program (Vasant Pañchamī), Day 2, Description of Kuṇḍalinī, after Śhrī Viṣhnu Havan, New Delhi, India</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>Now the Durgā's qualities are that She is protective of Her children, She's very gentle, very soft with Her children, and She's extremely horrifying to the satanic people, to the negative people.</b> So in this rāga I think because there are, the notes are spaced out. So either you could play it slow or you could play it fast. Nothing in between. That's why it is on a Durgā's style. You see, either She is extremely gentle or She is extremely horrifying. So because She has a double function: is one to look after Her children, and another is protect Her children from the devils. So She has to be very quick about it, to fight them, and to, in every way to frighten them and to be alert about it.<br /> So in the second part you all became very alerted I saw. In the first part you were having a lullaby because it was the Mother's Love that was playing. The second part you became alert, because She has to fight. Now, this is such a nice rāga because it gives you a better sense of security within yourself, builds up sense of security, and also as you know medically that it's important to build up this chakra because that gives you antibodies created. So to fight all the diseases, to fight all the foreign things which try to attack us.<br /> So this rāga is so apt, absolutely apt for today's atmosphere and for today's need. That we have to have the security of the Mother and the protection of the Mother and that all the evil forces must be finished from this world, and that's how this rāga has a very great significance ......"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1990-0819 Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa Pūjā, Hallowtree Scout Campsite, Nacton, Ipswich IP10 0JP, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image1037.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>"Śhrī Saraswatī is known as Skandamātā, She was not His mother and was virgin.<br /> But, but She took Skanda [Kārttikeya] as Her Son and held Him to Her heart."</b></font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1996-1221 Śhrī Kārttikeya Pūjā (Marathi+English), Śhrī Gyāneśhwara, Park (200 m from ISYRH Center), C.B.D.
