So as you say, “Mother, bless us,” I say, “You also bless Me.” You have already blessed Me by this beautiful arrangement you have made, the way you have put yourself, surrendered yourself for this great Pūjā. Because all is such an interdependent process. You do the Pūjā. I can’t do the Pūjā. <b>You have to do the Pūjā. When you do the Pūjā, the chakras are awakened. Mine are awakened, but in you, they are awakened.</b><br /> Now how to explain to people what is the importance of Pūjā is. If you have not tasted the fruit of a Pūjā it is impossible to explain. It is at a higher level only one can understand all these things. But so far whatever was done was at such a lower level by such low type of people that everything became absolutely unholy. It was all unholy doing and because of that unholy doing God, Himself is unhappy.<br /> So He has created this Universe to create realized Souls, not to create useless people, not to create people who do not believe in God, who do not believe in higher life, who do not believe in leading a life of purity. He never created this Universe for them. They are just existing, just like dead people. They are not living people. <b>So those who believe in God, those who worship Him with all purity, are actually, in a way, giving blessings to God because it is so pleasurable for Him to see that they have understood, that they have felt it, that they have liked it.</b>"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1983-0330 Birthday Pūjā and Havan (English+Marathi), Birla Matushri Sabhagar, New Marine Lines, Churchgate, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image923.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Shubh Mangalmay, Divas He Aya</b></font><br /> <font size="+0">The Auspicious Benevolent Day has come</font><br /> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Ādi Śhakti, Swayam Hain Padhāri </b></font><br /> <font size="+0">Ādi Śhakti has come Herself</font><br /> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Shubh Mangalmay, Divas He Aya</b></font><br /> <font size="+0">The Auspicious Benevolent Day has come.</font> <font color="DarkGreen">Sur Nar Muni, Sab Jhūm Rahe Hain<br /> Aaj Prakriti Khil, Phul Rahi Hai<br /> Phūl Khile, Bhanware Khag Mil Ke<br /> Rachaita Ke, Hi Gun Gāyen<br /> Shubhmangalmaye diwas hai āya</font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"The birthday of your Mother, and all such celebrations, have a very deep significance. Because on such occasions, special vibrations flow in the atmosphere. When all the celestial bodies, the Eternal Personalities, Gods and Goddesses, s-sing the praise, and that's how the whole atmosphere is filled with mirth and happiness.<br /> Human beings also, express their gratitude. Expression of gratitude and love is done in different, different ways in different countries, but the substance remains the same and the forms change.<br /> The substance is like the ocean which flows continuously towards the shores, and the ripples which touch the shores are again repelled back, and a nice pattern is formed. It is such a spontaneous thing, and is so beautiful, creates such a beautiful pattern in the atmosphere. All these waves when they weave together the pattern of love, they soothe human beings, they enchant human beings, and the whole thing is very blissful.<br /> On such occasions a special type of feelings develop, which we cannot express in words so the expression could be in any form. But the main thing is the expression. God has expressed Himself by Creation, by creating this Creation. While the Creation has to express its gratitude by glorifying Him, and this play must go on eternally. It's the most beautiful play. Those who indulge into this play lead an eternal life. That life is unending, never breaks and binds the whole universe with its beautiful music."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1980-0323 Birthday Pūjā, Guarding Against Slothfulness, London BVB, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image924.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Happy Birthday Śhrī Mātājī!!!</b></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a><br /> <font color="DarkRed"><b>Janam. din. ayo, Ādi Śhakti ka</b></font><br /> Ādi Śhakti's Birthday has come!<br /> <font color="DarkRed"><b>Smaran. din. ayo, Nirmal.
