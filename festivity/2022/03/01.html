So, what demarcates today's celebration, is the establishment of Śhiva on this Earth. In the material self.<br /> Every matter has been created with a Deity in [it].

Because on the Day of Mahāśhivarātri, when there is a talk about Śhivjī, then it has to begin with origin. How much He is Primordial, means when there is a first manifestation of form of God Almighty.<br /> He is called as Sadāśhiva when He is enlightened from Brahma. That is why the one who is Śhivjī is called as Ādi [Primordial].<br /> You see, before the complete manifestation of any tree its seed has to be seen first and that is why it has to be called ‘Bīj Swarūpa’ – form of the seed. That is why the glory of Śhiva is very important. After that, after His manifestation, the power within Him gets Her form and is called as Ādi Śhakti.<br /> The same Ādi Śhakti enlightens the three forms of the God differently which you know as Brahmā, Viṣhṇu and Maheśh, that is, Śhiv Śhaṅkar. It means that Ādi Śhakti holds the three aspects of a diamond.<br /> And when in the Doomsday the whole created universe, whole manifested world gets dissolved and the same is incarnated in the form of Brahma, then also Sadāśhiva remains there. And his connection to the part of God is always maintained which is never manifested and which is a non-being."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1976-0229 Śhivarātri Pūjā (Hindi), Utpatti -- Ādi Śhakti aur Śhiva ka Swarūp (Genesis -- Ādi Śhakti and Śhiva in Form), Mumbai, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image909.png" /></div><p style=" text-align:center;"> <font color="Indigo"><b>Na Me Dwesh.

As you know the difference between Sadāśhiva and Śhrī Śhiva. <b>Sadāśhiva is the God Almighty and He is a witness of the play of the Primordial Mother.</b><br /> The combination between Sadāśhiva and the Primordial Mother Ādi Śhakti is just like a moon and the moonlight or the sun or the sunlight. We cannot understand such relationship in human being, among human marriages or among human relationships. So whatever the Ādi Śhakti’s creating, which is the desire of Sadāśhiva, is being witnessed by Him. And when He is watching this creation He is witnessing all of it into all details. He witnesses the whole universe and He also witnesses this Mother Earth, all the creation that is done by the Ādi Śhakti. His Power is of witnessing and the Power of Ādi Śhakti is this All-pervading Power of Love.<br /> <b>So the God Almighty, the Father, the Primordial Father we can say, expresses His Desire, His Icchā Śhakti as the Primordial Mother and She expresses Her Power as Love. So the relationship between the two is extremely understanding, very deep, and whatever She’s creating, if She finds, if He finds there is some problem or there are people, human beings specially who are trying to obstruct Her work, or even the Gods who are not the Deities are trying to express their egos, He is the one who brings forth their destruction.
