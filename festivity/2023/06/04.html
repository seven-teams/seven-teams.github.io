Sadāśhiva is the God Almighty. She is His breath, as they some people call it. Some say She is the Desire and some say that She's the Entire Power of Sadāśhiva and Sadāśhiva cannot do anything without Her Powers.<br /> ......<br /> The first thing is, we must know, that She created a Kuṇḍalinī in the Mother Earth Itself and She created Śhrī Gaṇeśha out of the Mother Earth, it's very interesting.<br /> So, the Mother Earth becomes a very important thing for us. If we do not know how to respect the Mother Earth, we do not know how to respect ourselves.<br /> The expression of Ādi Śhakti within you is the Kuṇḍalinī, no doubt. That is the reflection of Ādi Śhakti in you. But the reflection in the Mother Earth is also expressed, as you all know, in different places, different countries, different cities as the manifestation of chakras and Ādi Śhakti's creations. It was very important first to create a very holy Mother Earth for human beings to be born on them [it]. So the reflection of the Ādi Śhakti as Kuṇḍalinī first was on the Mother Earth.<br /> Kuṇḍalinī is a, we should say, is a wee part of the Ādi Śhakti. Or we can say that She is the desire, pure desire of the Ādi Śhakti. So Ādi Śhakti is the desire, complete desire of Sadāśhiva, and Kuṇḍalinī, Ādi Kuṇḍalinī, is the desire, complete desire of Ādi Śhakti."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1997-0525 Śhrī Ādi Śhakti Pūjā, You Must Give this Love to Others or Respect the Mother Earth, Hangar, Cabella Ligure, Alessandria, Italy</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>"Somebody asked Me, uh, "Is it necessary to have this Pūjā?", [laughing:] I think, if there's any Pūjā that you should do, it is this one, is [of] Ādi Śhakti.

So there's a difference between the Ādi Kuṇḍalinī and the Ādi Śhakti.<br /> Ādi Śhakti is the Parāśhakti, is the Power which is beyond all the powers, which controls all the powers. And one of the powers of Ādi Śhakti is Kuṇḍalinī.<br /> For example, the Kuṇḍalinī which is placed within Me, in the triangular bone, is not [the] totality of Me. In the same way, the Kuṇḍalinī, which is placed within you, is not the totality. Of course, It is the power which is there to give you your Self-realization. Is the power that redeems you, that nourishes you, that enlightens your centers.<br /> But there are two other powers, as you know, very powerful, which are working through Iḍā and Piṅgalā. And the third one is Mahālakṣhmī which is in the center.

But what is the pure Desire of God Almighty?<br /> If you see your own desires, come out of what? Not out of the Divine Love but out of carnal love, out of material love, of out of power love. Behind all these desires there is love.<br /> If you do not love something you will not desire it. So, these mundane types of love that you have, for which we spend so much of our time uselessly, actually they do not give you satisfaction, because that is not true love that you have. Just infatuation for the time being, and then you just get fed up with it, and from there you jump to another thing, to another thing, to another thing.<br /> So Ādi Śhakti is the Embodiment of God's Divine Love, is God's Pure Love, and in His Love what did He desire? He desired that He should create human beings, who would be very obedient, would be sublime, would be like angels. And that was His idea: to create Adam and Eve."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1993-0606 Śhrī Ādi Śhakti Kuṇḍalinī Pūjā, Incarnation of Divine Love, Tent, Cabella Ligure, Alessandria, Italy</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Dene Zeri Amuchya Shiri,</b></font><br /> You have given us so much<br /> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Pari Agnya Jana Tu Par Kari,</b></font><br /> even to those who don't have any knowledge,<br /> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Deshi Jag.
