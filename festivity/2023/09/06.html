He wanted to eat the butter. Now why He wanted to eat the butter because all the butter that was made in Gokul, in that place, was sent to Mathura where this horrible King Kaṃsa was ruling. And all his military people became very strong by eating that butter. So He didn't want them to eat the butter, so He started a kind of a tribe of small children and a game that they climb on top of each other. And the butter was kept in a pot hanging from the roof, so they would go and eat all that up. In that little childhood He started this innocent play, so all the children used to climb up and eat the butter. So now there's no butter left, so how will they take it to Mathura? This was done and one day His mother caught hold of Him.<br /> She said, "Did You eat any butter from here?" All butter was here all around. He said, "How? How can I eat the butter? See, can I reach My hand there? See now, how can I ..." "Oh, so You took the stick and broke it?" "No, no, I did not." "Then what is all this?" "See, these are all My friends who ate it. I put it on My mouth so that you can beat Me." So innocently talking like an ordinary child, this One, an ordinary, simple child. So Mother said, "All right. Let Me see Your mouth."<br /> He opens the mouth and She sees the complete, She sees the complete universe, complete universe revolving into His mouth.<br /> And She sees it. And She says, "Oh Lord, please forgive Me. I forgot! I really forgot that You are the Lord of this universe and I am doubting You!" She just fell at His feet. "There must be some play in what You're doing." In a simple, innocent way like a child would say He told the Mother.<br /> So the innocence of a child and the innocence of a virgin, or you can say the chastity of a virgin and innocence of a child brought forth, brought forth the existence of America."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1987-0808 Talk to Sahaja Yogis, Woman Plays the Most important Role or The Power of Woman, the day before Śhrī Viṣhṇumāyā Pūjā, Y.M.C.A.

We may mentally think, "Oh, I'm doing all for God's sake I'm doing this." That's just our imagination. But you just don't do it, because the karma has to become akarma, means 'non-action' -- that's only possible when you get your Self-realization. When a self-realized Soul gives you Kuṇḍalinī, he doesn't say -- raises your Kuṇḍalinī, doesn't say, 'I do it.' He says, "It's rising, it's going, it's working out." In the third person he talks, so the whole thing becomes akarma.<br /> Then He says that, "Whatever are the flowers and things like that you give Me," that's the Bhakti Yoga, "I'll take it." But He uses only one word on which He has made everybody dance, and that word is ananya -- <b>Ananya Bhakti: "When there is not the other, when you are united with Me."</b> "</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1990-0315 Talk to Sahaja Yogis, before the Kathak Dance, Āśhram, 10 Clarence Street, Burwood, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia</b></font></p><p> <font color="blue">"So this Viśhuddhi on the right-hand side is to be controlled by surrendering as it is said, actually you surrender your ego to begin with. And this ego when you surrender, it has to be done from you heart, it should not be a lip service. From your heart: "I don't want this ego any more, I want reality. Let the reality be seen by me, felt by me, enjoyed by me." And once you start doing it from your heart you'll be amazed that your voice will become sweet. Apart from that it will have the Divine Power flowing through it. That is what we say that you have now got Vāk Śhakti, means 'the Power of Speech'.<br /> So when you surrender ego, what do you do actually is to say that, "I'm not doing anything, it is You who do everything."

Individualism, when it is not connected to the mains, is destruction. Like all these trees you see, they are individuals as you see them separate, but inside they are fed by the same Mother [Earth]. They have the same sap running in them. When this connection is broken, then all this individualism is nothing but destruction and that's how in America the connection with the collectivity was broken by every sort of funny methods that one cannot conceive how human beings can go to that level."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1984-0818 Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa Pūjā (the day before Janmāṣhṭamī Day), Tent, Backyard, House of Judy Gaddy, 442 Liberty Road, Engelwood, NJ, U.S.A.</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image1219.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>"You become the Dharma of Virāṭ.<br /> Now, what is the Dharma of Virāṭa?
