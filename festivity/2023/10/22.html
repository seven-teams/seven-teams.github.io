She's the reflection of the Ādi Śhakti. So when you worship Devī, first you worship also your own Kuṇḍalinī by giving Her credit because She has given you this Realization. It's much deeper understanding than normally people have about the Devī Pūjā because they are not realized Souls. Their Kuṇḍalinī not is awakened. <b>So normally when they do Devī Pūjā it's for the purpose of getting Realization so that the Devī should be pleased -- prasanna -- and should give them Realization, or must get our chance to get to somebody who will give them Realization.</b> But you are at a different level now. So it's more of a thanksgiving to your own Kuṇḍalinī and to Ādi Śhakti, glorifying that whatever has happened so miraculously is because of the Kuṇḍalinī which was within you, which was reflected by the Ādi Śhakti.<br /> But one has to know that only we are realized Souls is not the point, only that we can feel the vibrations is not the point, that we can give Realizations to other is also not the point.
