In that, the play of the Devī is the Navarātri -- in your ascent -- from ages. <b>Navarātri that's why is the most important Pūjā. In Sahaja Yoga, Navarātri is the most important Pūjā, I would say. Though we can say in modern Sahaja Yoga Sahasrār Day is, because that's how you started getting your Realization. But if you go to the whole historical events of evolution you'll find [that] Navarātri is the one which has brought you to Sahasrāra. Without the help of the Devī at different stages of your ascent, you could not have been in a position to receive your Realization. So all the steps that you took in the past are today worshiped and are used for thanking the Devī for what She did to bring you down here. So it's like a thanksgiving. Without Her work, nothing could have happened.</b><br /> So when we read about the Devī, about Her Incarnations -- how She came on this Earth to save Her bhaktas, people who were trying to ascend, to cross this Bhavasāgara, how She worked hard, how She fought the devils, how She cough... She killed the demons, single-handed -- She took upon Herself the responsibility of making the people cross the Bhavasāgara.<br /> <b>Guru gave you the strength to have dharma but She is the One who brought you out. Even those who were dhārmik could not do it because of the demonic pressure. She's the One who fought, single-handed, with Her Powers of destruction. In Her Love for you She fought. She brought you to this level.</b>"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1985-1019 Navarātri Pūjā (cusp between the 6th Day and 7th Day), Complete Dedication, Gymnasium, Weggis (19 kms E of Luzern on Luzern Lake), Lucerne, Switzerland</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image1237.png" /></div><p style="color:DarkGreen; text-align:center;"> <b>Ā wahanam Janami</b><br /> I know not how to invoke You,<br /> <b>Na Janami ta varchanam</b><br /> I know not how to welcome You,<br /> <b>Pūjam chaiwa na Janami</b><br /> I know not how to do Your Pūjā<br /> <b>Kshamyatam Parameśhwarā</b><br /> Forgive me, Ādi Śhakti,<br /> <b>Kshamyatam Parameśhwarā</b><br /> Forgive me, O Supreme One</p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>The Devī incarnated on this Earth to kill the demonic personalities who try to destroy all the good qualities of women.
