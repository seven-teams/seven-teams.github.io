And He was put in the bed which was made of dried grass.<br /> He came on this Earth to show people that for a person who is an Incarnation or who is a highly evolved soul, is not bothered about the comfort of the body. His Message was so great and so deep, but He had disciples who were not prepared for the battle they had to fight. Is the same thing that sometimes happens with Sahaja Yoga. He had only 12 disciples, we too have 12 types of Sahaja Yogis, and all of them, though [they] try to dedicate themselves to Christ, fell a trap, some of them, to the worldly aspirations or to their own hankerings.<br /> <b>His Message of Love and Forgiveness is the same even today.

Very little is known about Jesus Christ because in young age he left his house and after returning he lived only up to the age of thirty year. But during this short period he did tremendous work.<br /> ......<br /> <b>So He told two things, the first is to "forgive everyone." Knowingly or unknowingly if someone troubles you, you should forgive him.</b> You will not get tortured but if you do not forgive then you torture yourself because another person is sitting nicely. So you must develop the habit of forgiveness.<br /> <b>Second thing that He told us is that, "You are the Spirit." Know this Spirit, the Self. No one can touch the Spirit, can destroy it, no one can torture it.</b> If you are that Spirit then you should be established in it. But to achieve this Ātmā Tattwa the awakening of Kuṇḍalinī is necessary. First is to work out the awakening of the Kuṇḍalinī and then to get established in it. Until you are established, you will remain entangled in stupidities. So one should know how to be established within, to remain within thyself."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>2000-1225 Christmas Pūjā (Hindi + English), Success in Sahaja Yoga Is What Will Last Forever and Everybody Will Remember It (Try to Learn Sahaj Culture), Gaṇapatīpuḷe, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image1306.png" /></div><p style=" text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Bāla vadana tava baghuni Khristā</b><br /> I see Lord Christ as an eternal child<br /> <b>Sakala durita bhaya bhāle astā</b><br /> When the world was drowning in sin<br /> <b>Tava divya rupa jaga lyāle</b><br /> The new Divine form took birth on this Earth<br /> <b>Mama zhāle, mana dhāle</b><br /> My mind exulted with joy<br /> <b>He sarva jagi sancharale</b><br /> This love had now spread throughout the world<br /> <font size="+0">(He Prem Murti)</font></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"The aim of Jesus Christ was to open the center of your Āgñyā and to achieve that purpose He got Himself crucified and then He resurrected. It appears to be a miracle but for the Divinity there is no miracle as such. He proved that human beings could rise above the center of Āgñyā and on this center <b>He told two mantras which we call Bīj Mantras: Ham and Kṣham. Kṣham means to forgive. Kṣham is the biggest mantra. The ego of the person who knows how to forgive, gets destroyed</b>.<br /> One is proud of small-small things. For example, if you tell someone to sit on the earth, his ego gets hurt. If someone is told to sit in the chair, he will reply, 'This chair is very small, why have you given it to me?' Everyone has some expectation about him and if his expectations are not fulfilled, his ego immediately comes up. Unknowingly, sometimes such things could be done but the egoistical people take it as their insult.<br /> Such people make their condition very miserable. All the time they think they are being insulted and humiliated. He is always obsessed with this thought and he draws negative meaning of whatever is told to him.<br /> So we have to think of what Jesus Christ had thought. He said, "Forgive those who have trespassed against you."<br /> Now see the results if you forgive everyone. You will neither suffer nor get disturbed mentally. You will not think of the person whom you have forgiven. Nothing could go against you because you forgive everyone.<br /> We get this power from the center of Āgñyā. The person whose Āgñyā is clear forgives everyone. If we do not forgive we torture ourselves and play in the hands of others, who assume power over us. Forgiveness is the greatest message that Jesus Christ has given to mankind.<br /> <b>Second is Ham, it has altogether different meaning. Ham means 'To know thyself'. You have to know that you are the Spirit. You are not this body, mind, brain or ego. You are the Spirit. When you know this Ham then it will be clear to you that you are the Ātmā.</b> The Spirit means that all the ego, foolishness, ignorance that we have in our mind, are meaningless. All these negativities have absolutely no place in the pure Spirit. You are very pure."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>2000-1225 Christmas Pūjā (Hindi + English), Success in Sahaja Yoga Is What Will Last Forever and Everybody Will Remember It (Try to Learn Sahaj Culture), Gaṇapatīpuḷe, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image1307.png" /></div><p style=" text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Putra Vatsalā Kalyāni Mahāpātaka Nāshini</b></font><br /> <b>Most lovingly showers blessings on Her children,<br /> Destroys the greatest of sins</b><br /> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Yoga Kshema Nivardini Nirānanda Pradāyini</b></font><br /> <b>Taking care of spiritual and material well-being, Bestowing eternal bliss</b><br /> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Mahārupā Mahāpujyā Ādimātā Nirmala Mā,Jaya He</b></font><br /> <b>Awesome form, worthy of great worship, Primordial Mother</b><br /> <font size="+0"><b>(Jai He Jai He Jai He Devī)</b></font><br /> <a href="https://seven-teams.github.io/Videos_Links.html">video</a></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"It is said in Marathi that: "Forgiveness is the decoration of a vīra." Vīra is the brave. Only the brave could forgive.<br /> Now, how many of us really know how to forgive others [laughing:] and to love others?<br /> So many write that, "Mother, my heart is like a stone." So now you jump in the sea! What are you doing here? Stones must go to the sea. Or they say, "My heart is not open." I say, "Why do you write like this?" "Because I'm very, very frank and honest." With whom are you honest? For such people there is no Sahaj Yog. They should really leave Sahaja Yoga and go away.<br /> Sahaja Yoga is meant for people who have a very large heart where [laughing:] Christ could be adorned. He's to be restored upon that great heart of yours. In every way one has to enlarge the heart.<br /> That's why I think William Blake very clearly said that, "England should be the Jerusalem." But only by saying that, 'William Blake said so,' one should know that it's complete [darkness], complete [darkness]. He is hoping against hopes. Large heartedness is missing among the people who live on the heart.<br /> As you know about the French, they call themselves Christians. Italians, who have so-called Christianity, have the worst pictures; so licentious, so horrible, so much against Christ. It's very surprising. How we can do such things to bring bad name to Him and to the whole world where you represent Him?<br /> People think Christianity means licentiousness, permissiveness, drunkenness, abandonment of all the values, while Christ was just the opposite of.<br /> Absolutely, He did not need any values. He was guṇātīt. He is dharmātīt, everything. But how He lived on this Earth, such an ideal!<br /> So before us we have got a great ideal. We don't have to follow the ideals of these horrible kings who lived there. But we have to follow the ideal of Christ and those kings who followed the ideal of Christ. Because if you are following Him, the path that you are following has to be, the essence of Christ's life is a pure life of love and sacrifice. This is what one has to follow.<br /> Throughout His life, He has been using this essence just to establish Himself in our Āgñyā chakra and that's what He's worked very, very hard to do that. Let us not do anything to let Him down in our character."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1985-1224 Talk to Sahaja Yogis (Christmas Eve), before the Evening Program, Pune, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image1308.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>"So, they say 'Merry Christmas' is enjoyment for joy.
