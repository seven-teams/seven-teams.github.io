They are doing very vital work of God of giving Self-realization. This is the need in this Time of Resurrection.<br /> Everyone must help in every way possible to deepen and expand the experience of Divinity so that all the human race could be saved and glorified as the great children of God Almighty."</b></font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1983-0328 Message (Holikā Dahana), New Delhi, India</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkGreen">"Śhrī Rāma incarnated before Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa. He was Maryādā Puruṣhottama and as such lived a very austere life. As a result of the austerities practiced by the King Himself, the whole society turned sober and serious. The element of joy and gaiety was completely missing. In Dwāpara Yuga, when Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa incarnated, He wanted to put an end to this extreme seriousness prevalent in the society. He thought of having a festival in which everyone could laugh heartily and have fun and joy. So the festival of color Holī, was started with this purpose. People, however, took undue liberties and misused the festival to the extent of defaming it. I had also to tell that “I do not play Holī at all.”<br /> The myth behind it is that there was a demoness named Holikā. She was the sister of Hiraṇyakaśhipu, the father of Prahlāda. Since Prahlāda was the devotee of Lord Viṣhṇu, his father, the demon king, used to harass and trouble him. Hiraṇyakaśhipu wanted to kill Prahlāda. Holikā had the boon that fire won’t burn her. Hiraṇyakaśhipu asked Holikā to take the boy Prahlāda in her lap and sit on the burning pyre, thinking that she could not be burnt. But to his surprise Holikā was burnt to ashes and no harm done to the child devotee of Śhrī Viṣhṇu! It was a significant incident which proved that it is sin to be cruel, arrogant and aggressive. Despite her boon, Holikā was burnt down and no harm done to the innocent child – devotee!<br /> Such is the myth and traditionally we burn Holī every year. There lies a lot of truthfulness in all our traditions. We have to understand that misdeeds, cruelties and troubling others are evil tendencies. Right-sided people develop these devilish traits in them. We should not allow such thoughts to dominate our brains and should give no significance to them. We should love all. It is very important to understand otherwise we shall all be demonic like Holikā. Now right-sided people develop this problem. It is a big lesson for them. No harm was done to the innocent child Prahlāda. God Almighty saved him, but this demonic woman, who got a boon as a result of her severe penance was reduced to ashes. One should understand that all these demonic tendencies are destructive. We should give them up and be generous and loving towards all. Quarreling and fighting with each other are not virtues. These are demonic tendencies.<br /> We should not take to these evil traits, we are Sahaja Yogis. <b>We are special people, we have incarnated to change this world, to transform it completely. We should put our attention on that. We are very highly placed, higher than all others. We have to save this world from falling to these tendencies.</b> These are much in vogue these days. It is unworthy to say these abhorrent things and to be cruel and dominate others. It is unnecessary in Sahaja Yoga.<br /> You are powerful enough. You have such powers within you that if someone endeavors to trouble you, you will be protected like Prahlāda. No one could destroy you. You are so much protected! No such thing could destroy you."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>2002-0329 Holī Pūjā (Hindi) (Holī Raṃgavalī), Palam Vihar, Gurgaon, Haryana, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image1126.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed"><b>"You should have faith in God that is the main thing which people don’t understand what it means to have faith in God.

And after giving this boon, he regretted a lot because she took Prahlād in her lap and sat in the fire. And Agni Devatā had a big dilemma, that ``I have given this promise to her, that I will not burn her and how can I fulfill this promise? <b>And Prahlād, is Himself innocence personified, He is Himself an Incarnation of Śhrī Gaṇeśha</b> and how can I burn Him? Nobody can burn Him. And He is also beyond my powers. He is formed from my power." So he thought, ``What is this ego? that in front of such a Great Power what can I talk about my power? I have no such power which can face Him. His Power is so great that I cannot burn Him whatsoever I may try.
