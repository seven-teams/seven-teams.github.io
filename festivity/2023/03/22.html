Devī has many other names also but first of all She incarnated as Śhailaputrī in the cold of Himalayas. She incarnated and whatever She was to do. She started there.<br /> ..When Kuṇḍalinī rises and reaches the Heart chakra then it manifests and becomes more powerful and effective because Kuṇḍalinī is Jagadambā. In Sahaja Yoga, when Kuṇḍalinī is awakened it, settles in Heart chakra. It protects you and takes care of you nicely.<br /> No one could harm you at all if you keep the Mother in your heart. The power of the mother always protects the children. Whenever there is some danger, it is mentioned in medical terminology that the sternum bone starts shaking and antibodies that are present all around get alarmed. In Sahaja language, these antibodies are called gaṇas. They get ready to fight it out. She is the empress of these gaṇas. They follow her commands as there is no difference between Śhrī Gaṇeśha and Devī. Both are so identified.<br /> Gaṇeśha is Her Son and She is His Mother. In Sahaja Yoga, She protects all those who have awakened Śhrī Gaṇeśha in themselves. She protects them just like Her own children at every step. She supports them because She is the Mother and you are the Gaṇeśha. But the Gaṇeśha within you should be fully awakened and pure. If there is obstruction in this chakra, it should be removed."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>2000-0405 Guḍhī Pāḍavā Pūjā (Hindi), Noida Bhavan, New Delhi, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image1138.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkGreen">"Today it’s a great day, very, very great day.

All our dates and festivals are decided according to it, particularly our festivals. We follow the Moon calendar whereas foreigners follow the Sun calendar. That is the reason that the dates of their festivals never get changed. But all our festivals depend on the position of the Moon. That is why their dates keep changing and all our festivals are celebrated on different dates."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>2002-0413 Guḍhī Pāḍavā Pūjā (Hindi), Terrace Garden, Palam Vihar, Gurgaon, Haryana, India</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is new year's day and the beginning of the Moon.</b> That is why this day is given so much significance. It is known as Guḍhī Pāḍavā. A flag is put on a stick and on it is put a small pitcher. This pitcher represents Kuṇḍalinī. It is taken as a symbol. The Śhālivāhanas were the devotees of the Devī [Goddess] and it is told that they used to offer shawl to the Goddess. In the beginning they were called Sāt[a]vāhans because they worshiped Seven Plexuses and this Sāt[a]vāhana was ultimately changed into Śhālivāhana. But the symbol of Śhālivāhana is the same. They put up a ‘guḍhī’ means a flag and a small pitcher is put on it as a symbol. This pitcher has a particular shape which represents Kuṇḍalinī. So they were the worshipers of Kuṇḍalinī and followed it. That is the reason they made this symbol in this way.<br /> All those who follow Kuṇḍalinī put up a guḍhī in their houses and also put a flag on it and thus it is indicated that they welcome Kuṇḍalinī and exhibit it in a special way."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>2002-0413 Guḍhī Pāḍavā Pūjā (Hindi), Terrace Garden, Palam Vihar, Gurgaon, Haryana, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image1139.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkGreen">"<b>Chaitra is the month.</b> And this is the time when – [Marathi] – <b>Gaurī is the Chaitra</b>.<br /> So the establishment of the Gaurī is taken place during these nine days.<br /> But Gaṇeśha has to be established before anything else.<br /> Though first Gaurī had to come, you can see that.

Gaurī who created Gaṇapati is the Gaurī from Chaitra and we all believe that.<br /> In the same way our Śhālivāhans have given it so much importance that Guḍhī Pāḍavā starts on the first day of Chaitra month, because Gaurī first is Śhakti, who started the work, to start any work first we worship Gaṇeśha, this is also done by Gaurī.<br /> Gaurī has put Gaṇeśh in the temporal world or universe so that the innocence which Gaṇeśh has should spread in the whole world. And before anyone else, She established Chaitanya in the form of Gaṇeśh for the whole world and spread it everywhere. Then we will do whatever is required but first is the Spirit, the Chaitanya. The world’s Kuṇḍalinī, Mother Gaurī has done this work.<br /> The importance of this day is that this is the beginning, creating Śhrī Gaṇeśh on Her on own, no contribution from Sadāśhiv, She has not yet met Sadāśhiv, so the Virgin Gaurī, She created Gaṇapati from Her Powers, because She is Śhakti Swarūpa, She can do anything.

You have to think as to how to speak with others. It’s a routine for Me. Such and such person is coming, how shall I talk to him and make him understand? When we see this love all around, it fills our heart. Exchange this love with others and talk to them sweetly. Sahaja Yogis should not be angry with anyone. Meet people very affectionately. You should be pure within and this purity of heart should be visible. There should be no anger and hatred. Only then people will appreciate you. Now you are all self-realized and I am telling you, how your personality should become magnetic. I hope you follow this advice and look within with love, not with hatred.
