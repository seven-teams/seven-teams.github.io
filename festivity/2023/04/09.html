You have to rise into that new realm, which is the Realm of God Almighty, what you call the Kingdom of God.<br /> And He said it very clearly to Nicodemus that, "You have to be born-again." And when he asked: "Am I to enter back into my mother's womb to be born again?" And He said it so clearly! It's so clear! Those who don't want to see can remain blind! But he said it very-very clearly that, "No! That is, whatever is born of the flesh is the flesh, but whatever is born of the Spirit is the Spirit."<br /> I mean, nothing could be more clear than that, that it has to be born of the Spirit.

And, though it is gross, in subtle it has happened. To take the awareness through this center of Āgñyā was done by Christ, by His crucifixion.<br /> He came as a gross person, just like a gross human being.<br /> His body died, but did not die, because that body was also made of that imperishable Divine Vibrations, as you call, a Radiations or this Brahma. They did not die. And that's why the body did not die and He resurrected with His body.<br /> He had to die to show that the body though [it] dies, can be saved. That's why He had to be crucified.</b> Otherwise He could not have shown you.<br /> But it's actually it was experimented in the Vaikuṇṭha, as you call it, that He died and then resurrected to show that this does not die.<br /> Kṛiṣhṇa has said, "Nainaṃ chindanti śhastrāṇi, nainaṃ dahati pāvakaḥ" [Bhagavad Gītā 2.23, line 1]. "It is not killed by any weapon, neither it is burned by any fires, nor it is blown by any wind." "Na chainaṃ kledayanty āpo, na śhoṣhayati mārutaḥ"[Bhagavad Gītā 2.23, line 2]. "Neither, nothing can suck in." That Spirit is He.<br /> ......<br /> But again you cannot crucify Him. Now He has become Ekādeśha Rudra as described, the Eleven Rudras as you know very well. These are all the Powers of Śhiva given to Him.<br /> <b>Up till now, till He was born, Kṛiṣhṇa had given Him His Powers, and that He became Mahāvirā[ṭ]. He was even placed above Kṛiṣhṇa.</b><br /> But now, when He will come, He'll be bestowed with the Destructive Powers of Śhiva, eleven of them. One is sufficient to finish all the universes. And that's what is described as the coming of the Christ. You cannot crucify Him anymore.<br /> And the time has come for all of us to be prepared for us to receive Him. We are not yet ready to receive Him. Unless and until you are realized, you cannot receive Him, because if you remain unrealized till He comes, you'll be finished, you'll be gone, you'll be destroyed. He'll just come to destroy all the nonsensical things. So this short time should be used for your emancipation and for your development.<br /> ......<br /> <b>For us, Sahaja Yogis, it is important to understand the significance of Christ's life. That His body was the only body who was made of these Radiations.</b><br /> All other bodies were human bodies.

Not that we are born out of matter, our body, but we are attached to it, we want it, we want to have it. Whatever you want, that sustains itself, by your desire, because now you are on the stage. If you want to sustain the matter, if you want to keep the matter as the first priority, it will remain. It cannot disappear. It has to go out of your mind that matter cannot hold you any further.<br /> Christ rose out of the matter, came out of the tomb which symbolizes the matter which has enclosed us within, which has to be opened out with our spiritual power.
