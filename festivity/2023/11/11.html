Also, this was celebrated much earlier, when Narakāsura [Tārakāsura] was killed. And this is how we express our joy and happiness, our gratitude to God that He has protected us always with His Power, with His Śhakti and has destroyed all the rākṣhasas and all the evil forces of this world.<br /> <b>This is the time of Thanksgiving. On this day we have to go to our elders and give thanks to them for whatever they have done for us. To all those people whom we have to give thanks, today is the day when we have to ask God to bless all these people.</b>"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1979-1020 Diwālī Pūjā (Diwālī Day), Āśhram, 8, Hamilton Road, Dollis Hill, London NW10 1NX, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://pub-1e517d8c73a64c9c82977d676b1fff72.r2.dev/image1282.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>Then the fourteenth day is very important, because that is the day the Goddess as a power, as a power, because it was Kārttikeya who killed Narakāsura [Tārakāsura], the devil.</b> And he was one of the worst of all, could not be killed. So Śhiva and Pārvatī were married for this special purpose to produce this powerful Śhakti Putra, means the Son of the Śhakti, known as Kārttikeya. And He was just born to kill this horrible devil, called as Narakāsura [Tārakāsura]. And He killed. That is the day, fourteenth day. It is something like Halloween, that day. Because that is the day they opened the gates of hell and put all the devils into Hell."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1981-1101 Diwālī Pūjā (5th day after Diwālī Day), The Mahālakṣhmī Powers and the Powers of Water, Āśhram, 44 Chelsham Road, Clapham, London, UK</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"Then there is, the second day is where Narakāsura [Tārakāsura] was killed. Now Narakāsura [Tārakāsura] was the one who was the devil from the Hell, let's say -- very cunning, very clever -- and he was killed by the Goddess. Actually he was killed by a, another Incarnation, Kārttikeya, but Goddess gave Him the power to kill. So when he was killed it was celebrated because the evil was killed. But we don't find that these days the evil people are getting peace awards. So what is the reason for this kind of a perverted brain? How is it they are using perversion? Just the opposite of it. What has worked out these things? So again we find the same so-called freedom to become also evil. So we have freedom to become evil. First of all we have freedom not to be benevolent, and secondly to become evil we have freedom.<br /> So <b>the Narakāsura [Tārakāsura] within us must be killed, the one which teaches us evil, to do evil to others. If you are busy doing evil to others you can never enjoy. Because you enjoy doing evil to others. So that has to be faced within ourselves, not in other people. It's very easy to say that this Sahaja Yogi is caught up, that Sahaja Yogi is like that, but very difficult to say, `Mother, I am caught up. I have got this problem within myself.' So when you start seeing yourself your heart opens out. Unless and until you learn how to open out your heart how can you enjoy? Open your heart.</b><br /> Many people live on very superficial level. All right, some of them might say that, `I am possessed, Mother. I've got this possession.' Why? `I've got this conditioning, that conditioning.' But why? You don't want to enjoy. So watch yourself, see for yourself. This is my conditioning, `All right, I'll put you right.' See in the mirror. Tell yourself, `This kind of a useless conditioning I've got it from where? Because I'm Indian, because I'm French, because of English.' Open the heart. And opening the heart is only possible if Narakāsura [Tārakāsura] sitting on your heart is killed, finished, once for all.<br /> In small, small things there is joy. In very little things also there's a ripple of joy. If you are sensitive you can catch it. And why not enjoy? Why to have these stupid conditioning on our heads for nothing at all that we can't enjoy? Enjoyment is only possible if you take out this one, sitting on your heart.<br /> <b>So that is the second part of the Diwālī that you have to open your heart.</b> Forget your nationality, forget your race, forget everything. It's a funny kind of things Sahaja Yogis have. They must be respected, they must be treated like this or maybe that we are something great and they are no good. If you cannot mix up with the collective it's something wrong with you. Nothing wrong with others. Easy to find faults with others. But what's the use? If you start finding faults with others you do not become clean."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1989-1029 Diwālī Pūjā (Diwālī Pāḍavā), Be Honest to Yourself, Auditorium, Gymnasium, Montecatini Terme, Tuscany, Italy</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://pub-1e517d8c73a64c9c82977d676b1fff72.r2.dev/image1283.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>Rājalakṣhmīs are the Goddesses who are looking after the country.</b><br /> Like England has a Rājalakṣhmī, too.
