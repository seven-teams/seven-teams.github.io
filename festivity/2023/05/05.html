Also, it had to be very quick. So all the Gods requested that now, I, the Ādi Śhakti has to take the birth.<br /> They all tried Their best. They did whatever was possible. The Saints were made by Them but very few. They incarnated and people made religions out of Them which were perverted, brought Them bad name. No reality in those religions.

It was Sahaj, spontaneous, but every way and there was no confusion, there’s no quarreling, no fighting, nothing. Such an integration, spontaneous, whether it is on the stage or stage of life.<br /> Now, as we are all global personalities, we are all integrated and those who were acting were enjoying as well as the ones who were looking at them were also enjoying in the same manner.<br /> It was such a good also integration between the one who was acting, or the all those who were there, and all those who were watching – I couldn’t understand whether the people who are seeing them are also acting, or also those who are acting are also seeing.<br /> It was a beautiful blending I must say, and I congratulate all the leaders of all these five countries, who have contributed so well to this deep sense of integration.<br /> Not that is the integration within that is important – of course that’s very important for a personality, but for our work, for our global emancipation we need integration of all the nations, and understanding of all the nations, because these barriers are created by human beings, not by God Almighty.<br /> So we have transcended those barriers, and the way we are all sitting together in a complete integrated mood is – you don’t know what your Mother feels, I, I just can’t believe that in such a short time this we have achieved, in My lifetime I can see all these things happening.<br /> So it was such a beautiful sahaja, spontaneous, creation of the Spirit of this integration, and I congratulate all the leaders for this, and we all should thank them, for giving us this beautiful integrated, Sahaj spontaneous illustration of [the] Sahaj character.<br /> Thank you very much.<br /> May God bless you all."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1996-0504 Talk to Sahaja Yogis, after the Evening Program, the day before Sahasrāra Pūjā, Hangar, Cabella Ligure, Alessandria, Italy</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/image1179.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"Today we are celebrating the Sahasrāra Day.<br /> Perhaps we have not realized what a day it must have been.<br /> <b>Without opening the Sahasrāra, God Itself was a myth, religion itself was a myth,<br /> all talk about Divinity was a myth.</b><br /> People believed in it but it was just a belief.
