Today is a very great day. I think this day has come only because of His blessings that Sahaja Yoga has been blossomed in you people. The Guru of all the Gurus -- Ādi Guru Śhrī Dattā Mahārāja. I bow to Him, He is My Guru also.</b> He has taught Me quite enough on Sahaja Yoga all through My many births. And because of that only I have been able to do some work in this birth also, continuing to do.<br /> "Gurūr Brahmā Gurūr Viṣhṇu Gurūr devo Maheśhwara, Gurūr sākṣhāt Parabrahma tasmai Śhrī Guru dev namaḥ." The Guru is Brahmā [creator], Viṣhṇu [sustainer] and Maheśh [destroyer] and the Guru who is Himself God, I offer My obeisance to Him.<br /> By the time Ādi Śhakti created the universe, after creating the entire universe, like how a king spread out his kingdom and comes to see the world thereafter in a disguise, in the same way Ādi Śhakti has also incarnated on this Earth many a times. But no matter how supreme is Ādi Śhakti She still needs a human Guru. The place of man is still superior to that power.<br /> If Śhakti has to take form of a human being then She is required to come on this Earth only after having achieved Her father sometimes, Her brother sometimes and Her son sometimes. First of all try to understand that entire universe was created by Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, and Maheśha. At that time a thought came in Ādi Śhakti's mind to lift people out of the world, who were stuck in it, and that if these three Principles [of Brahmā, Viṣhṇu, Maheśha] were to be combined together somehow and the childlikeness and innocence of Śhrī Gaṇeśha could be absorbed by it then it is possible to form a Guru from them who has to do a great task.<br /> She [Śhrī Ādi Śhakti] was incarnated in the form of Satī Anusūyā. This is the only such a Satī in the whole world who has thought of emancipation of the human beings. This is a very great thing.<br /> These Three Children [Śhrī Brahmā, Śhrī Viṣhṇu and Śhrī Maheśhwar] came to Anusūyā.<br /> The meaning of Anusūyā is the One who is void of envy, She does not envy anyone, who is the Universal Love."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1973-1209 Public Program (Hindi), Day 3, Śhrī Dattātreya Jayanti, Biralā Krīṛā Keṃdra, Chowpatty, Girgaum Chowpatty, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://pub-1e517d8c73a64c9c82977d676b1fff72.r2.dev/FT0109.png" /></div><p style=" text-align:center;"> <font color="Red"><b>"Śhrī Dattātreya is none other than Ādi Guru.<br /> He is My Guru.

He was created as the three-headed child, Dattātreya, by Ādi Śhakti who appeared on Earth during the Tretā Yuga as Satī Anasūyā, wife of the Sage Atreya. He was born as Ādināth [Ṛiṣhabhadeva, first Tīrthaṅkara] who founded Jainism -- one of the oldest religions. Then he was born as Rāja Janaka, father of Jānakī also called Sītā, Rāma's wife. She was an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti.<br /> The Primordial Master was also born as Macchindranāth, and again as Zoroaster who was worshiped by the ancient Persians, and still revered by Parsis. Earlier He had taken birth as Abraham and later as Moses, the Fathers of Judaism. In China He was born as Confucius and as Lao Tze, and in Greece as Socrates. He took a very significant Incarnation as Muhammad Sāhib, the Messenger (Paigambar) and founder of Islam, whose daughter Fāṭimah was Sītā reborn, an Incarnation of Ādi Śhakti. She was the origin of the Shiya sect among the Muslims (in Indian dialect Sītā is called Shiya). Yet again He took birth as Guru Nāṇak, founder of the Sikh religion, whose sister was Nāṇakī (Jānakī, i.e., Sītā). Most recently He was born as Śhrī Sāī Bābā of Śhirḍī in the Indian State of Maharashtra where He died in 1918. Altogether there were ten major Avatāras of Dattātreya."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b></b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://pub-1e517d8c73a64c9c82977d676b1fff72.r2.dev/FT0110.png" /></div><p style=" text-align:center;"> <font color="Red">" "Gurūr Brahmā Gurūr Viṣhṇu Gurūr devo Maheśhwara, Gurūr sākṣhāt Parabrahma tasmai Śhrī Guru dev namaḥ."
