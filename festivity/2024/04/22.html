He gives us guidance and protection.<br /> ......<br /> It is very surprising how a Deity like Śhrī Hanumāna, who is an eternal child, because He was like a monkey. His head was that of a monkey, if not of an elephant.<br /> So He was an eternal child and He was the one who was used to run the right side of human beings. He was told that, ``You must control the Sun," to begin with He has to control the Sun, that the Sun in the people, if there is too much Sun then He must try to control it and make it cooler or smoother."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1990-0831 Śhrī Hanumāna Pūjā, Electromagnetic Force, Schloss Schwetzingen, Schloß Mittelbau, Schwetzingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://pub-1e517d8c73a64c9c82977d676b1fff72.r2.dev/FT0017.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"It is such a joy today, and the whole atmosphere seems to be bubbling with it, as if the angels are singing.

But now, you all have become angels from the human beings. It's a very great achievement of Sahaja Yoga. The qualities that are born with the angels are seen from their very childhood."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1989-0423 Śhrī Hanumāna Pūjā (St. George's Day), You Are All Angels, Cliftonville, Margate (123 kms ESE of London), UK</b></font><br /> <br /> <font color="blue"><b>Aarakta dekhile dola</b></font><br /> You saw with your eyes (the Sun) as red as blood,<br /> <font color="blue"><b>Grasile Surya-Mandala</b></font><br /> and You placed in your mouth the entire domain of the Sun<br /> <font color="blue"><b>Vadhata vadhata vadhe<br /> Bhedile shunya-mandala</b></font><br /> You who are forever increasing in size from the minutest dot;<br /> You can pierce even the domain of the absolute.<br /> <font size="-1"><b>Shri Māruti stotra<br /> (Verses in praise of Śhrī Hanumān by Rāmadāsa)</b></font><br /></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today we are celebrating Hanumāna's Jayanti</b> [birthday].<br /> What to say about Hanumāna?

Then we have to keep balance. We love others and with the power of the love, we keep on doing our duties.<br /> Śhrī Hanumāna was very powerful.

It's right, whether we know it or not, Its power is innate. It is Divine Power. <b>When a human being bows before someone and regards him higher, it is the expression of that Divine Power.</b> But when a person is respectful to his guru then he gets blessed with the grace and power of the guru.<br /> So <b>the devotion and the power (bhakti aur śhakti) are not different things.

Whenever anyone troubles you, your protectors are there. Often you see that security moves with the ministers and VIPs. The security of Sahaja Yogis also moves with them; that is, the security of gaṇas. Gaṇas have many things to do. Gaṇapati -- <b>Śhrī Gaṇeśha keeps them informed about you as to where is the problem, from where you are getting attacked and troubled. You do not know that if anybody wants to attack you secretly, even then these God's gaṇas stand by you. When Śhrī Gaṇapati informs about it, Śhrī Hanumāna sets them right</b>.
