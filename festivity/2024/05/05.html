It was not so easy to reveal it and I wanted to find out how to reveal it.<br /> First of all I thought that the seventh chakra must be opened, which I did, on 05th May 1970. It is a secret in a way. Formerly, the Brahmachaitanya was avyakta. It was not manifested. It was not expressed by itself, and so the people who managed to reach Brahmachaitanya somehow, by attaining `realization', said -- ``it was nirākār kā guṇa" ``you are like a drop that gets dissolved in the ocean."<br /> No one could say, explain or tell people anything more about it. The Great Incarnations also who came out of this Great Ocean of Brahmachaitanya, tried their best to share it with the best available followers -- which were very few -- and introduce them to this Brahmachaitanya. But because the Brahmachaitanya was not in avyakta form, these Incarnations got dissolved in it.<br /> ......<br /> <b>Now I have come as the Incarnation of the Brahmachaitanya as a whole.</b> The sea of the Nirākār has now become a big cloud [Sākār]. It has taken a form. Those who came before were all a part and parcel of it. Now the whole has come. This cloud has rain water. The rain water is nourishing the minds of the people. Gradually they are brought to a level were their Kuṇḍalinīs have risen. They have got their Realization and now gradually they are feeling everything on their senses, their fingertips. This is the reason why nobody has talked about vibrations so clearly. They managed to talk about Chaitanya Laharī. This was so because of its avyakta [unmanifest] form. It was only a state. A state to be enjoyed, only in that state with no manifestation in the gross."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1987-0227 Talk to Sahaja Yogis (Marathi and Hindi), From Pieces of Conversation with Dr. Talwar and other Sahaja Yogis Leaders, after the Śhivarātri Pūjā, Juhu, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://pub-1e517d8c73a64c9c82977d676b1fff72.r2.dev/FT0024.png" /></div><p style=" text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Amhi Matajinchya Char.nasi Alo</b></font><br /> As we have come to the Feet of Mother<br /> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Chaitanya Sange Amrutat.
