And the wick, as you call it -- is called as bātī in Hindi language -- is like your Kuṇḍalinī, so the Kuṇḍalinī had to meet the spark. The beautiful lamps were all a waste, purposeless, pointless. And this is the great blessings in modern times, that so many lights are enlightened and we are having a dīpāwali of human hearts. When you become the light, you don't worry about the lamp, how it looks, how it is to be made, it's all done.

Is not necessary that you should be born as brothers and sisters, not necessary. But you are born, because if you are realized Souls you are born as brothers and sisters. So that purity must be maintained in the society of Sahaja Yoga. Very important it is. That we should try to develop this situation that brothers and sisters are something very pure. Their relationships are very pure. And they should not be at all challenged.<br /> It is so much so that even if you call somebody your brother, he is your brother and the more you develop this relationship, the better your left Viśhuddhi will be.

Such a person is completely useless: the one who tries to get out of the family.<br /> All of you have to be supporting as each other, helping to each other, not shouting at each other, [not] getting angry with each other, trusting each other, not finding faults, treating each other with respect [<font color="orange">unclear</font> and love].<br /> This is the most important thing, which Sahaj Yogis don't understand, that you are Saints and you have to respect each other."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1980-1109 Diwālī Pūjā (Bhāūbīj Day), The Mahālakṣhmī Power, Temple of All Faiths (now demolished, 11c Pond St), Belsize Park, Hampstead, London, UK</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://pub-1e517d8c73a64c9c82977d676b1fff72.r2.dev/FT0104.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>This is the promise of Diwālī to you all, that you will reach highest and the noblest way of life.</b> Every word I say will be there to prove what I say is there.
