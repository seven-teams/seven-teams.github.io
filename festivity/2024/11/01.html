When you get Realization you are so much engrossed into it, you enjoy it so much that you think that, 'Now! The time has come for me to do this and that and that, and I'm going to contact these people and I'm going to give this to news to this one, and I'm going to do this work and show to Mother that what She has given me, I have made it many folds.' Because it was a new experience, great experience, the only experience that you have been waiting for.<br /> And that you also decide that, 'I am going to now become the torchbearer of this great light that has come into me, and I am going to form one of the lights of this Dīpawali.'

And, that is actually more, sort of, we can say is a social thing in India, we need not use that, what ever suits us. You can have your own New Year. Because in the south, say in Maharashtra they have another New Year, as I told you where Śhālivāhana in his dynasty started another calendar and they celebrate that.<br /> So all these things are nothing is rigid about anything, one must know. Nothing is rigid. Rigidity comes from ignorance.<br /> It's all for you, for your joy and happiness. The whole festival system is for your happiness and not for the happiness of the time or date. It's for you, so it should be adjustable according to your needs and understanding. And also according to your national way you live. They should be no addiction to any particular type of culture, a particular type of ideas. It's all for you. All these festivals are for you, not for Gods. They don't have these festivals. It's only for you people these festivals are there. And when you celebrate them, that's only for your joy and your happiness. And that's how you should celebrate in a way that gives you the greatest amount of happiness. And the festivals, all the festivals of the world must be celebrated.

What is missing? "We have not yet given anything to someone, we have not shared and eaten, we feel that we have eaten alone." At that point, the Mahālakṣhmī Principle gets awakened in you and when it gets awakened, if you slowly make your flame taller with balance, not with imbalance, but with balance, then She will sit in your Brahmarandhra and your whole life will get enlightened."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1986-1101 Diwālī Pūjā (Hindi + Marathi) (Diwālī Day), Puṣhpa Maṅgal Karyalaya, Mote Mangal Karyalay Road, Sheth Narayan Das Dugad Chowk, Bibwewadi, Pune, Maharashtra, India</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"...... the <b>Mahālakṣhmī Principle is the principle where you start seeking the Truth and nothing else.</b><br /> But how can you seek the Truth without any light in your hand?

How can you take to Mahālakṣhmī Principle unless and until the Lakṣhmī Principle is embedded in you? Unless and until you feel that love for each other, you have felt that love, you have expressed that love, you have been generous, you have been enjoying the generosity of your own.

Not to find faults. If you are finding faults then know that you are not Sahaja Yogis. If you are trying to control others then know that you are not Sahaja Yogis.<br /> Even the leaders, I would say, should never try to control. They must know how the principle is working in the silence; see for themselves how it is working. It's a trick you must learn. Of course, little correction is needed. That time you correct the person. At that time, doesn't matter. But you must know how the whole principle of benevolence is working itself. The whole Paramachaitanya is doing the benevolence part; you must know that.<br /> As I've told you before also, you have to be like the sea which receives all the rivers into it. If you are on top of the hill you cannot receive anything. So you have to be like a sea to receive everything and you have to be at the height. As I told you the other day, the same way that very close to the sea there should be a personality which is above everything else. Such a beautiful personality you should have, is the depth of the sea and the height of the Kailāsa."</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1989-1029 Diwālī Pūjā (Diwālī Pāḍavā), Be Honest to Yourself, Auditorium, Gymnasium, Montecatini Terme, Tuscany, Italy</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://pub-1e517d8c73a64c9c82977d676b1fff72.r2.dev/FT0100.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="DarkRed">"...... <b>I bless you with all the Lakṣhmī Principle and Mahālakṣhmī Principle but above all the Principle of Love, the Pure Love without any expectations, nirvajya.</b> I bless you all on this auspicious day.<br /> May God bless you!<br /> Have wisdom and understand that Mother has said it out of Her heart, out of Her Love, out of Her feelings for us.<br /> May God bless you!</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1990-1021 Diwālī Pūjā (4th day after Diwālī Day), Touch Your Depth, Chioggia (50 kms S of Venice), Veneto, Italy</b></font><br /> <br /> <font color="DarkRed"><b>"......
