Now Narakāsura [Tārakāsura] was the one who was the devil from the Hell, let's say -- very cunning, very clever -- and he was killed by the Goddess. Actually he was killed by a, another Incarnation, Kārttikeya, but Goddess gave Him the power to kill. So when he was killed it was celebrated because the evil was killed. But we don't find that these days the evil people are getting peace awards. So what is the reason for this kind of a perverted brain? How is it they are using perversion? Just the opposite of it. What has worked out these things? So again we find the same so-called freedom to become also evil. So we have freedom to become evil. First of all we have freedom not to be benevolent, and secondly to become evil we have freedom.<br /> So the Narakāsura [Tārakāsura] within us must be killed, the one which teaches us evil, to do evil to others. If you are busy doing evil to others you can never enjoy. Because you enjoy doing evil to others. So that has to be faced within ourselves, not in other people. It's very easy to say that this Sahaja Yogi is caught up, that Sahaja Yogi is like that, but very difficult to say, `Mother, I am caught up. I have got this problem within myself.' So when you start seeing yourself your heart opens out. Unless and until you learn how to open out your heart how can you enjoy? Open your heart.<br /> ......<br /> <b>Open the heart. And opening the heart is only possible if Narakāsura [Tārakāsura] sitting on your heart is killed, finished, once for all.</b>"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>1989-1029 Diwālī Pūjā (Diwālī Pāḍavā), Be Honest to Yourself, Auditorium, Gymnasium, Montecatini Terme, Tuscany, Italy</b></font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"So what do we do to remove the darkness of the night is to put lights. In the same way people should be enlightened. There should be light in the heart of people. Once they're enlightened, this darkness from which we are suffering because of our ignorance will be finished and we'll have the Absolute Knowledge. So this is a new age that they are talking about is here right now, here, that it is going to work out in such a manner that it will be all enlightened personalities together, and they'll know what is light is, what is Real Knowledge, Gyāna.<br /> So ours is a Path of Knowledge: Knowledge that is Love, Knowledge that is Compassion. This is what we have to understand, that we have come into another area, arena, where all the skirmishes and the troubles of Kali Yuga cannot enter.<br /> ......<br /> <b>With the darkness in the heart, darkness in the mind that you don't know where are you, what are you doing and what you should be doing, just like going amok you go on hitting each other. This is what is Kali Yuga, and the one who recognizes it and gets out of it is the Sahaja Yogi.</b> Otherwise you are just like other people if you are still indulging into the same periphery, in the same circles of imbalance. ......<br /> So you are all enlightened souls. For Me that's the Diwālī. If the people are enlightened that's the Diwālī: that they remove all the darkness of Kali Yuga and you all enjoy the beauty and joy of Kali Yuga. It's very, very symbolic I should say, that Diwālī has already started. We have many lights, and we have to get more lights -- not because it is short of light; why are we taking more lights, why do you want?
