She has a big body, everything is there, but She stands on a lotus. That She takes all Her weight within Herself, She just sucks in Her weight as Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa has described. That like a tortoise sucks in his legs inside his body, in the same way we have to suck in all the weight of money, weight of your positions, weight of your so-called education, weight of some aristocratic family you are born of. This is all nonsense which makes you a heavy person to go down very fast.<br /> So She stands, or floats in a way, on the lotus. And what a thing is beautiful, this lotus, that She doesn't disturb any petals of the lotus, nothing. She just stands, peacefully, in a balance. Unless and until you have balance you cannot stand on a lotus. So She is so balanced. Her center of gravity is so balanced that She cannot topple down.<br /> ......<br /> <b>Now She has a hand, one hand like this, one hand like this, and there are two hands which have got again the lotuses, the pink ones.&lt;/b?

There's no joy. When you have joy, you don't want to fight, you don't want to do anything that is harmful. You don't want to say anything after anyone, not only that but you do not want to have something that will spoil this Mother Earth or which will bring ecological problem. No, you just don't want it, don't want to do anything because it harms harms others. People feel unhappy about it whether it is here, India, anywhere. You just feel that 'Why should I do such a thing which is not so congenial to others?' I mean, it's not joy-giving.<br /> So when you have joy, you have to be joy-giving. And if you are not joy-giving, that means there's something lacking in your Sahaja Yoga and that's why we have to come up now. We have to become Sahaja Yoginīs and Sahaja Yogis.
