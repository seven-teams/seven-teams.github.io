But they don't know that there is a climax of everything. And that point has arrived where all the good people, especially the Sahaja Yogis should put all their mind to the destruction of these horrible personalities like Mahiṣhāsura.<br /> In those days, it was very simple because devils came as devils and you could see them, that they are devils, and all their behavior proved that they were devils. Why they did it? Why were they cruel? Because so-called 'human beings' as they are -- they are not -- they are by nature devilish and they want to do something by which they can destroy human beings, and good human beings. <b>It is evident that the time has come for them to be destroyed.</b>"</font><br /> <font size="+0"><b>2001-1021 Navarātri Pūjā (5th Day), You Should Become Really Soldiers of Love and Peace (Overcome Hatred with Love or To Hate is a Very Bad Quality), Sportcamp, Avras, Loutraki, Greece</b></font></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://pub-1e517d8c73a64c9c82977d676b1fff72.r2.dev/FT0074.png" /></div><p style="text-align:center;"> <font color="Indigo"><b>Raudrāyai namo nityāyai</b></font><br /> Salutations to Her who is Terrible, Eternal,<br /> <font color="Indigo"><b>Gauryai dhātryai namo namaḥ,</b></font><br /> To Śhrī Gaurī, Supporter of the Universe,<br /> <font color="Indigo"><b>Jyotsnāyai ch’endu-rūpinyai</b></font><br /> To Her who is the Moon and Moonlight,<br /> <font color="Indigo"><b>Sukhāyai satatam namaḥ</b></font><br /> And Happiness itself, we bow constantly.<br /> <font color="DarkRed"><b>Auṃ Twameva sākṣhāt Śhrī Aneka-śhastra hasta sākṣhāt Śhrī Ādi Śhakti Mātājī Śhrī Nirmalā Devī namo namaḥ!</b></font><br /> <font size="+0">(You are the One who wields many weapons in Her hands)</font></p><p> <font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today is the eighth day of Navarātri, but it is great day for Sahaja Yogis because it is the most important period.</b> That is, the seventh center we have crossed and we are on the eighth center.

You cannot kill anyone: if you kill somebody, then may be that such a person is a brother or a sister or something of somebody. Or such a person would be himself or herself a seeker.<br /> So best thing is to separate like a contagious disease, keep that person out, no sympathies. And get the person cured and enjoy the life, otherwise that person is not going to be helped. It has become a very individual fight.
