At this moment we should be very thankful to the Sun. It is by the grace of the Sun that so many things take place in our country.

Now you should make use of these vibrations, establish the śhakti within you, establish the peace within you and show the world that this power is within us and we have to acquire it. We have to nurture this, improve this with your good qualities and truthful speech.<br /> Today is very special day because the Sun is particularly benevolent towards us on this day.

Because whatever creativity is in this Universe, the creativity is nourished by the Sun. The Sun gives it the energy, and the Creative Power of the Paramachaitanya, its aspect of action, has got activated through Sahaja Yoga. Till now Paramachaitanya was not successful in any task. The reason was, that the Sun had not yet appeared in its courtyard. But now this Sun has risen in the courtyard of Paramachaitanya. And because of that you all have the light of it within you. Because of that light, your Kuṇḍalinī has awakened, and within you, the field of creation has fully blossomed. And this field of creation you all are developing, in a way that the whole world can benefit from it. And it's a very great and divine thing. This could not take place earlier. <b>In our country many Sages have expressed many ideas about, that such a day will come, when collectively this creation will get awakened.</b><br /> That creation has awakened now. And that's why this is not only an occasion for Earth's creation but a great occasion for Sahaja Yoga's creation also. This year specially is considered to be a very important year for Sahaja Yoga, and the light of Sahaja Yoga will establish very deeply in the people.

It's not meant for one individual, not at all for one person but for the whole world. We have Sahaja Yogis all over the world, but they don't spread Sahaja Yoga. They are satisfied with their own motives. This is not Sahaja Yoga. You must openly talk about and say about it. But Sahaja Yogis are very shy, they don't talk about Sahaja Yoga.
