And that model has to be perfect. And that was a perfect model, which then started perfecting the rest of it. So that is the perfect model which is in the Principle of this Ascent, and that is working out this ascent.<br /> Now, the perfection of the rest of the universe takes place in various directions. But today we have to consider the Mahālakṣhmī Principle.<br /> Now Mahālakṣhmī, as I told you, is a perfect principle. Is a perfect principle, it's perfect in it.

That you have to get out of the bondages of ego. That you have to become absolutely a free glorious personality. And that you have to fight the superego influences and all the bad conditionings should be thrown as torn clothes and should wear new beautiful clothes of Sahaja Yogis.<br /> Let all the people, let all the Sahaja Yogis raise their voices from the top of their houses and top of their mountains, the top of their higher positions.

In the sense that is the residual power of creating everything, left side, right side, and then She enters into our sacrum bone.<br /> So, in the Mahālakṣhmī temple, in Kolhapur, they sing a song of Kuṇḍalinī Ambe that, "Oh Ambā, please rise," "Kuṇḍalinī, please rise." In the Mahālakṣhmī temple they have to do it because through Mahālakṣhmī channel only She rises.<br /> Now the Mahālakṣhmī Principle within us starts manifesting when our Lakṣhmī Principle is complete.

Now one may say how can brain have compassion? But the Kuṇḍalinī comes out of the Heart center. That Heart center enlightens your heart and the first thing that shows in you is the feeling of tremendous compassion. You don't worry about yourself, you do not think about yourself, you all the time you are thinking about others' Realization.
