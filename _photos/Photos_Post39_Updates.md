Dear Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginīs,<br>
<br>
As today is the 7th anniversary of <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Eternal Moments</b></font>, we would like to bring to your attention the following updates.<br>
<b>1.</b> The website has more than 36K images.<br>
<b>2.</b> The galleries of <a href="https://eternalmoments.smugmug.com/Temporary-Displays"><font color="DarkGreen">Temporary Displays</font></a> have now a simples structure: there are five of them for the current month and the prior 4 months.<br>
<b>3.</b> There are more than 10% of the Photos that are explicitly marked as being from bmp, tif, cr2 and nef and the percentage will considerably increase in the upcoming months, hopefully it will cross 50% in due time. There are few hundreds more still left to be marked as such, we are gradually doing it.<br>
<b>4.</b> Started 3 Marriages galleries at the link <a href="https://eternalmoments.smugmug.com/Permanent-Displays"><font color="DarkGreen">Permanent Displays</font></a>. They will be gradually filled it and brought up to date.<br>
Please kindly share the news with all our brothers and sisters.<br>

Jay Śhrī Mātājī!<br>
