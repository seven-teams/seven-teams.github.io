Dear Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginīs,<br>
<br>
We are pleased to let you know that the XYZ Collection, also called the unnamed collection, has been completed. It has the largest number of galleries: 55. Moreover, it has 1,464 Photos (which is less that 6.26 percent of all Photos) and 87 photos Moments of Joy (which is less than 1.21 percent of all the photos Moments of Joy). We will continue to keep these percentages low and hopefully they will get even lower. Your help to identify the photographs of the Photos and photos from the XYZ Collection which are not yet credited to certain photographers would be greatly appreciated.<br>

As another update, we have started adding Moments of Joy galleries to countries: we will go chronologically through all the 28 collections and collect their photos Moments of Joy in the corresponding galleries of countries. At the end of the process, the photos Moments of Joy will be displayed both chronologically and country-wise.<br>
<br>
Please kindly share the news and the link with all our brothers and sisters.<br>

Jay Śhrī Mātājī!<br>
