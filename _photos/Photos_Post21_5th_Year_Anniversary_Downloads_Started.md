Dear Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginīs,<br>
<br>
We are pleased to mention that there are 23,999 Photos uploaded. Today the download buttons for the Photos of the Named Collection with more than 6.1K Photos have been activated. Each day, we aim to do the same for one extra Named Collection. So far, we have permission to do it for about 20 named Collections, and it is likely that the number will increase. When the process is completed, there will be a brief update on it.<br>
The Eternal Moments website was created (started) on September 18, 2018. So today is its 5th anniversary. As such, we feel the need to write a few lines on the 5 years completed.<br>
In the 1st year, the framework was completed and about 2.9K Photos uploaded. The start was not easy: there were about 600 hundreds empty galleries and where to search and what to do to make them non-empty was not at all a clear-cut thing.<br>
In the 2nd year, the uploads were stopped as the Divine Treasure website was started and it required a lot of attention to fill in it as well. With so many galleries empty, it was hard to restart the uploads and as result for about 14 months no uploads were made.<br>
But in early December 2020, the team got a 3rd member which led to a completely new dynamism at all levels, especially related to Eternal Moments. By May 2, 2021, more than 6.3K Photos were uploaded, which was just nicely above the self-imposed minimum of 6K Photos uploaded in order to make the website public.<br>
The last 28 months have been well documented by a variety of posts on Photos, so we will not say more words.<br>
Perhaps we could add that there are almost 31.7K Photos and photos uploaded (i.e., when the photos Moments of Joy are accounted as well) and only 147 empty galleries.<br>
Each Photo is a blessing, and we fall short of words to thank Shri Mataji again and again for all Her love, divine teachings, blessings,  eternal moments, and actually each and everything.<br>
We are also very grateful to all photographers and collectors and volunteers.<br>
Finally, we would like to thank all Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginīs who in various ways contributed to Eternal Moments so that we all enjoy, benefit and grow.<br>
<br>
Jay Śhrī Mātājī!<br>
