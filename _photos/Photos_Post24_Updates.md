Dear Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginīs,<br>
<br>
We would like to bring to your attention the following updates:<br>
<br>
1. Among the current 34 Collections, the Photos of 19 Named Collections are downloadable and the Photos of 2 other Named Collections will be made downloadable as soon as a good number of their Photos are replaced by recently scanned Photos of higher quality and resolution. The Photos of the remaining 13 Collections, including the XYZKnown and XYZUnknown Collections, will not be downloadable for the time being (did not get permission).<br>
<br>
2. The new folder <a href="https://eternalmoments.smugmug.com/Temporary-Displays"> Temporary Displays</a> of the main webpage of <a href="https://eternalmoments.smugmug.com/"> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Eternal Moments</b></font></a> has 3 galleries: <b>Chronology Last 1 to 30 Days</b>, <b>Chronology Last 31 to 60 Days</b>, and <b>Chronology Last 61 to 108 Days</b>. So, each Photo uploaded to a Collection, besides being collated to the corresponding gallery in the Countries Folder, will be  also collated in <b>Chronology Last 1 to 30 Days</b> for the first 30 days, then moved to <b>Chronology Last 31 to 60 Days</b> for the next 30 days, then moved to <b>Chronology Last 61 to 108 Days</b> for the next 48 days, before being finally moved to the corresponding gallery of the Chronology Folder.<br>
<br>
3. The folder <a href="https://eternalmoments.smugmug.com/Permanent-Displays"> Permanent Displays</a> of the main webpage of <a href="https://eternalmoments.smugmug.com/"> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Eternal Moments</b></font></a> has 4 galleries. The first 3 galleries, called <b>Crowns</b>, <b>Incomplete Titles</b>, and <b>Lotus Feet</b> are complete ONLY outside the period 1982 to 2009: they will be completed in due time. The 4th gallery called <b>Processions</b> has been completed. The first, second and fourth galleries have been maintained as folders on CCT's hard drives from the very beginning (i.e., from September 2018) to facilitate its work on titling, dating, and sequentializing of the images, and it has been felt that many could benefit from them as well.<br>
<br>
Please kindly share the updates with all our brothers and sisters.<br>
