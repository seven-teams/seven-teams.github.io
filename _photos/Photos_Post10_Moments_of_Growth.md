Dear Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginīs,<br>
<br>
We are pleased to bring to your attention the oldest website of Photographs <a href="https://imageevent.com/sahaja"><font color="DarkGreen"><b>Jai Shri Mataji or Sahaja Image Events</b></font></a> which is managed since the end of 2021 by the Photo Subteam. We have just taken the small Step 4 of the database: the sharing of all photos Moments of Growth and of other related photos. To begin with about 230 photos uploaded yesterday and today we have just created 3 new folders with 12 galleries in total and we hope many-many more will follow out of the thousands and thousands of such photos currently in the CCT database. The Step 4 is part of the yearly long offering at the Lotus Feet of our Divine Mother and of the sharing celebrating the 100 years Birthday Anniversary and expressing our eternal gratitude and love to Her.<br>
You are all invited to either start dedicated new galleries or to contribute to the existing galleries on this website.<br>
Please kindly share the news and the links to the three folders with all our brothers and sisters.<br>
