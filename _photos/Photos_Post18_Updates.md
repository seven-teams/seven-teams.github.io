Dear Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginīs,<br>
<br>
We would like to bring to your attention the following updates:<br>
1. All caption issues resolved.<br>
2. To ease the usage via cells, all galleries now have less than 600 images.<br>
3. Chronology Folder has 104 galleries.<br>
4. Searchable words updated (considerably enlarged).<br>
5. Starting adding cities with IAST to searchable words.<br>
6. The feeds are on.<br>
7. So far this year, there have been almost 3.9 million views (1 Photo or photo viewed, counts as 1 view).<br>
8. In July 2023, there were 844,078 views, the most so far in a single month.<br>
9. On July 24, 2023, there were 223,440 views, the most so far in a single day.<br>
10. 
10. As an average uploadflow, we are aiming to have at least 210 Photos and photos uploaded to <font color="blue"><b>Eternal Moments</b></font> per month and 90 photos uploaded to <a href="https://imageevent.com/sahaja"><font color="DarkGreen"><b>Jai Shri Mataji or Sahaja Image Events</b></font></a>.<br>
11. We still have many thousands of Photos and photos Moments of Joy and Growth left to be uploaded from 16 of the existing 30 Named Collections.<br>
12. Current priorities on uploading for the next 3 to 6 months: (i) the remaining 125 slides/negative digitized; (ii) to replace priorly uploaded Photos by new high resolution scans; (iii) to extensively upload Photos and photos to the already started 30 Named Collections; (iv) to honor all requests to start new collections; and (v) to start on our own initiative 1 or 2 more Named Collections.<br>
13. We are also reuploading Photos that were marked "(from tif)" and were actually digitized from negatives/slides: they will be marked as "(from tif-neg)" once reuploaded.<br>
14. Unfortunately, we did not progress with the manual adding of additional keywords for the estimated 10K Photos from certain months or reuploaded events. So, this will be an ongoing activity for many-many months.<br>
15. We are gradually starting to reupload all photos Moments of Joy so that their titles are fully searchable as well.<br>
16. We are constantly working to improve the sequences within events: though glaring errors have been likely all eliminated, quite a few improvements are possible and ought to be performed.<br>
17. We will start shortly to write about our understanding of the protocols and our suggestions: your cooperation and support would lead to a huge progress in the whole database.<br>
18. There have been suggestions to either open the download buttons for the galleries of Chronology Folder or for the galleries of all Named Collections. We shall reach very shortly a decision on this.<br>
19. We are considering adding a new folder called Chronology Recent for keeping Photos for the first 108 days after being uploaded.<br>
20. The current pool for new uploads of Photos has way too many items (including mixture with photos, folders, subfolders, images of Deities, subtle system, etc.) and because of that request for different searches can take too much time to be done thoroughly and as such they will be honored with discretion.<br>
Please kindly share the updates with all our brothers and sisters.<br>
