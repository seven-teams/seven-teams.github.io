Dear Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginīs,<br>
<br>
Jay Śhrī Mātājī!<br>
<br>
The photos of handwritings are very special photos Moments of Joy that are very relevant to multiple projects, searches, and studies. As such, we are pleased to make an offering at the Lotus Feet of Śhrī Mātājī and to let you know that Handwritings Galleries have been singled out from the Moments of Joy Galleries. They will be showing up in both the Collections Folders as well as altogether in the Moments of Joy Folder of the <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Eternal Moments</b></font> website of Photographs of Śhrī Mātājī.<br>
</p> 

<p>The link to the website is:<a href="https://eternalmoments.smugmug.com/"> website</a></p>

<p>The direct links to the altogether Handwritings Gallery are: <a href="https://eternalmoments.smugmug.com/Moments-of-Joy/Handwritings-1901-to-1917"> 1901 to 1917</a> and <a href="https://eternalmoments.smugmug.com/Moments-of-Joy/Handwritings-1975-to-2012"> 1975 to 2012</a>
[Note: the original 1 link was changed to two on 2024-0219.]</p>

<p>
Currently this gallery contains 108 handwritings (as photos) but we will gradually add more.<br>
<br>
We would be most happy to receive, enjoy, study, and share more handwritings of our Divine Mother. We thank you in advance for any help, support, and feedback. Please write to us at sahajayoga.compilations@gmail.com<br>
