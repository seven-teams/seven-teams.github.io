Dear Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginīs,<br>
<br>
We are pleased to let you know that 8 Photos from the <font color="Crimson"><b>1972-0409 Public Program, Dhule, Maharashtra, India</b></font>, as of today the first Public Program with an audio tape, have been uploaded to <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Eternal Moments</b></font>: 4 high resolutions from the Named Collections and 4 low resolutions received from internet or unknown sources. Other Photos from internet sources with an imprinted caption "&copy Sahaja yoga memories" have been regarded as 'highly edited' and as such they have not been uploaded. If you know anyone involved in 'Sahaja yoga memories', please kindly put us in touch, as our subteam would be most happy to start a proper collection of unedited Photos in a Sahaja Yoga Memories Collection.<br>
One direct link to all 8 Photos: <a href="https://eternalmoments.smugmug.com/Chronology/1972"> Chronology 1972</a>.<br>
Please kindly share the link and our email sahajayoga.compilations@gmail.com with all our brothers and sisters.<br>

<br>
Jay Śhrī Mātājī!<br>
