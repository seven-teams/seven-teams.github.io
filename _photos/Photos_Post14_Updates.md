Dear Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginīs,<br>
<br>
We are pleased to mention that, after a marathon of 18 months, all the Photos have been reuploaded with the due improvements and corrections to <a href="https://eternalmoments.smugmug.com/"> <font color="DarkGreen"><b>Eternal Moments</b></font></a>. Moreover, the addition of Moments of Joy galleries to countries has been completed.<br>
In particular, these mean that all titles of Photos are fully searchable. Moreover, extra keywords have been added to about half of the Photos, and all these extra keywords are searchable as well.<br>
Gradually: (i) all Photos will have additional keywords added to them; (ii) all photos of Moments of Joy will be reuploaded; (iii) all photos Moments of Joy will have additional keywords added to them.<br>
Despite, (i) to (iii) not being yet completed, on May 5th we have started (iv) activating the download buttons of the galleries in the Chronology Folder. As a test, the Chronology 1918, 1923 and 2011 galleries have all the Photos downloadable. We are currently (v) eliminating all the captions that have resurfaced due to reuploads and that overwrite the titles (it is a process of the type Photo by Photo verification if by chance it has a caption once reuploaded). The captions are of three categories: (a) coming from the companies that have digitized the Photos (such as 'Epson Image Scanner'), (b) contain erroneous data (like a 1996 Public Program in Budapest has the caption of a Public Program in Prague), (c) contain data that is already part of the tiles. The captions of (b) and (c) type come from either photographers or from prior sources. These eliminations of captions do not affect the metadata: one downloaded, the captions are there so that original sources can be fully traced at any time.<br>
We are aiming to complete (iv) and (v) as an offering at Shri Ganesha Puja. The main reason for this delay is the fact that we did not get time to "remind everyone about the delicate protocols that accompany the sharing of Photos" (as per the annual report), and the top priority is to have few posts on our suggestions and expectations.<br>
Please kindly share the news and the links with all our brothers and sisters.<br>
